During the leasing process for a rental property, the agent collected my Social Security Number ( SSN ), stating it was solely for verifying lease eligibility. However, I later discovered my SSN was used at a car dealership without my knowledge or consent. I have never been to or authorized dealings with this dealership. The agent mentioned that the landlord owns a dealership in XXXX, which raises serious concerns that my SSN may have been misused or shared without authorization.

The agents actions, including the potential misuse of my SSN, improper communication, failure to fulfill her obligations, and neglect of the propertys condition, demonstrate a severe lack of professionalism.

2024-12-07,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"My complaint concerns how MOHELA has classified the administrative forbearance in my account for three relevant months. In short, I have already reached 120 qualified payments for Public Student Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). My employer certification is pending with Federal Student Aid ( FSA ), but there are several issues that need to be resolved ASAP on Mohelas end, but they refuse to help by sending me back to FSA when the issue is on their end.

By the correct count, my final qualifying payment should have been XX/XX/XXXX, getting me to 120 qualifying payments. At issue with MOHELA is how it has classified two separate periods of forbearance. 

XXXX. XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX : Both these months should be listed as having a PROCESSING Forbearance that counts for PSLF, not an administrative forbearance that does not count. Since late XX/XX/XXXX, per Federal Student Aid 's guidance, I requested to be moved from SAVE ( which is currently paused and payments do not count for PSLF ) to IBR ( where payments do count for PSLF. Per FSA guidance, student loan providers that are unable to process the application for a payment swap must place borrowers in a 60 day processing forbearance, which FSA will count as qualified payments for forbearance. So, XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX should be listed as processing forbearance. 

As a last resort, if XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX do not count for whatever reason, then per Federal Student Aid guidance issued on XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted an electronic application to swap from SAVE to IBR on XX/XX/XXXX. While my application is being processed, Mohela should place. XXXX on a 60 day forbearance that should have XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX count for my XXXX qualified payments. Again, this is only last resort because per XXXX  guidance, and as a result of my repeated request to MOHELA since late XX/XX/XXXX to switch from SAVE to IBR ( see attached requests and responses ), and their confirmation on XX/XX/XXXX that my request was being processed, XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX should count as qualified payment months while I was placed on a processing forbearance 2. XX/XX/XXXX : Mohela inexplicably lists this month as being on administrative forbearance, that does not count for PSLF. However, I was pm forbearance during this period at the fault of my former loan provider while they swapped my loan payments plans. This month should also be listed as under a processing forbearance that counts for PSLF.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,CA,91791,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11069992
2024-12-07,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I have a XXXX XXXX XXXX, operated by Wells Fargo. The app will not allow me to enroll in autopay without using a Wells Fargo online account. Because I do not have any checking account or credit card with Wells Fargo, I had to create an account to do this. Despite following directions and creating the account, technical issues with Wells Fargos website prevent me from being able to log in and enroll in autopay ( I reach a screen saying to call their account support, which I have done on at least XXXX separate occasions over the last year, only to be transferred between departments and receive no resolution after hours on hold ). The app provides no notice of payment due date ( as all my other banking apps do ), and I have been charged for late payments on multiple occasions as a result of not having autopay set up and not being able to enroll. After working with customer service to reset my username and password, it is still not allowing me to enroll and I was told there was no further support they could provide besides mailing me a form to complete and send back to enroll. The barrier to enrolling in autopay is unreasonable and feels intentional to take advantage of consumers and collect on forgotten / late payments by not reminding consumers of upcoming bill due dates.

2024-12-07,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Threatened to contact someone or share information improperly,Contacted you after you asked them to stop,"Sunday, XXXX XXXX XXXX - I was served an in-person summons to the door of my home from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX The date printed on the summons and letter was XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 

***This is the first formal complaint to the CFPB as per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, communication is prohibited before XXXX. *** XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX - I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX office about cooperating to settle any issues including their explanation of a proposed payment arrangement. Shortly afterward, details were confirmed in an email from his office that we'd discussed working toward finalizing a payment arrangement. A proposed document was sent for my signature, with a start date to the agreement as XX/XX/XXXX and with very little information/clarification about the terms of the payment arrangement. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I received a copy of the same summons with plaintiff 's directions in the USPS mail. The date printed on the summons and letter was XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX - The person who had served the original summons showed up to the door of my home again. They did not leave a document, and I had received no prior notice from XXXX 's office that he would be returning, or an email afterward explaining what was attempting to be delivered to me. 

XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX - I sent a cooperative email asking questions for clarification about the proposed payment arrangement and document for my signature. Within the same email, I included a formal request for further contact and visits to my home to stop : I'd also like to confirm whoever has been knocking on my door with documents from your office will no longer need to come to my house? After he delivered the first letter/summons Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I called and spoke with your office about cooperating to settle any issues including with this proposed payment arrangement on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX which is when shortly afterward you sent this email. Since we'd already discussed and agreed on working toward finalizing a payment arrangement, I'm not sure why this person then showed up at my home again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I am happy to work with you through the issue, but personally, as a <person> living alone I am not comfortable with a man I do not know showing up to my home, especially so early in the morning, on weekends, and after we'd already agreed on moving forward with working toward a payment arrangement, him showing up again without me knowing he is coming. That makes me extremely uncomfortable and I believe is against the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Now that we are finalizing a payment arrangement, I'd like to request there are no more phone calls, emails, letters, visits to my home or otherwise unless it is in regard to clarifying my questions about the terms of a payment arrangement or if I've somehow not met the terms of a payment arrangement when we have all of the items clarified and finalized. 

XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I mailed the required Answer and Denial document copies to XXXX office via USPS priority. 

XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received an email from XXXX office confirming receipt of yesterdays email, answering the questions contained in the email, but did not include acknowledgement of my request to cease further aggressive contact. 
XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I filed the required Answer and Denial documents with the County Court XXXX 

XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Cooperative emails remained going back and forth between myself and XXXX office to confirm all details working to finalize a resolution ; the last email from myself waiting for a reply from XXXX office. 

XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX - The person who had served the original summons showed up to the door of my home again. They did not leave a document, and I had received no prior notice from XXXX 's office that he would be returning, or an email afterward explaining what was attempting to be delivered to me. 

***This is the second formal complaint to the CFPB as per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, communication is prohibited if a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that the consumer wishes the debt collector to cease further communication with the consumer. *** XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I sent a cooperative email asking for a reply to the last email I had sent to XXXX office on XX/XX/XXXX in attempt to resolve the issue. Also within the email was a second request that there be no more people sent to my home on behalf the issue at hand. 
As of today XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX, they came to my home again. I am going to send an email today requesting them to stop contact again. I have not done anything against the agreement I signed with them, I have made all payments and I have asked them if there is information that they need and they have not responded or contacted me besides sending this person to my home. 

Consumer wants to following added to the resolution : It can be added to the bottom portion of the resolution : They need to stop showing up to my home immediately, it is giving me extreme anxiety.

Specifically, there have been {$2900.00} in unauthorized transactions associated with XXXX ( Claim No. 
XXXX ) that have remained on my account for over a year and a half. 

I first contacted Bank of America about this issue on XX/XX/XXXX, but despite my efforts, the fraudulent charges have not been resolved. On XX/XX/XXXX, a representative informed me they could not find the charge after I submitted documentation. I was told that the back office needed to confirm the information. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was again informed that the charges had not been resolved and that Bank of America would need to issue me a check for the claim and associated fees. I was promised a callback that never occurred. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I escalated the issue with a representative named XXXX, who indicated this should have been resolved by now. Subsequent interactions included a call on XX/XX/XXXX, where I was assured a follow-up call would occur on XX/XX/XXXX, which did not happen. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX, a manager, who transferred me to the billing dispute department but stated they could not resolve disputes related to the small business credit card. I have continually been left without a resolution, and it is causing significant financial strain. 

Additionally, I have had various interactions with representatives, including XXXX XXXX in XXXX and XXXX XXXX in XXXX all of which have led to no resolution. The total amount in question, including other fees, is {$1400.00} plus the {$2900.00} in fraudulent charges.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",SC,29745,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11065951

I never opened an account with XXXX XXXX through TD Bank XXXX XXXX. This is an identity theft issue. There were unauthorized payments to my XXXXXXXX XXXX account from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. For example, the payments were withdrawn every month in the amount of {$61.00}, {$35.00}, and {$31.00}. I thought they were payments for my phone carrier bill. But they were not. Someone used my identity to pay the unknown product I did not authorize. The total amount XXXX XXXX charged to my XXXXXXXX XXXX  account is approximately over {$2100.00}. Therefore, I closed my XXXX checking account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from TD Retail Card Services. It said "" This letter is in response to your report of a fraudulently opened account in your name. We have closed the above referenced account to prevent its future use. You will not be responsible for any purchases made on this account. '' But the company opened another account in my name to receive remaining payments for purchases made by the identity theft. On XX/XX/XXXX, they company mailed me another letter saying "" Please be advised, due to the unauthorized transaction, account ending in XXXX was closed for your security, and a new account number ending in XXXX was established. Please refer to your next billing statement for your account number and minimum monthly payment. '' This is fraudulent because I never requested to open another account after I noticed the unauthorized transactions in my XXXX bank account. This doesn't make sense at all.

There is information on my consumer report that I did not provide written permission, instructions, or consent to be reported on my consumer report as a result of identity theft. Therefore, I am formally requesting that the reporting of this inaccurate and fraudulent information be blocked and deleted. 
My request for the blockage and deletion of this data is not a mistake, nor is it founded on any misrepresentation of facts on my part. I am committed to ensuring the accuracy and integrity of my credit report, and as such, I am rightfully seeking the removal of these wrongfully attributed transactions. It is crucial to clarify that the transactions identified in my report are in no way associated with any of my legitimate financial activities. As the victim of identity theft, these transactions do not represent any transaction undertaken by me as the rightful consumer. 
In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I am entitled to a fair and accurate representation of my credit history. I kindly ask that you investigate this situation promptly and take the necessary steps to remove the fraudulent accounts from my credit report. I understand the importance of a correct credit profile and its implications for my financial well-being. 
Enclosed with this letter are copies of documents substantiating my identity and the fraudulent nature of the reported transactions and trust that these documents will provide the evidence required to facilitate a swift resolution of this issue. I kindly request a written confirmation once the fraudulent accounts have been removed from my credit report. 
The identified transactions are not information related to any transaction by me as the consumer and must be deleted and removed from reporting on my credit report : XXXX XXXX XXXX Acc # XXXX, ACCOUNT XXXX  XXXX  XXXX account # XXXXAcount XXXX  XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX inquiry In accordance with the regulations stipulated in 15 U.S. Code 1681b, governing the permissible purposes of consumer reports, I hereby demand the immediate removal of all inquiries not initiated by myself from my credit reports. Specifically, the following inquiries are unauthorized and must be promptly deleted : You are required to do what I am asking and block these transactions from being reported to my consumer report within 4 days from the date of the receipt of this notice. I look forward to your response. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am formally disputing the inaccurate and unverified entries on my credit report, which have significantly impacted my ability to obtain a mortgage to buy a home for my family. I have spent over five months attempting to resolve these discrepancies with the credit bureaus without success. Despite my numerous disputes, the credit reporting agencies have failed to verify these debts, provide documentation, or correct the errors, in violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other relevant laws. 

The following accounts are under dispute due to inaccuracies, missing or unverified documentation, and failure to correct or remove erroneous information : XXXX - FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ), which requires that a consumer can request the full details and verification of any debt reported. This account has not been validated by the creditor after multiple requests, violating my right to have accurate and verifiable information reported. 

REGIONS BANK - FCRA Section 1681i, which mandates that if a consumer disputes an item, the credit reporting agency must investigate the dispute within a reasonable time. XXXX XXXX XXXX failure to provide validation of the debt within the 30-day window violates this law. 
XXXX - FCRA Section 1681e ( b ) obligates the reporting agencies to maintain accurate and up-to-date records. The inaccurate reporting of this account continues despite my multiple attempts to request supporting documentation, leading to a violation of my right to fair and accurate credit reporting. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) - FCRA Section 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) requires that any information provided must be thoroughly investigated and corrected if inaccurate. XXXX has not provided any adequate verification, and the account continues to be incorrectly reported. 
XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) - FCRA Section 1681s-2 ( b ) outlines the responsibilities of furnishers of information to ensure accurate reporting. XXXX has not met these responsibilities, leaving inaccurate information on my report without verification. 
XXXX XXXX - Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Section 1692g requires validation of debts when disputed. I have not received adequate proof of the debt 's validity, and the reporting remains inaccurate across multiple bureaus. 
XXXX XXXX ( second listing ) - The repeated inaccurate reporting of this account violates both the FCRA and the FDCPA, as the account has not been properly validated or corrected after my disputes. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX  -FCRA Section 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate and resolve disputes in a timely manner. XXXX XXXX failure to provide verification of the debt or correct the report after multiple disputes constitutes a violation of this law. 
The presence of these inaccuracies is preventing me from obtaining a mortgage, which has a direct and negative impact on my ability to purchase a home for my family. I have made every effort to correct the errors, but the credit bureaus have failed to act within the parameters of the law, causing ongoing financial harm. 

Despite my repeated requests for validation and documentation, I have yet to receive any proof of these debts or their accurate reporting.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am writing to formally dispute the reporting of an auto repossession on my credit report under account XXXX XXXX. This account was previously removed from my XXXX credit file, which demonstrates that the information is either inaccurate, unverifiable, or incomplete. Also, this account is being inaccurately reported for the full loan amount instead of reflecting the proper deficiency balance after the vehicle was sold at auction, as required by law. Furthermore, I was not provided with a required notice detailing the auction results and the remaining balance, which further invalidates the accuracy of this reporting. Therefore, I am requesting that you immediately investigate and remove this account from my credit file as required by federal law. 

Under 15 USC 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and consistent records. Disparities in reporting across the XXXX major bureaus call into question the accuracy of the information being furnished and your adherence to your duty under the FCRA to ensure maximum accuracy in consumer credit reports ( 15 USC 1681e ( b ) ). Credit bureaus must report only accurate, complete, and verifiable information. Reporting the full loan amount after a repossession and sale violates this standard of accuracy.

UCC 9-611 and 9-616 ( Uniform Commercial Code ) : Creditors are required to notify the borrower in writing of the time and place of the auction or sale of repossessed collateral ( 9-611 ). Additionally, after the sale, the creditor must provide an explanation of how the proceeds were applied, including the deficiency balance ( 9-616 ). Failure to provide this notice invalidates the debt or the claimed deficiency amount. 

Additionally, the failure to verify the accuracy of this account may also constitute a violation of 15 USC 1681i, which requires prompt reinvestigation when a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of an item. Given that XXXX has already removed this account, I believe the same standard of accuracy should apply to your records. 

If the furnisher of this information ( XXXX XXXX  ) is unable to provide documentation verifying its accuracy and compliance with those applicable laws I stated, you must remove the account immediately. Reporting unverifiable or incomplete information violates 15 USC 1681s-2 ( b ), which prohibits furnishers from knowingly reporting inaccurate data.

I am also concerned that continuing to report this repossession despite its removal from another bureau may lead to harm under 15 USC 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which provide for remedies in cases of willful or negligent noncompliance with the FCRA. 

Reasons for Dispute : XXXX. Failure to Provide Required Notices : I did not receive a pre-sale notice or post-sale explanation of the proceeds and deficiency balance, as required by UCC 9-611 and 9-616. Without these notices, the creditor is in violation of its legal obligations, and the reporting of the debt is invalid. 

XXXX. Incorrect Amount Reported : If the repossessed vehicle was sold, only the deficiency balance ( remaining amount after the sale proceeds were applied ) can be reported, not the full loan amount. Reporting the full balance is a clear violation of 15 USC 1681e ( b ), requiring accuracy in credit reporting. 


Requested actions : I respectfully request that you XXXX. Reinvestigate the Account : I request that you reinvestigate this account and verify its accuracy with the furnisher of the information and require the furnisher to provide COMPLETE documentation verifying its accuracy. 

XXXX. Obtain Proof of Notices and Accuracy : Require the furnisher to provide documentation of the auction results, the pre-sale and post-sale notices, and the calculation of the deficiency balance. If they can not provide this information, the account must be removed from my report. 

XXXX. Correct or Remove the Account : If the information can not be verified or is found to be incomplete or inaccurate, this account must be corrected or removed from my credit file as required under 15 USC 1681i. 

XXXX. Provide me with a written response within 30 days, as required by the FCRA, detailing the results of your investigation and any actions taken. 


Please note that I am prepared to escalate this dispute to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), or other appropriate authorities if necessary.

I understand the importance of a correct credit profile and its implications for my financial well-being.

I kindly request a written confirmation once the fraudulent accounts have been removed from my credit report.

2024-12-07,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Cashing a check,"Formal Complaint Regarding Fraudulent Check Deposit and Bank Handling I am writing to formally lodge a serious complaint regarding the mishandling of our account, the fraudulent deposit of a check, and the banks lack of proper procedures to prevent such incidents. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, we were unable to log into the TD Bank app. We called customer service and were told that our account had been frozen. The next day, we went to a TD Bank branch and spoke with the manager, who confirmed the account was frozen. We requested the funds in the account to be returned to us, and the manager said they needed approval from higher-ups to decide whether the money would be returned through the branch or via a mailed check.

We went back to work, and the following day, we received a call saying that only the funds in the checking account could be returned to us, while the money in the savings account would be sent to our address by mail within about seven days. We repeatedly asked the manager if the check could only be deposited into the account of the payee and if others wouldnt be able to deposit it. The manager confirmed this and stated that the bank would only issue one check. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we noticed that a newly issued XXXX credit card ending XXXX hadnt arrived yet, but fraudulent transactions had already occurred. Fortunately, XXXX had blocked these transactions. Since we were working, we couldnt check the mail daily. On XX/XX/XXXX, we went back to TD Bank to speak with the manager about the check because we suspected it might have been stolen. However, the manager told us to wait another week and return if the check hadnt been received. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a check for {$75000.00} with the account number ending in XXXX. We assumed this was the check for the savings account because the manager had said the bank would only send one check. On XX/XX/XXXX, the check was rejected by the bank. We went to TD Bank around XXXXXXXX XXXX, but the manager wasnt available, and the staff said no one could handle the issue. They emailed to inquire about the check, and the staff advised me to come back on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we were notified by TD Bank that the check issued for our savings account ( ending in XXXX ) in the amount of {$76000.00} had been fraudulently deposited. However, the bank has yet to determine which bank the check was deposited into. This is extremely concerning, as we were assured that only the payee could deposit the check, and that no one else would be able to do so. We were also told that the bank would only issue one check, which we received on XX/XX/XXXX, under the assumption that it was the correct one for the savings account. 

We have never receive the check.We are deeply troubled by the fact that the check, which should have been sent to us, was stolen and successfully deposited by someone else. We are particularly alarmed by the fact that such a significant sum was deposited without proper verification, especially given the circumstances. We were never informed that someone other than the account holder could deposit the check, nor were we advised of any safeguards or verification processes in place to prevent this type of fraudulent activity. Why was such a large amount allowed to be deposited into another bank without proper checks? 

The handling of this situation has been deeply frustrating. Since the check was fraudulently deposited, we have had to take additional steps, including reporting the matter to the police. We are very concerned about the lack of accountability and the apparent failure to safeguard our funds, which has resulted in significant distress. 

I respectfully request an immediate investigation into this matter, along with a full explanation of the actions taken by the bank to prevent fraud and the procedures followed in processing our check. I also request that the bank take responsibility for the loss of funds and provide us with a clear plan for how this situation will be rectified. 

I expect a prompt and thorough response to this complaint, and I trust that TD Bank will take appropriate action to address this issue and prevent any future occurrences of this nature.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NY,11219,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11069668

I demand the late payment reported in ( MONTHS REPORTING LATE ) to be removed.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

They have never sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided.

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 
YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. 

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown. 
1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves. 
2. What is a FCRA violation? 
Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. 
Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes. 
3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes. 
Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions. 
Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable. 
Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ). 
I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes. 
The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2.

What is being reported is below.

THE ABOVE ACVOUNT Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Metro 2 guidelines established by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ), I request that your organization investigate and correct any inaccuracies or non-compliant reporting associated with this account. 

Account Information : Creditor Name : [ Creditor Name ] Account Number : [ Account Number ] Date ( s ) of Alleged Late Payments : [ List Dates ] Upon reviewing my credit report, I noticed that the late payment information reported for this account appears to violate the Metro 2 format standards, which require accurate, complete, and consistent data reporting. Specifically, I believe that the following Metro 2 compliance codes may not have been applied correctly : Compliance Condition Code ( CCC ) : Late payments must be reported with proper CCC designations to indicate the account 's actual status during the period in question. 

Payment Rating Field : This field must accurately reflect the timeliness of payments based on the billing cycle. Misreported data here could result in erroneous late payment reporting. 

Account Status Code : This must align with the current account condition. An outdated or incorrect status could inaccurately reflect delinquencies. 

Date of First Delinquency ( DOFD ) : Any late payment information must include a proper DOFD to ensure compliance with credit reporting standards. 

Given the potential for inaccurate reporting, I request that your organization : Conduct a thorough investigation of the reporting for this account. 

Validate the accuracy of the reported late payments against Metro 2 standards. 

Provide documentation supporting the accuracy of the reporting if no changes are made. 

Remove or correct any data that is inconsistent with the Metro 2 guidelines or FCRA requirements. 

Please consider this letter a formal dispute under the FCRA. I have enclosed copies of my credit report highlighting the disputed entries, as well as any supporting documentation that may assist in your investigation. 

I expect to receive a response to this dispute within 30 days, as stipulated under the FCRA. If the inaccuracies are not corrected, I may escalate this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) or take legal action to ensure compliance.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX filed an identity theft report through the FTC, ( XXXX ) I also included a police report ( XXXX ) cover letter of dispute. Copy of identification, validation documentation of my legal address and a lease agreement without signatures per leesee request. 

I sent these documents through US mail to all 3 major credit bereaus, I also uploaded the documentation, police report and FTC report to all 3 bereaus. 

I've actually uploaded the supporting documentation multiple times to all of the Bereaus, XXXX, Experian and XXXX throughout the month of XXXX. 

Since uploading the original documentation plus a dispute letter outlining my rights through the resource pages on the FTC website I have uploaded additional documentation validating my residence outside of the US from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

The accts that were not blocked or deleted were disputed originally and again on XX/XX/XXXX when I uploaded the lease agreement to all 3 bereaus. 

XXXX and Experian have platforms that provide multiple ways of disputing accts on my credit report and XXXX website is set up to navigate the user through a sales funnel for the paid membership that they offer users that require frequent credit reports and scores. 
Since beginning the repair journey I've logged over 26hours online and on chat plus phone calls to agents at XXXX. 
Nothing in that entire time has provided online access to my credit report. 
They continual share the same troubleshooting data that they have in script and that I have followed multiple times to get a copy of my report. 

I recently filed a dispute about the issues with Transunions timeliness and less than attentive concern to address the inquiries and fraudulent accts that are still on my credit report. My request was to get results or answers to my original dispute and identity theft case filed early XXXX. 
XXXX has told me that the platform they use has technical issues and that they will be resolved within 2 to 3 days of time however this is not true, I can not access my credit report through the XXXX platform. 

My request is that XXXX remove the hard inquiries from my credit report as they are fraudulent and numerous, I also request that they block the additional accts that I disputed with documentation on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX with validating documentation that I included with all of my disputes. 

The complaint that I filed prevuousky through CFPB about XXXX barely touches the issues, delays and absence of action that XXXX has exampled throughout my effort to restore my good credit standing. The process has not been as stated in the Fair Credit Reporting Act and I want the hard inquiries and fraudulent accts blocked from my profile, and from potential credit opportunities. 
The response that I received after using this platform to express the problems that have been encountered do not hold this company accountable for the lack of action and the lack of progress despite following the FTC guidelines to restore my credit rating to pre identity theft condition. 
By allowing XXXX additional time after 30 days has passed is not providing me the consumer with anything that I wasn't already experiencing before addressing my issues to the CFPB. 

PLEASE make XXXX address the identity theft accts on my report, remove all of the fraudulent inquiries so I can begin to build a healthy FICO score. The opportunity that having good credit provides has been stolen from me and time is of the essence. I own a company and can not provide the basics of ownership to the people that XXXX employee. Getting funding of any amount to grow the company in order to hire more people is passing me by and the time, effort and energy that I have applied to just getting back to XXXX has been mountainous by any standard. 

My request is to not give this company any more of the most valuable commodity we have as humans, TIME. 
Please make this company do the right thing and remove the negative and fraudulent inquiries that plaque my credit profile immediately. 

Thank you so very much! 

With respect, consideration.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Experian Credit Union XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Subject : Dispute Regarding CFPB Complaint # XXXX Dear Experian, This letter serves as a formal demand for immediate corrective action regarding the inaccurate reporting of the XXXX XXXX account ending in XXXX on my consumer report. Per your response to CFPB Complaint # XXXX, you stated that the account was verified with the original creditor, XXXX XXXX . However, my original dispute explicitly outlined why this account should either reflect a {$0.00} balance or be removed entirely, as XXXX XXXX has failed to provide proof of debt cancellation or otherwise substantiate the alleged debt. 
Background and Current Issues 1. XXXX XXXX XXXX Lack of Verification XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed that the account was charged off. However, despite my request, they have failed to provide a 1099-C forma document required to verify any cancellation of debt reported to the IRS. Instead, they assert that I remain obligated for the debt without providing the legally required documentation to support their claim. 
2. Experian 's Inaccurate Reporting o By continuing to report this account without verification, Experian is knowingly disseminating inaccurate and unverifiable information. This action directly violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
Laws Violated 1. 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Information o Experian is obligated to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information it reports. Failing to remove or update this account to reflect a {$0.00} balance violates this provision. 
2. 15 U.S. Code 1681i Dispute Resolution o Experian must conduct a thorough investigation when a consumer disputes an account. If the original creditor can not or will not verify the accuracy of the account, Experian must either delete it or update it to reflect accurate information. By relying solely on unverifiable information from XXXX XXXX, Experian has violated this section. 
3. 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) Furnisher Responsibilities o XXXX XXXX , as the furnisher of this information, is obligated to report only accurate and complete information. Their failure to provide a 1099-C while claiming the debt remains owed contradicts their reporting to the IRS, thereby violating this provision. 
4. 15 U.S. Code 1681c Obsolete Information o If this account was charged off and reported to the IRS as a loss, it is either canceled debt or an uncollectible charge-off. Reporting such an account with a balance due is misleading and does not align with the FCRA 's requirements to ensure accurate reporting. 
Demand for Immediate Action I demand that Experian : 1. Update the Account to Reflect a {$0.00} Balance o Since this account was reported to the IRS as a charge-off or canceled debt, it must reflect this on my consumer report. 
2. Delete the Account Entirely o If XXXX XXXX can not or will not provide sufficient verification of the debt, this account must be removed from my consumer report under FCRA guidelines. 
3. Provide a Detailed Response o Provide me with a written explanation of the steps Experian has taken to ensure compliance with the FCRA, including details of your investigation process for this account. 
Failure to comply with the FCRA and rectify this issue will leave me no choice but to pursue further legal remedies, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and seeking civil damages as allowed under 15 U.S. Code 1681n ( Willful Noncompliance ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681o ( Negligent Noncompliance ).

It outlines the requirements for removal of certain negative items after a specified period, as follows : Key Provisions of Section 605 ( FCRA ) Regarding Credit Reporting : 1. General Time Limitations on Negative Information : Most negative information, such as accounts in collections or charged-off accounts, can remain on your credit report for up to 7 years from the date of the first delinquency that led to the negative status. 

XXXX. Bankruptcies : XXXX XXXX  bankruptcies can remain for 10 years, while XXXX XXXX bankruptcies remain for 7 years. 

3. Fraudulent Accounts : Under Section 605B of the FCRA, if an account is opened fraudulently ( as in the case of identity theft ), you are not liable for the fraudulent debt, and the account must be removed from your credit report once you report the fraud to the credit bureaus. 

4. Inaccurate Information : Any information that is inaccurate or incomplete must be corrected or removed from your credit report after a dispute investigation. If the information can not be verified, it must be removed from your report.

5. Fraud Alerts and Identity Theft Protections : If youve filed a fraud report, you have the right to request a fraud alert or to place a credit freeze, and fraudulent accounts should be removed from your credit report once you present evidence such as a police report and FTC identity theft report.

How This Applies to my Situation : Since I have reported the account as fraudulent ( via the XXXX Police Department report and FTC identity theft affidavit ), Section 605B applies to my case. 

Under the FCRA, once the identity theft is reported and verified, Experian is required to remove the fraudulent account from my credit report, even if XXXX continues to assert the account is valid. 



XXXX. So I'm Contacting Experian Directly : Explicitly reference Section 605B of the FCRA that under the law, the fraudulent account must be removed from your credit report due to the identity theft reports I have filed with the XXXX Police Department and the FTC. 

XXXX. Include Supporting Documents : attach the XXXX Police Report and the FTC Identity Theft Report to to my dispute, as these are key pieces of evidence to support my claim. 

XXXX. I'm Cite FCRA Requirements : Experian Subject : Formal Dispute Request for Removal of Fraudulent Account Under FCRA Section 605B Dear Experian, I am writing to formally dispute the reporting of a XXXX XXXX account ( Account Number : XXXX ) on my credit report. As previously stated, this account was opened fraudulently without my knowledge or consent, and I have provided supporting documentation, including a XXXX Police Department report and an FTC identity theft affidavit. 



Under Section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), once I report identity theft and provide documentation confirming the fraudulent nature of the account, you are required to remove the fraudulent account from my credit report. As a victim of identity theft, I am entitled to have this account removed, and I request that you take immediate action to comply with the law. 



Please find attached the following documents for your review : XXXX Police Department Report ( XXXX XXXX : XXXX ). 

FTC Identity Theft Report ( Report Number : XXXX ). 



I kindly request that you promptly update my credit report to reflect the removal of this fraudulent account. If the account can not be verified as legitimate, it must be removed from my credit file in accordance with the FCRA. 



I expect your response within the 30-day timeframe required under the FCRA. Should you fail to take the appropriate action, I will pursue further remedies, including escalating this matter with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and considering legal options.

I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding an issue I encountered with Experian related to the removal of a remark from my credit report and the subsequent resubmission of that remark without proper certification, which I believe violates federal law. 

On XX/XX/year>, I contacted Experians customer service and spoke with a representative named XXXX ( confirmation number : XXXX ). During this conversation, I was informed that a remark associated with my credit accounts from XXXX and XXXX XXXX had been removed. However, this remark was later resubmitted to my credit report without the proper certification as required by federal law. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I understand that credit reporting agencies must ensure that all information reported is accurate and verifiable. It is my belief that Experian has failed to comply with these requirements by allowing XXXX and XXXX XXXX to resubmit the remark without a certification, which I understand is required for such actions. 

I respectfully request that your office investigate this matter thoroughly. The resubmission of this remark without the necessary documentation appears to be a clear violation of federal regulations, and I am seeking your assistance in ensuring this issue is corrected and that my credit report is accurately updated.

At no point did I receive a written notice from Credence informing me of this alleged debt, as required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 1692g ( a ). This notice is critical because it would have outlined my rights to dispute the debt and request validation within 30 days of their initial contact. 

Additionally, the lack of notice has denied me the opportunity to properly address or dispute the debt before it was reported to the credit bureaus, which is a violation of my consumer rights under both the FDCPA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Credence 's failure to notify me and provide me with the opportunity to dispute the debt prior to reporting it has caused unnecessary harm to my credit and financial well-being. 

I am requesting that Credence : Immediately provide full validation of the alleged debt, including any agreements or documentation tying me to the debt. 
Remove the entry from my credit report until proper validation is completed. 
Ensure full compliance with federal laws, including providing written notice and an opportunity to dispute any alleged debt in the future.

I am XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX held to highest degree and regard of moral, civil, and ethical duties and dealings. I am gainfully employed and do not engage in low vibrational and distasteful acts such as what is being described below. 
Unsure of exact initial dates, but on or about XX/XX/2024 I was contacted by an XXXX XXXX  fraud department representative regarding "" potential fraudulent activities '' that had taken place on my fathers bank account in which I am a co op due to him developing XXXX XXXX. I was informed that there were several checks that were deposited into his primary account ( which is where he received his SSI checks every month ) and the bank cleared but returned back as "" bad checks ''. This was my first time learning of these circumstances and I explained to the representative that the checks in fact had to be fraudulent because I did not recognize the names of the individuals that appeared on them. I also explained that I was only on the account because of my fathers failing cognition and just in case we ever ran into problems such as him losing his card or inability to access his account, that my being on there would streamline this process of getting these issues situated, yet I've never as much passed a check through his account nor do I receive monetary gains through this account. The representative asked me to get in contact with my father because they were having no success at getting ahold of him because of phone connectivity issues. She did inform me at this time that they would proceed to close the account the first week of XXXX if there was no resolve. I would end up having the same issues with phone connectivity with my father as well and was unsuccessful at verifying things until the account was "" closed '' with XXXX XXXX. Once I was able to get to my father, he did inform me that his wallet was stolen ( which because of his XXXX XXXX, he kept his PIN number to his ATM card taped to the back of his card ). 
On or around XXXX, XXXX, I was attempting to be placed on my Husbands bank account with XXXX XXXX  when I was informed by the XXXX representative who ran a consumer banking report that I would not be able to be placed on his account due to me being flagged by "" XXXX '' for "" fraudulent check activity ''. I immediately requested my XXXX file and received my consumer report in the mail late XX/XX/2024 which did state that I was reported for "" Suspected fraudulent activity '' involving an unpaid balance of {$2300.00}, owed to XXXX XXXX. After becoming aware of this, I made a trip up to XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX, Kansas where I was able to speak to a management team member by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX did provide me a copy of the bank statements showing that there had been a total of 3 checks that were apparently deposited at the ATM into my fathers account. I asked XXXX were any camera 's used to attempt to catch those responsible for the fraudulent activities to which her response was "" no ''. I asked XXXX if they tried to validate who wrote out the checks because the handwriting was not mines nor my fathers, to which XXXX responded "" no ''. Thirdly, I asked to see who endorsed the checks to check the signature and to my surprise, none of the three checks were ever endorsed. I asked XXXX why did the bank not take responsibility for allowing the checks to completely clear without an endorsement on the back to which her response was "" we were using the "" good faith '' rule to allow them to clear, as we have never had any issues with your fathers account in the past ''. XXXX refused to reverse their decision to "" hold me responsible '' for their bank allowing unendorsed, fraudulent checks to clear with every indication that these checks were not legit. 
Unfortunately, I have been denied access to being added to my husbands bank account with XXXX XXXX  due to me being added to XXXX, I have been denied an auto loan with my own XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and most recently learned that the fraudulent checks have been passed to a third party who have now flogged me that much more by adding a "" collections account '' to my credit report, which has lowered my score more than XXXX XXXX. Not to mention my aging father has suffered all the same. 
Please see all exhibits attached below including the checks deposited with no endorsement, my fathers one page bank statement showing the banks allowed the cashing of the fraudulent checks, and my personal XXXX XXXX file showing the suspicious activity alert and amount owed to XXXX XXXX  ( as well as the many credit pulls I had attempting to gain access to a new auto loan for which I was denied, this includes my personal credit union who I've been in excellent standing with for more than 13 years ).

Specifically : 1. An account reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) regarding a vehicle loan. 
2. An account reported by XXXX Bank, which I have never had any dealings with. 

I have never opened an account with either XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, nor have I had any financial transactions or agreements with these institutions. The reporting of these accounts is false, unverifiable, and a violation of my consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681.

As per the FCRA, you are required to ensure all information on my credit report is accurate and verifiable. Failure to do so constitutes a direct violation of federal law. These accounts can not be verified because they are fraudulent and do not belong to me.

Demands : 1. Remove these accounts from my credit report immediately and ensure no further reporting from these institutions regarding these accounts.

2. Provide written confirmation of the removal of these accounts within three ( 3 ) days of receiving this letter. 
3. Cease reporting any negative or unauthorized information about me from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, or any related entities. 

Failure to act within the specified timeframe will leave me no choice but to escalate this matter by filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursuing legal remedies. 

I have attached a copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed accounts for your reference, along with the required proof of my identity, including a government-issued ID and utility bill. 

Please treat this correspondence as a formal and urgent dispute. I expect a resolution within the next three ( 3 ) business days to avoid further action.

2024-12-07,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Re : Account No. XXXX Continued Debt Dispute, Consumer Rights Violations, and Immediate Demand for Compliance Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to demand immediate compliance with my previous request for debt validation and to address multiple violations of my consumer rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Despite my initial contact in XX/XX/XXXX and subsequent communications, Transworld Systems continues to fail to meet its legal obligations. 

Chronological Events Regarding this Account : XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : Mailed Certified Letter Requesting Debt Validation o On this date, I mailed a certified letter to Transworld Systems requesting full validation of the alleged debt in accordance with my rights under the FDCPA. I demanded a signed agreement between myself and the original creditor, as well as proof of assignment and the monetary compensation accepted by XXXX XXXX XXXX for this debt. 

2. Follow-Up Call to Transworld Systems o After receiving no adequate response to my request, I called Transworld Systems to follow up. During this call, a representative unlawfully requested that I pay {$1.00} to receive debt validation, which is a direct violation of the FDCPA. A consumer is not required to make any payment to receive validation of a debt. 

3. Filed a Complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) - Case # XXXX o On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) under Case # XXXX due to Transworld Systems ' failure to provide the requested debt validation. However, Transworld Systems marked the case as a duplicate and did not properly investigate or resolve the matter, which further violates my rights. 

XXXX. Opened Another CFPB Case - Case # XXXX o After the initial complaint went unresolved, I opened another case with the CFPB under Case # XXXX, requesting an investigation into Transworld Systems ' ongoing non-compliance with my original request from XX/XX/XXXX. Despite this, I received yet another letter from Transworld Systems confirming their non-compliance, further substantiating their violations. 

FDCPA and FCRA Violations : Below, I have outlined the specific violations under the FDCPA and FCRA that Transworld Systems is committing : 1. Failure to Provide Adequate Debt Validation ( FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ) o Under the FDCPA, upon receiving a consumer 's request for debt validation, a debt collector must cease all collection activity until they provide the requested validation. This includes providing a copy of the signed agreement with the original creditor and proof of assignment. Transworld Systems has failed to provide these documents, which is a direct violation of the law. 

2. Failure to Cease Collection Activities ( FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ) o Transworld Systems has not ceased collection activities, including reporting this debt to the credit bureaus, while the debt remains in dispute. Under the FDCPA, once a debt is disputed, they are required to halt all collection actions until proper validation is provided. 

3. Failure to Provide Proof of Debt Assignment and Transfer ( FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) ; FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) ) o I have requested proof of assignment and proof of the transfer of this debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX  to Transworld Systems , including the amount paid for the debt. These documents are critical to properly validate the debt, yet Transworld Systems has failed to provide any such evidence, violating both the FDCPA and FCRA. 

4. Unlawful Request for Payment to Validate Debt ( FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ) o During a phone conversation with a representative, I was unlawfully asked to pay {$1.00} in order to receive debt validation, which is an explicit violation of the FDCPA. Debt collectors are prohibited from requesting payment in exchange for debt validation. This request is not only inappropriate but also unlawful under FDCPA Section 1692g ( b ), which prohibits the imposition of any fees for validation. 

XXXX. Failure to Investigate CFPB Complaints ( FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692d, 1692e ) o After filing my complaints with the CFPB ( Case # XXXX and XXXX # XXXX ), Transworld Systems failed to investigate and resolve the matter properly. Instead, they marked the complaint as a duplicate and failed to provide the necessary documentation and response. This behavior constitutes deceptive and misleading practices, as outlined in FDCPA Section 1692d and 1692e.",,TRANSWORLD SYSTEMS INC,CA,91709,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11068108

I checked my bank and asked what the fraudulent activity was. They said that somebody had called saying that someone had opened an account with their name with my bank. I was then confused so I decided to check my credit report. I checked all three credit bureaus and realized that XXXX of the XXXX credit bureaus had multiple credit reports on my file that were not mine. XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the particular credit bureau on their website and submitted a dispute for the many reports on file that did not belong to me. I was not able to handle the dispute online and was directed to call the number of that XXXX credit bureau for further help. The person that was helping me on the phone was able to pretty much remove every report that was not mine as it seems there was a credit file mix. However, a couple months later, I noticed that XXXX of the reports was not removed from my credit report from the other person. And that report happens to be a bankruptcy which is affecting my credit in a very negative way. XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a bankruptcy dispute to contact that XXXX credit bureau to have that bankruptcy that did not belong to me removed from my credit report. Unfortunately, they did not remove the bankruptcy from my credit report, so I decided to act and contact the court that issued the bankruptcy and tell them that it was not mine. They also told me that I would have to contact the credit Bureau and file a dispute which I had already done previously. I ended up submitting a second bankruptcy dispute with new updates from the court that issued the bankruptcy to the other individual.

Last month I requested an investigation because I felt the item was not being reported legally. Couple of days ago I received a letter stating that you have ceased investigation of my credit reports because, in your opinion, you believe that I have used a third-party credit repair agency. Not only do I believe this to be a stall tactic on your part to grant you an additional 30 days to comply with my original request, but I believe it to be a blatant violation of the FCRA. 
I have attached a copy of my government issued ID as well as mail showing proof of address. So, there shouldnt be no confusion or stall tactics on your end. I have maintained a careful record of my communications with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the FTC should you continue in your non-compliance.

Subject : Demand for Immediate Late Payment Removal To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally demand the immediate removal of the late payment from all credit reporting agencies due to your blatant violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Account Number : XXXX Under FCRA XXXX XXXX ( a ) ( XXXX ), it is your legal obligation to notate an account as in dispute once a consumer challenges its accuracy. You have failed to fulfill this requirement, despite my previous dispute notification. This constitutes a serious violation of federal law and demonstrates your reckless disregard for my rights as a consumer.

Your failure to properly update the dispute status of this account means you are reporting false and misleading information. According to FCRA 1681s-2, this violation provides me with automatic grounds for account removal.

I am demanding that you : 1. Immediately remove this late payment from all credit reporting agencies.

2. Provide written confirmation of the late payment deletion within 15 days.

Failure to Comply Will Result in Legal Action : If you do not comply with this demand, I will take the following action without further notice : File formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ).

Pursue legal action under FCRA Sections 1681n and 1681o for willful or negligent noncompliance, which may include claims for statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees.

This is your final opportunity to correct your violation and avoid legal consequences. I expect your full cooperation and confirmation that the account has been removed from my credit report.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Upon reviewing my consumer reports, I discovered multiple late payment entries associated with my account that were inaccurately reported. As you are aware, Consumer Reporting Agencies bear a significant responsibility to ensure that all consumer information is reported with maximum accuracy. It is essential that the information reflected on my credit profile is both accurate and truthful. 

Specifically, I have never been late with any payments for my XXXX XXXX account ( Account # XXXX ). I respectfully request a thorough investigation into these erroneous late payment entries and demand that you provide verifiable proof, including statements, that demonstrate these payments were indeed late. To assist in this process, I can provide supporting documentation, including bank statements, payment notifications, timestamps from the XXXX payment app, and screenshots. 

Additionally, it is important to note that there have been substantial testimonies and reviews from numerous XXXX customers who have experienced similar issues regarding premature reporting of late payments. These reports indicate a pattern of errors where late payment flags are applied prematurely, negatively impacting credit scores. This further highlights the possibility of an internal issue with XXXX XXXX reporting practices, which needs immediate investigation. 

If sufficient proof can not be provided to substantiate these late payments, I demand the immediate removal of the derogatory marks and request that the account status be corrected to reflect "" on time, never late, '' as this accurately represents the history of my payments. 

I have previously submitted multiple requests to the credit bureaus to address this issue, but to no avail. I am now seeking your assistance to rectify this error and ensure that my credit profile accurately reflects my payment history.

Disputes had been reported to TD Bank ; ref Merchant purchased products or services. Consumer paid for {$140.00} at hair salon on XX/XX/XXXX. Consumer advised Merchant the service was below expectations and resulted in damage to hair and color applied was backwards from the formula designed to the sections as needed. The Merchant was advised. Merchants tend not to refund consumers for botched services and tend to maximize their denial until the Bank places a dispute or reason for refunds. TD Bank applied a dispute claim to the account by provisional credit. The expectations by the consumer is for TD Bank send notifications to the merchant, ref a claim or charge back. The Merchant may or may not agree with the claim, although it's customary to have the merchant make good on poor service or lack of service. TD Bank claims that there was no error made on the purchase ; therefore, the consumer pays back the credit. The consumer is left with poor service and the bill. T D Bank explanations aren't in line with the process of investigating debit purchases, because those funds are provided by the consumer deposits. Instead of following through with sufficient investigation, TD Bank rather have VISA determination as to errors rather than disputes that will effect the consumer and the merchant goes free. 
Second, a new submission was entered by the consumer, when TD Bank requested documentation from the consumer, explaining the incident or concerns and was made to fax documents direct to TD Bank claims department after the first decision of denial. Consumer contends that TD Bank isn't managing disputes directly with XXXX, instead is relying on XXXX to make determination by only looking into errors or fraudulent charges on bank card. It's obvious, there's no remedy to canceled orders, canceled service, botched services, or returned purchases. That's an issue and an ongoing problem within the industry. XXXX doesn't want to charge back an item to the Merchant ; given its working relationship. The Consumer is considered the payer and my not have alternatives to resolutions through financial institutions. 
Third, TD Bank mismanagement of disputes effects the bottom line in the consumers daily balance. In this case, the consumer had positive balance on XX/XX/XXXX. After TD Bank reversed {$140.00} on the account it caused negative balance.

These are now multiple attempts to handle this matter privately. If these accounts keep getting verified by a faulty e-Oscar system when I know these accounts are erroneous and destroying my credit worthiness, I will in fact sue your agency for the maximum monetary damages that the FCRA allows.

Your agency has less than 30 days to respond with a fair reasonable re-investigation or I will have no choice but to seek legal action.

2024-12-07,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","In early XX/XX/XXXX received a letter from Freedom Mortgage indicating that an escrow refund check had been issued from my account, but not yet cashed. This was concerning to me as my escrow account should not be ahead at this time of year. 


I recalled that upon first purchasing my mortgage from XXXX, Freedom Mortgage did not properly implement my four-installment property tax payment plan. This plan is an election allowed by XXXX XXXX which sees the property tax from the previous year paid in four equal installments in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. The election to use this payment plan is present in my Initial Escrow Disclosure Agreement, and communicated to Freedom in document provided by XXXX ( see attached ). 


Freedom is not heed these documents when paying my property tax, doing so in a single lump sum and thus overdrawing my escrow account at the end of XXXX. However, when I contacted them concerning this issue, they were quick to resolve the problem to my satisfaction. This left me with the impression they were properly managing the account. 


That was not the case. 


Upon closer inspection I have found severe errors with the Escrow Analysis performed by Freedom Mortgage in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. 


In XXXX of XXXX  Freedom Mortgage issued an excess XXXX property tax payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX This was in addition to the erroneous lump sum amount they paid in XXXX in XXXX, evidently when they corrected my tax payment election they made it go into effect in XXXX not XXXX. Freedom contacted XXXX XXXX to request a refund, which was granted. 


Upon receiving the refund in XXXX of XXXX Freedom Mortgage conducted an Escrow analysis from the dates of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, they did not include the XXXX and XXXX payments in their calculations and planned my Escrow to pay half of the actual task burden. This led Freedom to simultaneously predict an account shortage while lowering the amount I was required to pay. As a result of this XXXX estimate Freedom determined that I needed a new minimum balance of {$750.00}. 


In XXXX of XXXX I met that minimum balance prompting Freedom to again perform an escrow analysis. This time the analysis indicated I was to pay a single {$3300.00} property tax payment in XXXX of XXXX. This was half the actual sum, paid in a single installment, six months after the first payment would be due in XXXX. 


As a result of this baffling analysis Freedom further reduced my monthly escrow payment and issued a reimbursement check to me for {$410.00} to address what they identified as an excess balance in my account. When this check was not cashed Freedom sent a second letter asking me to confirm its receipt, causing me to look deeper into the situation. 


I contacted Freedom Mortgage on XXXX and made them aware of their misadministration. I asked for the following actions to occur : 1 ) Cancel the reimbursement check and apply its funds to my escrow account. 

2 ) Restore my escrow payment to the balance found in their XX/XX/XXXX analysis ( XXXX monthly ), as this would cover upcoming predicted withdrawals in XXXX, if only they would tolerate a temporary negative balance in XXXX of that year. 

3 ) Give me a consistent point of contact regarding my escrow account, as the issues were ongoing. 


I also voluntarily increased my XX/XX/XXXX escrow payment to {$650.00}, for a total payment of {$2800.00}. Freedom was requiring a total payment of {$2500.00}, with {$370.00} going to escrow. 



Since contacting their customer service Freedom has not responded to me directly despite their automatic reply indicating they would do so within 7 business days. However, I am reasonably certain they did read my letter as they did take the following actions : 1 ) Cancel the reimbursement check and apply its funds to my escrow account. 

2 ) Perform escrow reanalysis and set my monthly payment starting in XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  to {$780.00} a month, for a total payment of {$2900.00}. 


This situation has lead me to believe that Freedom Mortgage has mismanaged my account due to incompetence, then failed to make a good faith effort to resolve the situation. I, as a lay person, should not be the backstop for their accounting and projection errors. It is ridiculous to see my escrow swing from a {$410.00} dollar reimbursement to requiring an additional {$410.00} a month without any surprise expenses. This sees extra money leaving my pocket to compensate for Freedom 's mismanagement.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Unfair and Punitive Practices by Bridgecrest Dear [ Consumer Protection Bureau ], I am writing to file a formal complaint against Bridgecrest, the finance company for XXXX, for engaging in practices that have caused significant and ongoing harm to my credit and financial standing. These actions appear to be punitive, unfair, and potentially in violation of consumer auto loan laws. 

In XX/XX/year>, Bridgecrest charged off my auto loan and repossessed the vehicle. Despite declaring the loan as a charge-off, they have continued to report the payments as late, which has severely defamed my credit profile and caused my credit score to plummet. This reporting has persisted for over three years, effectively destroying my ability to secure new financing. 

The following issues highlight the unfairness of Bridgecrests actions : Improper Reporting of Late Payments Post-Charge-Off : After charging off the loan, Bridgecrest continues to report payments as late, even though the debt was declared a charge-off. This practice is punitive and misleading, as a charge-off typically signifies that the creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible. 
Repossession of the Vehicle : Bridgecrest repossessed the vehicle, further indicating that the debt was no longer active. Despite this, they continue to report late payments, compounding the harm to my credit. 
Corporate Credit Write-Off : Bridgecrest likely obtained a corporate credit write-off for the charged-off loan, yet they continue to penalize me by reporting late payments, creating a scenario of triple jeopardy.

Prolonged Damage to Creditworthiness : For over three years, Bridgecrests actions have unjustly destroyed my credit score, making it nearly impossible for me to obtain new financing or rebuild my financial stability. 
These practices appear to violate principles of fairness and transparency in consumer lending and credit reporting. Additionally, they may conflict with regulations governing the proper handling of charged-off debts, repossessions, and credit reporting.

I respectfully request that the Consumer Protection Bureau investigate Bridgecrests practices and take appropriate action to ensure compliance with consumer protection laws. I also request that Bridgecrest be required to cease reporting late payments on the charged-off loan, correct my credit report, and provide restitution for the financial harm caused by their actions. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me at [ your contact information ] if additional information or documentation is required.",,Bridgecrest Acceptance Corporation,OH,43219,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11070692

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am submitting this formal dispute to request the deletion of the account with National Credit Adjust ( Account Number : XXXX ) from my credit report due to several discrepancies that violate my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Below are the discrepancies observed across the credit bureaus : Inconsistent Account Status Reporting : XXXX reports the account as "" Open '', while XXXX lists it as "" Closed '', and XXXX does not report the status. This inconsistency in account status violates the FCRA, as it provides conflicting information across credit reports and could confuse creditors or affect creditworthiness. Under FCRA Section 1681e ( b ), credit bureaus must ensure accurate and consistent reporting of account statuses. The discrepancies in account status across the bureaus could be misleading and result in incorrect credit assessments. 

Discrepancies in Payment Status and Past Due Information : XXXX lists the payment status as "" Late 120 Days '', while XXXX reports the account as "" Collection/Charge-off ''. XXXX also reports the account under the "" Collection/Charge-off '' status. The past due amounts reported by XXXX and XXXX also differ significantly, which could lead to an inaccurate picture of the accounts standing.Under FCRA Section 1681i, consumers are entitled to a report that accurately reflects their accounts. The differing descriptions of the payment status and past due balances across bureaus are inaccurate and violate this section of the FCRA. 

Inconsistent Reporting of Last Activity and Last Payment Dates : The last activity date is reported differently by the bureaus : XXXX lists it as XX/XX/XXXX, while XXXX lists it as XX/XX/XXXX. This inconsistency can affect the accurate aging of the account and may impact its removal date.Under FCRA Section 1681c, negative items must be removed after seven years from the date of last activity. The conflicting activity dates could result in the account remaining on my report longer than legally allowed, violating the FCRA. 

Discrepancy in Creditor Type and Account Description : The creditor type is reported differently across the bureaus : XXXX lists it as "" Factoring Companies '', while XXXX lists it as "" Bulk Purchase Finance ''. This inconsistency affects the accurate representation of the account. Under FCRA Section 1681i, consumers have the right to dispute and correct inaccurate information. The inconsistent reporting of the creditor type and account description is inaccurate and must be corrected. 

Lack of Dispute Status on All Reports : XXXX reports the account as disputed, but XXXX and XXXX do not reflect this dispute, despite the account being flagged as disputed.Under FCRA Section 1681i, a credit reporting agency must note when an account is disputed. The failure to indicate the dispute status on XXXX and XXXX violates the consumers right to a complete and accurate credit report. 

Given these discrepancies, I respectfully request that this account be deleted from my credit reports. The inaccuracies across the three credit bureaus violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the reporting of conflicting and erroneous information may be damaging my creditworthiness. 
The errors you are reporting on my account are permitting me from buying a home for my family. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.",,"National Credit Adjusters, LLC",FL,32812,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11068426

Despite three previous attempts to resolve these issues and over 90 days passing since my initial disputewell beyond the legally mandated 30-day period under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) these inaccuracies remain unresolved. The credit bureaus have not complied with federal and state laws requiring the removal and blocking of fraudulent accounts and inquiries. The following violations have been committed : Failure to Investigate and Resolve Disputes : FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) mandates that credit bureaus investigate and resolve disputes within 30 days. More than 90 days have elapsed since my initial dispute without resolution. Failure to Notify of Negative Information : Under 15 U.S.C. 1692g, creditors are required to notify consumers within five days of reporting a debt. I was never notified of these fraudulent accounts and inquiries. Failure to Ensure Maximum Accuracy : FCRA 607 ( b ) requires credit bureaus to ensure the maximum accuracy of the information they report. Discrepancies in balances, credit limits, and reporting dates indicate noncompliance. Failure to Remove and Block Fraudulent Accounts : Under FCRA 605B, upon receipt of evidence of identity theft, credit bureaus are required to remove and block fraudulent accounts and inquiries from credit reports. Despite providing substantial evidence, this has not occurred. Failure to Protect Consumer Data : Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( 15 U.S.C. 6801-6809 ), financial institutions and credit bureaus are required to safeguard consumer information. The presence of these fraudulent accounts demonstrates a failure to protect my data. Identity Theft Protections Ignored : The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ) criminalizes the unauthorized use of personal information. The fraudulent accounts and inaction by the bureaus violate my rights under this statute. State Law Violations : Under Florida Statute 817.568, identity theft is addressed as a criminal offense. The credit bureaus failure to act constitutes a violation of state protections. Fraudulent Accounts and Inquiries XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) ** : Incorrect delinquency reporting and credit limit inaccuracies and Reporting discrepancies in balances and dates, and balances exceeding credit limits. affinity plus fcu, republic bank ( Inquiry ID unavailable ) : Unauthorized inquiry recorded without my knowledge or consent. XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account # XXXX ) : Fraudulent account added without consent, failed to report for three months, and I was not notified five days prior to reporting, violating 15 U.S.C. 1692g. These accounts are fraudulent and were added to my credit report without my consent. I was not notified within five days of their reporting as required by 15 U.S.C. XXXX692g. Additionally, these accounts show discrepancies and lack proper validation. Requested Resolution Under FCRA 605B, I demand the immediate removal and permanent blocking of these accounts and inquiries from my credit report. Additionally, I request : A thorough investigation into the reporting failures and evidence of identity theft. Written confirmation of the removal and blocking of these accounts and inquiries. Implementation of fraud alerts and compliance with federal and state identity theft protections. The continued presence of these fraudulent accounts on my credit report has caused significant financial harm and emotional distress. If these issues are not resolved promptly, I will pursue legal action to protect my rights and escalate this matter to other regulatory authorities.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,33544,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11065064

Reporting claims that contravene legal standards is inappropriate, and I urge you to ensure the factual and correct reporting of all claims, in accordance with the Metro 2 reporting standard.

Furthermore, I kindly request the provision of tangible, verifiable evidence confirming the existence of the account and its permissible use, as mandated by the Metro 2 standard.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am writing to formally to file a complaint regarding charge off accounts that continue to be reported on my credit report, despite qualifying as income under IRS guidelines. The reporting of these accounts without the issuance of a 1099-C form is both misleading and a violation of my rights under federal law.

Background The accounts in question was charged off by the creditor which legally classifies the balance as canceled debt and, therefore taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) 6050P. According to this provision creditors are required to issue a 1099-C form for canceled debt exceeding {$600.00} allowing the debt to report it as income to the IRS, however I have not received a 1099-C for these accounts yet the creditor continues to report the balance to the credit reporting agencies as an active charge-off.

Legal Basis for Complaint Violation of IRC6050P The Internal Revenue mandate that creditors report canceled debt exceeding {$600.00} to the IRS and provide the debtor with a 1099-C form. The failure to issue this form not only prevents me from properly reporting my taxable income but also raises concerns about the creditors adherence to federal law.

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Creditors and furnishes are obligated to report accurate information to credit reporting agencies. Reporting a charge off account as delinquent without issuing the legally required 1099-C creates an inconsistency between the IRS classification and the creditors reporting practices, constituting inaccurate reporting under the FCRA.

Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) 1036 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : it is considered an unfair, deceptive or abusive act or practice ( UDAAP ) to report a charge off accounts as collectible or delinquent when it should be classified as income and documented through a 1099-C.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MI,48219,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11068430

I am XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX held to highest degree and regard of moral, civil, and ethical duties and dealings. I am gainfully employed and do not engage in low vibrational and distasteful acts such as what is being described below. 
Unsure of exact initial dates, but on or about XX/XX/year> I was contacted by an XXXX XXXX  fraud department representative regarding "" potential fraudulent activities '' that had taken place on my fathers bank account in which I am a co op due to him developing XXXX XXXX. I was informed that there were several checks that were deposited into his primary account ( which is where he received his SSI checks every month ) and the bank cleared but returned back as "" bad checks ''. This was my first time learning of these circumstances and I explained to the representative that the checks in fact had to be fraudulent because I did not recognize the names of the individuals that appeared on them. I also explained that I was only on the account because of my fathers XXXX XXXX and just in case we ever ran into problems such as him losing his card or inability to access his account, that my being on there would streamline this process of getting these issues situated, yet I've never as much passed a check through his account nor do I receive monetary gains through this account. The representative asked me to get in contact with my father because they were having no success at getting ahold of him because of phone connectivity issues. She did inform me at this time that they would proceed to close the account the first week of XXXX if there was no resolve. I would end up having the same issues with phone connectivity with my father as well and was unsuccessful at verifying things until the account was "" closed '' with XXXX XXXX. Once I was able to get to my father, he did inform me that his wallet was stolen ( which because of his XXXX XXXX, he kept his PIN number to his ATM card taped to the back of his card ). 
On or around XXXX, XXXX, I was attempting to be placed on my Husbands bank account with XXXX XXXX  when I was informed by the XXXX representative who ran a consumer banking report that I would not be able to be placed on his account due to me being flagged by "" XXXX '' for "" fraudulent check activity ''. I immediately requested my XXXX file and received my consumer report in the mail late XX/XX/year> which did state that I was reported for "" Suspected fraudulent activity '' involving an unpaid balance of {$2300.00}, owed to XXXX XXXX. After becoming aware of this, I made a trip up to XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX, Kansas where I was able to speak to a management team member by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX did provide me a copy of the bank statements showing that there had been a total of 3 checks that were apparently deposited at the ATM into my fathers account. I asked XXXX were any camera 's used to attempt to catch those responsible for the fraudulent activities to which her response was "" no ''. I asked XXXX if they tried to validate who wrote out the checks because the handwriting was not mines nor my fathers, to which XXXX responded "" no ''. Thirdly, I asked to see who endorsed the checks to check the signature and to my surprise, none of the three checks were ever endorsed. I asked XXXX why did the bank not take responsibility for allowing the checks to completely clear without an endorsement on the back to which her response was "" we were using the "" good faith '' rule to allow them to clear, as we have never had any issues with your fathers account in the past ''. XXXX refused to reverse their decision to "" hold me responsible '' for their bank allowing unendorsed, fraudulent checks to clear with every indication that these checks were not legit. 
Unfortunately, I have been denied access to being added to my husbands bank account with XXXX XXXX  due to me being added to XXXX, I have been denied an auto loan with my own XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and most recently learned that the fraudulent checks have been passed to a third party who have now flogged me that much more by adding a "" collections account '' to my credit report, which has lowered my score more than XXXX XXXX. Not to mention my aging father has suffered all the same. 
Please see all exhibits attached below including the checks deposited with no endorsement, my fathers one page bank statement showing the banks allowed the cashing of the fraudulent checks, and my personal XXXX XXXX file showing the suspicious activity alert and amount owed to XXXX XXXX  ( as well as the many credit pulls I had attempting to gain access to a new auto loan for which I was denied, this includes my personal credit union who I've been in excellent standing with for more than 13 years ).

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Upon reviewing my consumer reports, I discovered multiple late payment entries associated with my account that were inaccurately reported. As you are aware, Consumer Reporting Agencies bear a significant responsibility to ensure that all consumer information is reported with maximum accuracy. It is essential that the information reflected on my credit profile is both accurate and truthful. 

Specifically, I have never been late with any payments for my XXXX XXXX account ( Account # XXXX ). I respectfully request a thorough investigation into these erroneous late payment entries and demand that you provide verifiable proof, including statements, that demonstrate these payments were indeed late. To assist in this process, I can provide supporting documentation, including bank statements, payment notifications, timestamps from the XXXX payment app, and screenshots. 

Additionally, it is important to note that there have been substantial testimonies and reviews from numerous XXXX customers who have experienced similar issues regarding premature reporting of late payments. These reports indicate a pattern of errors where late payment flags are applied prematurely, negatively impacting credit scores. This further highlights the possibility of an internal issue with XXXX XXXX reporting practices, which needs immediate investigation. 

If sufficient proof can not be provided to substantiate these late payments, I demand the immediate removal of the derogatory marks and request that the account status be corrected to reflect "" on time, never late, '' as this accurately represents the history of my payments. 

I have previously submitted multiple requests to the credit bureaus to address this issue, but to no avail. I am now seeking your assistance to rectify this error and ensure that my credit profile accurately reflects my payment history.

Last month I requested an investigation because I felt the item was not being reported legally. Couple of days ago I received a letter stating that you have ceased investigation of my credit reports because, in your opinion, you believe that I have used a third-party credit repair agency. Not only do I believe this to be a stall tactic on your part to grant you an additional 30 days to comply with my original request, but I believe it to be a blatant violation of the FCRA. 
I have attached a copy of my government issued ID as well as mail showing proof of address. So, there shouldnt be no confusion or stall tactics on your end. I have maintained a careful record of my communications with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the FTC should you continue in your non-compliance. 
I request this under 15 U.S. Code 1692g - Validation of debts. If information is not provided or the false reporting isnt removed ; as in XXXX v. Trans Union Corp., XXXX. XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX XXXX ), you may be liable for your willful non-compliance. Credit reporting laws ensure that bureaus report only 100 % accurate credit information.

This information should not come as a form letter response. 

My initial dispute was detailed and directly related to the account in question. A template response will not be an acceptable response. If you can not supply ALL of the above information in a timely manner as detailed in several laws, including but not limited to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I must immediately demand the permanent removal of this item from my credit report. 

This erroneous entry is detrimental to my overall credit rating and has caused me severe financial and emotional distress.

Despite my initial request for the blocking of these fraudulent items, the following accounts remain on my credit report : XXXX XXXXXXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 7 ) - Description of Investigation : Pursuant to the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. To date, I have not received this required information. 

15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) - Verification Requirement : Per the FCRA, you are required by federal law to verify all accounts and public information through physical verification of the original signed consumer contract and/or judgment ( s ). Without such verification, there is a risk that erroneous or fraudulent information could be included in credit reports. Given the lack of adequate verification, I request the removal of this unauthorized public record information. 

Accuracy Compliance : Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in my credit report. If the information can not be verified, per 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), I request that you delete any unverifiable information. 

Failure to Investigate Accurately ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) : After submitting a dispute regarding inaccuracies on my credit report, I did not receive a thorough investigation within the mandated 30-day timeframe. The results of the investigation did not adequately address my concerns. 

According to 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, credit reporting agencies are required to block disputed information identified as resulting from identity theft within four business days of receiving a valid identity theft report. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 2 ) and 1681i ( 7 ), any unverifiable or inaccurate information must be removed from my credit report. 
Inadequate Compliance Procedures ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ) : The bureau has not demonstrated that it has implemented reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided on my report. I am requesting detailed information on the procedures used during the investigation. 

I demand that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that these fraudulent accounts are deleted from my credit report. I expect a prompt resolution to this issue and would appreciate any guidance you can provide regarding my rights in this matter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",UT,84096,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11070659

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To Whom It May Concern at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : I am filing this complaint against XXXX ( the creditor/furnisher ) and TransUnion ( the credit reporting agency ) regarding erratic and inconsistent reporting of my payment history for an account, which has caused significant financial and emotional harm. Despite no material changes to my account, the reported payment history has been altered multiple times in recent months, resulting in a substantial and unfair negative impact on my credit score. These changes reflect violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and a failure by both the creditor and the credit reporting agency to ensure the accuracy of the information furnished. 

Key Issues and Violations 1. Erratic and Inconsistent Payment History Updates : My payment history for the XXXX account has been updated and altered multiple times over a short period, as follows : XX/XX/XXXX : Payment history was changed, significantly altering late payment statuses for key months ( e.g., XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ). These changes reflected a positive correction to some entries. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Payment history was updated again, altering the reporting for prior months and resulting in further confusion about the accuracy of the reported data. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Payment history was altered once more, introducing new late payments for months that had previously been corrected, including 90 Days Late for XX/XX/XXXX and Payment After Charge-Off or Collection for XX/XX/XXXX. 
These repeated updates suggest gross negligence or intentional misreporting by XXXX or TransUnion. The FCRA requires both furnishers and credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate and consistent reporting under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

2. Failure to Ensure Accuracy of Information ( FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) : XXXX, as the furnisher, has repeatedly altered my payment history for the same account without explanation or evidence of accuracy. 
TransUnion, as the credit reporting agency, has failed to verify the accuracy of the information before including it in my credit report. 
Case Law : In XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ), the court ruled that credit reporting agencies and furnishers must ensure that the information they report is accurate and not misleading, even if technically accurate. 

XXXX. Negligent or Willful Misreporting ( FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) : The erratic changes to my payment history and the lack of proper investigation suggest either negligence or intentional efforts to maintain negative reporting. 
These actions have directly harmed my credit score, as demonstrated by the following : A XXXXpoint decrease on XX/XX/XXXX. 
A XXXXpoint decrease on XX/XX/XXXX, despite positive updates. 
A XXXXpoint decrease on XX/XX/XXXX, following a mix of positive and negative updates. 
This pattern of reporting changes reflects willful noncompliance, entitling me to statutory and actual damages for the harm caused. 

XXXX. Failure to Notify of Disputed Status ( FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( f ) ) : If XXXX or TransUnion claim these updates are related to an ongoing dispute or correction process, they have failed to notify me or mark the account as disputed on my credit report. This failure violates the FCRA and deprives me of the protections provided to consumers during disputes. 

XXXX. Emotional and Financial Harm : These inaccuracies and fluctuations have caused significant emotional distress and financial harm, including : Denial of credit applications due to the sudden and unexplained drops in my credit score. 
XXXX  and frustration caused by the lack of transparency and accountability from XXXX and TransUnion.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,30349,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11054438

XXXX XXXX claims that I missed a payment in XXXX of 2022, an allegation I firmly dispute, as I have maintained consistent and on-time payments throughout my relationship with them. Despite my efforts over the course of several years to dispute this inaccuracy, each investigation conducted by the credit bureaus has concluded that the reported late payment is "" verified, '' yet no tangible proof has ever been provided to substantiate this claim. 

Credit reporting agencies are obligated to ensure that all reported information is accurate and substantiated. This repeated failure to provide proof of the alleged late payment is a violation of my rights under the FCRA. XXXX XXXX has not been able to supply the necessary documentation to prove that a missed payment occurred, despite my numerous requests for verification, including the original statement and payment records from that time. 

This willful non-compliance by XXXX XXXX and the subsequent failure of the credit bureaus to address the issue properly have caused significant harm to my credit profile. As a result, I have been unjustly penalized for something that is not only incorrect but unverified. Such negligence has gone on for far too long and is a clear and blatant violation of my rights as a consumer. 

The continued reporting of this erroneous late payment without adequate proof is unacceptable and warrants immediate correction. If the disputed late payment can not be verified with concrete evidence, by law, it must be removed from my credit report.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Unfair and Punitive Practices by XXXX Dear [ Consumer Protection Bureau ], I am writing to file a formal complaint against XXXX, the finance company for XXXX, for engaging in practices that have caused significant and ongoing harm to my credit and financial standing. These actions appear to be punitive, unfair, and potentially in violation of consumer auto loan laws. 

In XX/XX/year>, XXXX charged off my auto loan and repossessed the vehicle. Despite declaring the loan as a charge-off, they have continued to report the payments as late, which has severely defamed my credit profile and caused my credit score to plummet. This reporting has persisted for over three years, effectively destroying my ability to secure new financing. 

The following issues highlight the unfairness of XXXX actions : Improper Reporting of Late Payments Post-Charge-Off : After charging off the loan, XXXX continues to report payments as late, even though the debt was declared a charge-off. This practice is punitive and misleading, as a charge-off typically signifies that the creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible. 
Repossession of the Vehicle : XXXX  repossessed the vehicle, further indicating that the debt was no longer active. Despite this, they continue to report late payments, compounding the harm to my credit. 
Corporate Credit Write-Off : XXXX likely obtained a corporate credit write-off for the charged-off loan, yet they continue to penalize me by reporting late payments, creating a scenario of triple jeopardy. 
Prolonged Damage to Creditworthiness : For over three years, XXXX  actions have unjustly destroyed my credit score, making it nearly impossible for me to obtain new financing or rebuild my financial stability. 
These practices appear to violate principles of fairness and transparency in consumer lending and credit reporting. Additionally, they may conflict with regulations governing the proper handling of charged-off debts, repossessions, and credit reporting.

I respectfully request that the Consumer Protection Bureau investigate XXXX practices and take appropriate action to ensure compliance with consumer protection laws. I also request that XXXX be required to cease reporting late payments on the charged-off loan, correct my credit report, and provide restitution for the financial harm caused by their actions. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX filed an identity theft report through the FTC, ( XXXX ) I also included a police report ( XXXX ) cover letter of dispute. Copy of identification, validation documentation of my legal address and a lease agreement without signatures per leesee request. 

I sent these documents through US mail to all 3 major credit bereaus, I also uploaded the documentation, police report and FTC report to all 3 bereaus. 

I've actually uploaded the supporting documentation multiple times to all of the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and Transunion throughout the month of XXXX. 

Since uploading the original documentation plus a dispute letter outlining my rights through the resource pages on the FTC website I have uploaded additional documentation validating my residence outside of the US from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

The accts that were not blocked or deleted were disputed originally and again on XX/XX/XXXX when I uploaded the lease agreement to all XXXX bereaus. 

XXXX and XXXX have platforms that provide multiple ways of disputing accts on my credit report and XXXX website is set up to navigate the user through a sales funnel for the paid membership that they offer users that require frequent credit reports and scores. 
Since beginning the repair journey I've logged over XXXX online and on chat plus phone calls to agents at Transunion. 
Nothing in that entire time has provided online access to my credit report. 
They continual share the same troubleshooting data that they have in script and that I have followed multiple times to get a copy of my report. 

I recently filed a dispute about the issues with Transunions timeliness and less than attentive concern to address the inquiries and fraudulent accts that are still on my credit report. My request was to get results or answers to my original dispute and identity theft case filed early XXXX. 
XXXX has told me that the platform they use has technical issues and that they will be resolved within XXXX to 3 days of time however this is not true, I can not access my credit report through the transunion platform. 

My request is that transunion remove the hard inquiries from my credit report as they are fraudulent and numerous, I also request that they block the additional accts that I disputed with documentation on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX with validating documentation that I included with all of my disputes. 

The complaint that I filed prevuousky through CFPB about Transunion barely touches the issues, delays and absence of action that Transunion has exampled throughout my effort to restore my good credit standing. The process has not been as stated in the Fair Credit Reporting Act and I want the hard inquiries and fraudulent accts blocked from my profile, and from potential credit opportunities. 
The response that I received after using this platform to express the problems that have been encountered do not hold this company accountable for the lack of action and the lack of progress despite following the FTC guidelines to restore my credit rating to pre identity theft condition. 
By allowing Transunion additional time after 30 days has passed is not providing me the consumer with anything that I wasn't already experiencing before addressing my issues to the CFPB. 

PLEASE make transunion address the identity theft accts on my report, remove all of the fraudulent inquiries so I can begin to build a healthy FICO score. The opportunity that having good credit provides has been stolen from me and time is of the essence. I own a company and can not provide the basics of ownership to the people that I employee. Getting funding of any amount to grow the company in order to hire more people is passing me by and the time, effort and energy that I have applied to just getting back to XXXX has been mountainous by any standard. 

My request is to not give this company any more of the most valuable commodity we have as humans, TIME. 
Please make this company do the right thing and remove the negative and fraudulent inquiries that plaque my credit profile immediately. 

Thank you so very much! 

With respect, consideration.

As per Section 1681i of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you are required to investigate and ensure the accuracy of the information reported on my credit file.

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 
YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown.

1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves. 
2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you.

Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes. 
Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ). 
I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes. 
The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am formally disputing the inaccurate and unverified entries on my credit report, which have significantly impacted my ability to obtain a mortgage to buy a home for my family. I have spent over five months attempting to resolve these discrepancies with the credit bureaus without success. Despite my numerous disputes, the credit reporting agencies have failed to verify these debts, provide documentation, or correct the errors, in violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other relevant laws. 

The following accounts are under dispute due to inaccuracies, missing or unverified documentation, and failure to correct or remove erroneous information : XXXX - FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ), which requires that a consumer can request the full details and verification of any debt reported. This account has not been validated by the creditor after multiple requests, violating my right to have accurate and verifiable information reported. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX FCRA Section 1681i, which mandates that if a consumer disputes an item, the credit reporting agency must investigate the dispute within a reasonable time. XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX failure to provide validation of the debt within the 30-day window violates this law. 
XXXX - FCRA Section 1681e ( b ) obligates the reporting agencies to maintain accurate and up-to-date records. The inaccurate reporting of this account continues despite my multiple attempts to request supporting documentation, leading to a violation of my right to fair and accurate credit reporting. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - FCRA Section 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) requires that any information provided must be thoroughly investigated and corrected if inaccurate. XXXX has not provided any adequate verification, and the account continues to be incorrectly reported. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  - FCRA Section 1681s-2 ( b ) outlines the responsibilities of furnishers of information to ensure accurate reporting. XXXX has not met these responsibilities, leaving inaccurate information on my report without verification. 
XXXX XXXX - Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Section 1692g requires validation of debts when disputed. I have not received adequate proof of the debt 's validity, and the reporting remains inaccurate across multiple bureaus. 
XXXX XXXX ( second listing ) - The repeated inaccurate reporting of this account violates both the FCRA and the FDCPA, as the account has not been properly validated or corrected after my disputes. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXFCRA Section 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate and resolve disputes in a timely manner. XXXX XXXX failure to provide verification of the debt or correct the report after multiple disputes constitutes a violation of this law. 
The presence of these inaccuracies is preventing me from obtaining a mortgage, which has a direct and negative impact on my ability to purchase a home for my family. I have made every effort to correct the errors, but the credit bureaus have failed to act within the parameters of the law, causing ongoing financial harm. 

Despite my repeated requests for validation and documentation, I have yet to receive any proof of these debts or their accurate reporting. As a result, the credit bureaus are violating my rights under the FCRA, FDCPA, and other consumer protection laws that ensure I have access to accurate credit information.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,32812,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11064111

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Failure to Delete Fraudulent Accounts from Credit Report violanting the law FCRA To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint against [ Credit Bureau Name ] for their failure to remove fraudulent accounts from my credit report as required by law.

I recently disputed several accounts on my credit report under the claim of identity theft, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2. I submitted a Police Report and an FTC identity theft report ( FTC Report Number : XXXX ) as evidence. The credit bureau acknowledged my dispute but has not complied with the requirements set forth by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
Despite my initial request for the blocking of these fraudulent items, the following accounts remain on my credit report : MT XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 7 ) - Description of Investigation : Pursuant to the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. To date, I have not received this required information.

15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) - Verification Requirement : Per the FCRA, you are required by federal law to verify all accounts and public information through physical verification of the original signed consumer contract and/or judgment ( s ). Without such verification, there is a risk that erroneous or fraudulent information could be included in credit reports. Given the lack of adequate verification, I request the removal of this unauthorized public record information.

Accuracy Compliance : Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in my credit report. If the information can not be verified, per 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), I request that you delete any unverifiable information.

Failure to Investigate Accurately ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) : After submitting a dispute regarding inaccuracies on my credit report, I did not receive a thorough investigation within the mandated 30-day timeframe. The results of the investigation did not adequately address my concerns.

According to 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, credit reporting agencies are required to block disputed information identified as resulting from identity theft within four business days of receiving a valid identity theft report. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 2 ) and 1681i ( 7 ), any unverifiable or inaccurate information must be removed from my credit report.

Inadequate Compliance Procedures ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ) : The bureau has not demonstrated that it has implemented reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided on my report. I am requesting detailed information on the procedures used during the investigation. 

I demand that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that these fraudulent accounts are deleted from my credit report. I expect a prompt resolution to this issue and would appreciate any guidance you can provide regarding my rights in this matter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",UT,84096,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11068594

Specifically : 1. An account reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) regarding a vehicle loan. 
2. An account reported by XXXX XXXX, which I have never had any dealings with. 

I have never opened an account with either XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, nor have I had any financial transactions or agreements with these institutions. The reporting of these accounts is false, unverifiable, and a violation of my consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681. 

As per the FCRA, you are required to ensure all information on my credit report is accurate and verifiable. Failure to do so constitutes a direct violation of federal law. These accounts can not be verified because they are fraudulent and do not belong to me. 

Demands : 1. Remove these accounts from my credit report immediately and ensure no further reporting from these institutions regarding these accounts.

2. Provide written confirmation of the removal of these accounts within three ( 3 ) days of receiving this letter. 
3. Cease reporting any negative or unauthorized information about me from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, or any related entities. 

Failure to act within the specified timeframe will leave me no choice but to escalate this matter by filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursuing legal remedies. 

I have attached a copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed accounts for your reference, along with the required proof of my identity, including a government-issued ID and utility bill.

After a 35 minute hold time a representative with an extremely heavy accent answered. I verified all of my information and then politely asked to speak with a US fluent English speaking representative. The representative rudely replied You will need to keep calling back until you get one. Of course I was flabbergasted and never spoken to in this manner by any representative from TransUnion in my previous contacts with them. I then advised the rep that thats not how its done and that her level of customer service in the way she speaks to people is extremely rude. The representative rudely replied well thats what were told to tell you. I then said its not what you say its how you say it and Im certain TransUnion didnt hire you to be rude. The representative at that point rudely disconnected the call by hanging up on me therefore preventing me from discussing my issue and further placing the fraud alert on my consumer report.

I recently disputed several accounts on my credit report under the claim of identity theft, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2. I submitted a Police Report and an FTC identity theft report ( FTC Report Number : XXXX ) as evidence. The credit bureau acknowledged my dispute but has not complied with the requirements set forth by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
Despite my initial request for the blocking of these fraudulent items, the following accounts remain on my credit report : XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 7 ) - Description of Investigation : Pursuant to the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. To date, I have not received this required information. 

15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) - Verification Requirement : Per the FCRA, you are required by federal law to verify all accounts and public information through physical verification of the original signed consumer contract and/or judgment ( s ). Without such verification, there is a risk that erroneous or fraudulent information could be included in credit reports. Given the lack of adequate verification, I request the removal of this unauthorized public record information. 

Accuracy Compliance : Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in my credit report. If the information can not be verified, per 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), I request that you delete any unverifiable information. 

Failure to Investigate Accurately ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) : After submitting a dispute regarding inaccuracies on my credit report, I did not receive a thorough investigation within the mandated 30-day timeframe. The results of the investigation did not adequately address my concerns. 

According to 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, credit reporting agencies are required to block disputed information identified as resulting from identity theft within four business days of receiving a valid identity theft report. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 2 ) and 1681i ( 7 ), any unverifiable or inaccurate information must be removed from my credit report. 
Inadequate Compliance Procedures ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ) : The bureau has not demonstrated that it has implemented reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided on my report. I am requesting detailed information on the procedures used during the investigation. 

I demand that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that these fraudulent accounts are deleted from my credit report.

Despite prior attempts to resolve these issues, both parties have failed to take corrective action, leading to persistent inaccuracies in my credit report. I request the CFPBs immediate intervention to enforce compliance and address these systemic failures.

Key Violations and Issues 1. Equifaxs Failure to Ensure Accuracy ( 1681e ( b ) ) : The FCRA requires credit reporting agencies to ensure the accuracy of information in consumer reports : FCRA 1681e ( b ) : Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report, it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 
Equifax has failed to meet this standard, as shown by the following inaccuracies in my XXXX XXXX XXXX account : XX/XX/XXXX : Reported alternately as 90 Days Late and Current.

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to Furnish Accurate Data ( XXXX ) : As a furnisher of information, XXXX XXXX XXXX is obligated to provide accurate data and investigate disputes : FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) : A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

FCRA 1681s-2 ( b ) : After receiving notice pursuant to section 611 ( a ) ( 2 ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681i ] of a dispute with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information provided by a person to a consumer reporting agency, the person shall conduct an investigation with respect to the disputed information. 
XXXX has failed to meet these obligations by furnishing incorrect information and neglecting to verify or correct these inaccuracies after disputes.

3. Failure to Reinvestigate and Correct Errors ( 1681i ) : Both Equifax and XXXX have failed to conduct proper investigations of disputes : FCRA 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer, and the consumer notifies the agency the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate. 
Neither Equifax nor XXXX has adequately reinvestigated my disputes or ensured the permanent correction of errors. 
4. Permissible Purpose ( 1681b ) : The FCRA limits the purposes for which consumer information may be used : FCRA 1681b ( a ) : A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 1 ) In response to the order of a court ( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer ( 3 ) To a person which it has reason to believe intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction.

The ongoing reporting of erroneous data suggests a misuse of permissible purposes, as the information is inaccurate and harmful rather than reflecting legitimate credit behavior. 
5. Harm Caused by Inaccuracies : The inaccuracies in my credit report have caused significant harm, including : Credit score fluctuations : XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX decrease. 
XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX decrease. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Slight recovery after partial corrections, though unresolved issues persist.

I am XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX held to highest degree and regard of moral, civil, and ethical duties and dealings. I am gainfully employed and do not engage in low vibrational and distasteful acts such as what is being described below. 
Unsure of exact initial dates, but on or about XX/XX/year> I was contacted by an Arvest bank fraud department representative regarding "" potential fraudulent activities '' that had taken place on my fathers bank account in which I am a co op due to him developing XXXX XXXX. I was informed that there were several checks that were deposited into his primary account ( which is where he received his SSI checks every month ) and the bank cleared but returned back as "" bad checks ''. This was my first time learning of these circumstances and I explained to the representative that the checks in fact had to be fraudulent because I did not recognize the names of the individuals that appeared on them. I also explained that I was only on the account because of my fathers failing cognition and just in case we ever ran into problems such as him losing his card or inability to access his account, that my being on there would streamline this process of getting these issues situated, yet I've never as much passed a check through his account nor do I receive monetary gains through this account. The representative asked me to get in contact with my father because they were having no success at getting ahold of him because of phone connectivity issues. She did inform me at this time that they would proceed to close the account the first week of XXXX if there was no resolve. I would end up having the same issues with phone connectivity with my father as well and was unsuccessful at verifying things until the account was "" closed '' with Arvest Bank. Once I was able to get to my father, he did inform me that his wallet was stolen ( which because of his XXXX XXXX he kept his PIN number to his ATM card taped to the back of his card ). 
On or around XXXX, XXXX, I was attempting to be placed on my Husbands bank account with XXXX XXXX  when I was informed by the XXXX representative who ran a consumer banking report that I would not be able to be placed on his account due to me being flagged by "" XXXX '' for "" fraudulent check activity ''. I immediately requested my XXXX file and received my consumer report in the mail late XX/XX/year> which did state that I was reported for "" Suspected fraudulent activity '' involving an unpaid balance of {$2300.00}, owed to XXXX XXXX. After becoming aware of this, I made a trip up to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Kansas where I was able to speak to a management team member by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX did provide me a copy of the bank statements showing that there had been a total of 3 checks that were apparently deposited at the ATM into my fathers account. I asked XXXX were any camera 's used to attempt to catch those responsible for the fraudulent activities to which her response was "" no ''. I asked XXXX if they tried to validate who wrote out the checks because the handwriting was not mines nor my fathers, to which XXXX responded "" no ''. Thirdly, I asked to see who endorsed the checks to check the signature and to my surprise, none of the three checks were ever endorsed. I asked XXXX why did the bank not take responsibility for allowing the checks to completely clear without an endorsement on the back to which her response was "" we were using the "" good faith '' rule to allow them to clear, as we have never had any issues with your fathers account in the past ''. XXXX refused to reverse their decision to "" hold me responsible '' for their bank allowing unendorsed, fraudulent checks to clear with every indication that these checks were not legit. 
Unfortunately, I have been denied access to being added to my husbands bank account with XXXX XXXX  due to me being added to XXXX, I have been denied an auto loan with my own XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and most recently learned that the fraudulent checks have been passed to a third party who have now flogged me that much more by adding a "" collections account '' to my credit report, which has lowered my score more than XXXX XXXX. Not to mention my aging father has suffered all the same. 
Please see all exhibits attached below including the checks deposited with no endorsement, my fathers one page bank statement showing the banks allowed the cashing of the fraudulent checks, and my personal XXXX XXXX file showing the suspicious activity alert and amount owed to XXXX XXXX ( as well as the many credit pulls I had attempting to gain access to a new auto loan for which I was denied, this includes my personal credit union who I've been in excellent standing with for more than 13 years ).

They have never sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided.

This is unfair, illegal, fraudulent, and not equitable to me as a consumer!

1. Personal Information Challenge : I challenge the following personal information : As per 15 U.S Code 1681 a ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy, I regard my hard inquiry and account information as private. Your reporting of accounts that are not mine is a breach of my privacy rights.

2. FDCPA 807 - Misleading False Reporting : The information you have reported wrongly suggests to future creditors that I initiated all these inquiries and accounts. In reality, these were actions of a scammer. This misrepresentation on your part violates the FCRA laws for fairness.

3. 15 USC 1681n Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : You've accepted and reported credit information about me without proper verification, making you potentially liable for up to {$1000.00} per violation.

4. 18 U.S. Code 1028A - Aggravated Identity Theft : Sharing my information without my prior consent makes you criminally liable for aggravated identity theft, punishable for up to 2 years.

6. FDCPA 8012 - Furnishing Deceptive Forms : You reported inquiries and accounts without proper validation, contravening the GAAP requirements.

7. Reporting Discrepancies : Your reporting indicates I owe a debt without displaying any negative balance. This is misleading.

8. 15 U.S. Code 1692f Unfair Practices : Your conduct suggests several violations, including unauthorized collection of amounts and the use of misleading symbols on mailed communication.

9. 15 U.S. Code 1602 - Definitions and Rules of Construction : The information you provided relating to me is inaccurate, violating 15 USC 1681s-2.

10. Claims of Harassment and Abuse : Per FDCPA 806, I feel harassed and abused due to the continuous reporting of inaccurate items and unwarranted communications from creditors.

11. Identity Theft and Unauthorized Sharing : My information was illegally shared and used without my genuine consent, resulting in a case of identity theft as defined by Section 1581a ( 3 ).

14. Requests Pertaining to Debts : I am the original creditor, and only I can validate any debts. The debts reported by you are unvalidated and must be removed.

15. 15 U.S. Code 1681b Permissible Purposes of Consumer Reports : You have acted without my written consent, which equates to identity theft.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681g, I have the right to demand that you disclose to me all the documents that you have recorded and retained in your file at the time of the request concerning the accounts that you are reporting on my credit report.

****IMPORTANT **** PLEASE don't respond to my request by saying that these accounts have been verified by the information provider. SEND ME COPIES OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU HAVE RETAINED IN YOUR FILES THAT YOUR COMPANY USED TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF THESE DISPUTED ACCOUNTS. I demand that the following account be verified or removed immediately : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Dispute Reason : According to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the agent is in breach of 15 U.S.C. 1692e, which prevents the dissemination of false or misleading information, and 15 U.S.C. 1692j, which bars the provision of deceptive forms. Furthermore, as stipulated by 15 U.S.C. 1692g, I should have received a written notification regarding this issue at least five days prior, but this was not done. Being the only original creditor, I hold the sole right to authenticate this debt. Therefore, I HEREBY DECLARE THAT I DO NOT RECOGNIZE THIS DEBT.

Dispute Instruction : According to the provisions of 15 USC 1692g, 15 USC 1681b, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have not granted any permission for your agency to list this public record on my credit report. For all accounts mentioned above, I require verification and validation of every detail including notations, dates, and balances, irrespective of their reported status. I also request evidence of your verification method, and the specific details that correspond with mine. Absent precise matches, the account must be removed immediately in accordance with the FCRA.

This account has always been current, and proof should be available demonstrating that any statements were mailed to me at least 21 days prior to any due payment. As per FCRA Sections 605, 609, and 623, I request this evidence. Additionally, as this is listed as a collection account, the collecting party must authenticate the survivability of this debt, their ownership of the debt, their collection rights, and that all their details align with the original creditor. Without such proof, the entry must be deleted. Finally, as outlined in 15 USC 1681b related to the permissible purposes of consumer reports : it is expressly articulated that a consumer reporting agency may provide a report in line with the written instructions of the associated consumer. The record of this account is erroneous ; I have never defaulted on my payments.

Kindly update the status to reflect accurate, timely payments.

I know that as the consumer, I HOLD ALL THE POWER. As a ( MO ) 281 SW715, 719, I presume that no proof of the alleged debt, nor therefore any such debt, in fact, exists. As a consumer XXXX XXXX and the one with ALL THE POWER, these inaccurate accounts on this letter must be deleted immediately AS IN ASAP, or I will seek monetary damages in small claims court in my city and state.

Furthermore, I certify that this request to block was made NOT in error, and My request to block information was NOT based on a material misrepresentation. I DID NOT knowingly obtain or should have known that I obtained possession of goods, services, or monies as a result of one or more of the transactions that I am seeking to block.

Additionally, I request that you send me a validation of all debts according to GAAP. If you can not do that, then you must remove them.

Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) 1 ( a ), I am demanding that your agency perform a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the status of the disputed information. 
Pursuant to 15 USC 1681e ( b ) please complete this inaccurate account or delete it from my consumer reports.

The Law Cleary States : ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation required ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 

I DO NOT consent to any E-OSCAR verification as this method is not reliable or lawful, according to the standards set for by the FCRA. 

I am requesting that you validate the following items non-electronically, by performing a reasonable and FAIR re-investigation : Please provide the following details of the methods by which you verified these accounts : a. Identity and position of the representative contacted? 
b. Date, duration, and substance of the conversation?

c. Contact details utilized?

d. Identity, position, and tenure of your company 's employees involved?

e. Details of formal training imparted to said employee?

f. Copies of all written correspondence?

Your agency also seems to be in violation of non-compliance and negligent non-compliance with being in direct violation or the following laws : 15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance ( a ) In general Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) ( A ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than {$100.00} and not more than {$1000.00} ; or ( B ) in the case of liability of a natural person for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose, actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater ; ( 2 ) such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow ; and ( 3 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.

( b ) Civil liability for knowing noncompliance Any person who obtains a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose shall be liable to the consumer reporting agency for actual damages sustained by the consumer reporting agency or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater.

These are now multiple attempts to handle this matter privately. If these accounts keep getting verified by a faulty e-Oscar system when I know these accounts are erroneous and destroying my credit worthiness, I will in fact sue your agency for the maximum monetary damages that the FCRA allows.

Provide a detailed description of the investigation process per 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( XXXX ). 
Update the payment status for XX/XX/XXXX to reflect "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late. '' If you are unable to provide verifiable proof of the late payment, correct the reporting immediately to align with my accurate payment history.

It is important to note that this dispute was not sent by an unauthorized third party or \ '' XXXX XXXX '' I am writing to address the ongoing violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) that have yet to be resolved, despite my previous dispute letters. The violations are as follows : FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : You continue to report fraudulent accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me, thereby infringing upon my privacy rights. As I have reiterated multiple times, I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. It is imperative that you cease sharing my hard inquiries and account information on my credit report.

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : Despite my previous disputes, you persist in reporting false information that suggests I applied for multiple inquiries and accounts. These actions were the result of a scammer\ 's actions, and your continued unverified reporting is a direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and its fairness requirements.

FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Your failure to verify the accuracy of the credit information you have accepted demonstrates willful noncompliance. I remind you that such noncompliance is subject to civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation.

FCRA Section 605B - Aggravated Identity Theft : Continuing to share my personal information with numerous creditors without obtaining my consent is a criminal act of aggravated identity theft. I reiterate that this offense carries a penalty of up to 2 years of imprisonment.

FCRA Section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information : You have yet to fulfill your obligation to disclose my right to opt out of sharing my personal information. This omission is deceptive and a direct violation of my consumer rights.

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Furnishing Deceptive Forms : Despite my previous dispute efforts, you persist in furnishing inaccurate inquiries and accounts without proper validation, potentially violating Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).

Reporting such deceptive information is unacceptable.

In addition to the aforementioned violations, I remind you of the previous violations outlined in my earlier dispute letters, including the violation of Debt Collection Practices Act, Identity Theft Laws, Acquiring Location Information Regulations, Timely Payments Regulations, Finance Charge Determination, and Credit Report Permissible Purposes. These violations require your immediate attention and resolution.

I want to inform you that I have retained the services of a consumer rights attorney to assist me in addressing these violations. I have also lodged complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the Attorney General\ 's Office regarding your noncompliance with the FCRA XXXX I am actively pursuing all available avenues to ensure my rights are protected. 
Once again, I demand that you take immediate action to address these violations and fulfill the following requests : XXXX XXXX - XXXX - Under 15 USC 1666b, this late payment entry is a violation. I have been incorrectly billed. - Please update the status of this account to "" paid on time. '' XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX inquiry. - DELETE!!!

Remove all fraudulent and inaccurate accounts from my credit report. 
Block any information resulting from identity theft, as required by the FCRA. 
I can not stress enough the urgency of this matter. Your persistent noncompliance with my requests and failure to rectify these violations leave me with no choice but to pursue the legal remedies available under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

I expect a prompt response outlining a definitive plan of action from you. Your cooperation in rectifying these issues is imperative and greatly appreciated.

After reviewing my credit report, I identified a 30-day late payment erroneously reported for XX/XX/XXXX on my ALLY FINCL account. This late payment is inaccurate, as I have always made timely payments on this account. 
Account Details Account Number : XXXX High Balance : {$32000.00} Last Verified : XX/XX/XXXX Date of Last Activity : XX/XX/XXXX Date Reported : XX/XX/XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance Owed : {$0.00} Closed Date : XX/XX/XXXX Account Rating : Closed Account Description : Joint account Dispute Status : Account not disputed Creditor Type : Finance, personal Account Status : Closed Payment Status : 30 days past due Payment Amount : {$0.00} Last Payment : XX/XX/XXXX Term Length : 75 months Past Due Amount : {$0.00} Account Type : Installment account Payment Frequency : Monthly Credit Limit : {$0.00} Discrepancies in Payment History According to the TransUnion-reported payment history, a 30-day late payment is listed for XX/XX/XXXX. This late payment is inaccurate, as my payment records indicate that all payments were made on time. 

Reference to Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violations Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), credit reporting agencies are obligated to ensure the information they report is accurate and verifiable. Specifically : 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) : My consumer report should not contain inaccurate or unverifiable information related to transactions or experiences between me and the creditor.

15 USC 1666 ( b ) : Creditors must adopt reasonable procedures to ensure timely mailing of statements and accurate reporting of payments.

15 USC 1637 ( b ) : All periodic statements must contain complete and accurate information about payment due dates and amounts.

Requested Action I kindly request that TransUnion : Conduct a thorough investigation into the accuracy of the reported late payment.

Provide a detailed description of the investigation process per 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 7 ).

Update the payment status for July 2019 to reflect "" Paid As Agreed, Never Late. '' If you are unable to provide verifiable proof of the late payment, correct the reporting immediately to align with my accurate payment history.

Supporting Evidence I have attached the following documents to support my dispute : A copy of my credit report highlighting the inaccurate entry.

Nature of the Complaint Inaccurate Reporting : The late payment reported for XX/XX/XXXX is incorrect. I have consistently made all payments on time, as this account has been enrolled in autopay.

This reporting may also violate the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), as it misrepresents my payment obligations.

2024-12-07,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"This is in regard to complaint XXXX. I am submitting this as a follow-up to my previous complaint filed on XX/XX/XXXX, which was closed on XX/XX/XXXX with a response from Sallie Mae . I respectfully disagree with the response they provided.

Their response states : "" Our records reflect that we reviewed and addressed substantially identical concerns via the CFPB. Please reference CFPB case numbers XXXX and XXXX for our previous responses. As your most recent complaint provides no new or additional information, our position remains unchanged, and we consider this matter to be closed. If you need further assistance, please call our Customer Service Contact Center at XXXX. '' While they acknowledge addressing my concerns in previous complaints, they claim that my most recent complaint provides no new or additional information. I believe this statement overlooks critical updates I provided. Specifically, in my most recent complaint, I included the following information : "" Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been actively working with XXXX representatives to pursue assistance. My XXXX  doctor initially assured me that my condition would qualify me for XXXX. I have since submitted all requested documentation, and most recently met with a XXXX  as directed by the XXXX office. While this XXXX  confirmed that my diagnoses align with XXXX requirements, he informed me that, due to my age, it would likely be challenging to secure approvala policy that I believe is discriminatory. My age should not hinder access to XXXX support when my health conditions, including XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), have rendered me unable to work. '' This is new and relevant information that Sallie Mae was not aware of during the previous complaints. For context, I did not receive my diagnoses of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, a month after I filed my second complaint. Furthermore, I was not even aware of my appointment with the XXXX  when I filed my second complaint on XX/XX/XXXX. Thus, I find it concerning that Sallie Mae dismissed this most recent complaint as containing no new information. This response indicates that my complaint was not given the appropriate consideration, especially regarding the addition of these important details. 

For reference, the previous complaint timelines are as follows : XXXX filed on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX filed on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ( most recent ) filed on XX/XX/XXXX Timeline of relevant medical events : XX/XX/XXXX : First appointment with a XXXX  in XXXX, AR XX/XX/XXXX : Underwent additional testing for XXXX  XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : Received diagnoses of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX board request, confirming that my conditions qualify for XXXX but that my age could pose a challenge to approval Given this timeline, I am perplexed by Sallie Maes assertion that no new information was provided. The diagnoses and the XXXX  evaluation were not available at the time of the prior complaints, and I had not yet shared that I was in contact with the XXXX board and had met with a XXXX. 

I have been trying to resolve this loan issue since XX/XX/XXXX. I took out the loan based on misleading information provided by the course instructor of the "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  '' program, XXXX XXXX. She led me to believe that the course could be completed within XXXX months, without informing me that it required XXXX  XXXX  and was a two-year program. This was not feasible for me due to my cognitive limitations caused by XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). Had I known the true nature of the course, I would not have taken out the loan. 

Sallie Mae has stated they are willing to assist. During an earlier conversation with a representative, I was encouraged to fill out their total XXXX form, with the understanding that my case would likely be resolved favorably. However, despite submitting the form twice with the required documentation, no meaningful resolution has been reached. Sallie Mae is fully aware of my financial and medical situationsince XX/XX/XXXX ( when I was fired from my last job ), I have been unable to work due to my health and have no source of income, aside from the limited financial assistance I receive from my retired parents ( {$500.00} every XXXX months ). 

It is increasingly difficult to rely on my parents, as they are already stretched thin with their own retirement and social security. It is not fair to expect them to contribute further to my loan repayment when the money they provide is intended solely for basic living expenses. 

Despite my efforts for years to find work-from-home opportunities, I believed I had finally found a viable option in the Court Reporting and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. However, the course was misrepresented, and I soon realized it was not a feasible path for me due to its demands. Since then, I have continued my search for suitable work-from-home positions, but I have not had any success. 

I have absolutely no way to pay off this loan. I am unable to apply for repayment programs, and I have no support from friends or family to help with the payments. Despite my best efforts to resolve this situation, Sallie Mae seems uninterested in addressing my needs or offering the assistance I require. This lack of concern for my position only adds to the difficulty of my situation, as I continue to face overwhelming financial and health challenges. 

I respectfully ask that Sallie Mae revisit this issue with a greater level of attention to the new information I have provided, and that they reconsider their position given the serious medical, financial, and personal challenges I am currently facing.

So I set up auto pay for my CC and sometimes it works and alot it does not. 

So today I talked to XXXX a supervisor who flat out lied about my Financials on the phone with me. He states that XXXX I had no balance due. My issue with that is I called specifically for the {$1200.00} that was not deducted. 

So XX/XX/XXXX it should been auto paid. But was not so I called about the XXXX and was told it would be auto paid on XX/XX/XXXX. So I paid it XX/XX/XXXX to get my limit back up. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the auto pay went thru but shows I still have a balance of {$89.00}. 

I want to know why the auto pay worked XXXX but not XXXX. If I did not check my account then it would have lapsed in the XXXX payment and then they would have charged me interest. 

And now it says I still owe {$89.00} for XXXX makes it look they took partial payment so they could charge me interest on the balance they left",,"HUNTINGTON NATIONAL BANK, THE",MI,48066,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11069994

After performing a re-investigation upon my credit file for accounts XXXX XXXX XXXX pursuant to 15 USC 1681ia1a, your company failed to follow proper procedures in regard to correspondence to me the consumer, in the handling of the reinvestigation. As clearly outlined within, 15 USC 1681i ( 7 ) ; 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy Subchapter 7 states the following ; ( 7 ) Description of reinvestigation procedure A consumer reporting agency shall provide to a consumer a detailed description referred to in paragraph ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) by not later than 15 days after receiving a request from the consumer for that description. Further outlined within 15 USC ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) ; ( 6 ) Notice of results of reinvestigation ( A ) In general A consumer reporting agency shall provide written notice to a consumer of the results of a reinvestigation under this subsection not later than XXXX business days after the completion of the reinvestigation, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by other means available to the agency. ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by the consumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to the consumer by the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher, if reasonably available. The correspondence mentioned above was NEVER made to me and therefore, your company is in direct violation of the FCRA and is now liable for monetary damages detailed within 15 USC 1681n and 15 USC 1681o. Not only was a proper reinvestigation not performed as the derogatory account mentioned is erroneous to begin with, your agency failed to follow the FCRAs clear rules in the handling of correspondence to me in association with the account in question.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2.

This amount was an amount that I have not received a receipt for nor authorized for. This amount was an unauthorized charge on my Apple Card. I created a dispute with Goldman and Sachs Co for this since I never approached that amount and didnt make the payment. 

The first time I created the dispute I provided them the past payments I made to the company showing them that the receipts I had were matching the prior payments. However, the recent payments totaling to {$10000.00} was never something I authorized and didnt have a receipt for. Yet my dispute was denied and the merchant was found in the right. 

I disputed again and asked them how can they find the merchant in the right, they dont even have a receipt for this transaction, it is fraudulent. They said that there was no response from the merchant so they sided with the merchant even though I provided them again a proof of trying to reach out to the merchant and asking them why I was charged those amounts and responding to the bank. They never responses to the bank and the bank still sided with them. 

I did a third dispute and it was still denied and I called them again asking why it keeps getting denied and that I literally have no idea how I can prove them that I didnt authorize something and that they keep siding with the merchant even though they dont even get any response from them. 

I asked them to dispute again, for the forth time, and asked them to request from the fraud department for a reason why the disputes are being denied. What proof do they have from the merchant to deny my dispute because I am so sure they had no contact from the merchant. And of course I never received anything upon this request. In fact, this time around, they closed my account with no good explanation. The dispute is still open and I have no idea if it will be in my favor or not. 

Every time I asked the representative for a contact to reach out to their fraud department and every time I was told that the fraud department has no internal number to reach out to that even they can not get in touch with them.

Pursuant to 15 USC 1681e ( b ) please complete this inaccurate account or delete it from my consumer reports.

The Law Cleary States : ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation required ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

I DO NOT consent to any E-OSCAR verification as this method is not reliable or lawful, according to the standards set for by the FCRA.

I am requesting that you validate the following items non-electronically, by performing a reasonable and FAIR re-investigation : Please provide the following details of the methods by which you verified these accounts : a. Identity and position of the representative contacted?

b. Date, duration, and substance of the conversation?

c. Contact details utilized?

d. Identity, position, and tenure of your company 's employees involved?

e. Details of formal training imparted to said employee?

f. Copies of all written correspondence?

Your agency also seems to be in violation of non-compliance and negligent non-compliance with being in direct violation or the following laws : 15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance ( a ) In general Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) ( A ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than {$100.00} and not more than {$1000.00} ; or ( B ) in the case of liability of a natural person for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose, actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater ; ( 2 ) such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow ; and ( 3 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.

( b ) Civil liability for knowing noncompliance Any person who obtains a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose shall be liable to the consumer reporting agency for actual damages sustained by the consumer reporting agency or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater.

These are now multiple attempts to handle this matter privately. If these accounts keep getting verified by a faulty e-Oscar system when I know these accounts are erroneous and destroying my credit worthiness, I will in fact sue your agency for the maximum monetary damages that the FCRA allows.

Your agency has less than 30 days to respond with a fair reasonable re-investigation or I will have no choice but to seek legal action.

To all XXXX criminally negligent 'credit reporting bureaus ', i am a XXXX, homeless XXXX  with no valid state issued I.D . struggling at present with multiple agencies within this bureaucratic nightmare of government and so called 'consumer protection ' agencies in which i am now fighting desperately for benefits, entitlements and protection of my most basic consumer and human Rights. i would appreciate a little assistance with regard to this matter of my credit being stolen from i back in XXXX. 

Hence, i am writing to offer you what i have to offer you in terms of identification. i sincerely hope that my doing so will help your organizations to comply with the law, although i fail to comprehend why i am placed at such an inconvenience to simply require you to comply with the most basic of consumer protection laws. i feel violated by this process and am feeling extremely unsafe as well as discriminated against by this disgusting process. 

All my I.D . credentials have been lost in the now close to XXXX moves i have made since being rendered homeless by the draconian public health policies of the 'State of New Mexico XXXX during COVID ; save my Authenticated Birth Certificate ( enclosed ). 

i am patiently waiting on word from the U.S. State Department regarding my passport. i have provided for you that which i am able to assist you in confirming my identity. 

NOTE : the Duly Authorized Executed Durable Power of Attorney ( enclosed ) evidences that an agent of the State of Arizona on stated date, examined my credentials ( the same i am sharing with you all now ) and has certified to her satisfaction that i am the man whom i declare that i am. 

i am asking you this one last time to simply comply with the Consumer Protection Law FCRA 605 ( b ), cease with your pathetic attempts to shirk that responsibility by stating 'policies ' that have nothing to do with my basic consumer Rights and block the referenced accounts immediately. i cant even begin to express how difficult it was for i to provide this information to you. i am without a vehicle, no income at the moment and am living off grid in the mountains of the XXXX XXXX XXXX at present. 

i am hoping that yall can work with i and help i to straighten this credit file out.

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 
YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown.

1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you.

Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes. 
The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

2024-12-07,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction problem,,"Hello. My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Here I want to provide an explanation about the things happened as I open up a new case against Robinhood.

I recently opened a new account at Robinhood ( https : //robinhood.com/ ) because I was considering starting investment for the first time. I transferred the fund from my 2 bank accounts, but soon encountered with a serious problem. Let me explain what happened in chronological order. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated transfer of {$3000.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  of XXXX XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated transfer of {$1.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  of XXXX XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated transfer of {$46000.00} from my XXXX savings account ending XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated transfer of additional {$2000.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  of XXXX XXXX. ( This one is still pending as of XX/XX/XXXX, even though XXXX  XXXX is saying it already went through on their end ) As of XX/XX/XXXX, total of {$49000.00} of fund was transferred to my Robinhood account from my two bank accounts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, transfer process of the first three ( XXXX + XXXX + XXXX ) was completed and the money came into my Robinhood account. Upon confirmation, I initiated transfer of this fund back to my bank accounts, but Robinhood system did not let this request go through despite of several attempts. The reason why I initiated transfer of fund back to my bank accounts was because while waiting for the completion of the transfer to Robinhood, which is between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I changed my mind and decided to not go ahead with investment at Robinhood. I did try to cancel transfer process but it did not let me, so I had to wait until XX/XX/XXXX. 

When the transfer process was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, Robinhood system clearly stated that the money was now in my cash account in Robinhood and is ready to be used for investment and also that the transfer back to the bank account was possible. Subsequently I tried to transfer the balance back to my bank accounts from which I originally transferred the fund, but it continuously showed an error message saying that the request was denied because the money has to be transferred to the original bank account from which the fund was deposited and that it was not possible to transfer the fund to another bank.

This message did not make sense at all because all of the bank statements that were listed on my Robinhood account to which I tried to transfer the money back were exactly the same bank accounts I deposited the money from in the first place on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. I was very shocked looking at this happening, so I went to the Robinhood support chat ( which is the only means to communicate with Robinhood as the phone number they had did not reach to any real support despite of several call attempts ( XXXX ) ) to ask about what is the reason for repeated denial of transfer. The chat responded to try transferring to other account instead of XXXX savings account, which was the XXXX  XXXX account. I tried that, and when this also did not work, I tried with lesser amount, as well as with exact amount such as {$46000.00} back to the XXXX  account from which it originally came, but none of these attempts was successful.

A little bit after several failed attempts to place
transfer of money request, Robinhood suddenly placed a restriction on my account. When I clicked on the restriction detail on Robinhood website, it showed steps to take, including present XX/XX/XXXX bank statement of XXXX. I downloaded the statement from XXXX XXXX  site to upload the statement Robinhood was requesting, but there was nowhere I could upload, neither a link was there. All I could do was to continue the page by clicking the continue button ( I do not quite remember what was it actually called, but this was the only thing I could do ). After clicking the button, it showed the following message : "" Your accounts are restricted until we finish our review.

Your account security is imperative to us, and as a precaution, you won't be able to open new positions or transfer funds on any of your Robinhood accounts while restricted. '' At this point I have no access to my money and all I got is the above message. Robinhood did not let me transfer my money back to my bank accounts, and it is now blocking me from accessing to my money for no appropriate reason and no explanation whatsoever, which is the same as freezing my fund by illegal means. I feel like this is even a criminal act Robinhood allegedly did against a powerless customer like me. I do not owe anything to Robinhood, nor I invested or made any purchases on their platform. All I did was to transfer money from my bank accounts to my account on Robinhood, and then tried to transfer that money back to my bank accounts.

I tried to reach out to Robinhood on XX/XX/XXXX all day using every possible means including sending chat messages and placing phone call request, but no response came so far. 
As of XX/XX/XXXX, Robinhood suddenly decided to close my account for no reason as it is now saying the following message : "" Were closing your Robinhood account due to recent account activity. Well notify you once were done. '' I can not reach out to them despite of many attempts via chat and request for call ( no real agent answered despite of calling their main number ), and I have no way to get my money back. Robinhood still holds my money as of XX/XX/XXXX. 
Hence, I am filing a formal complaint against Robinhood and I humbly ask you to intervene on this matter ASAP and let me have my money back from Robinhood that is currently illegally and unfairly withheld while having my account closed for no reason.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To whom it may concern : I am a XXXXXXXX XXXX  law abiding citizen. I am XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX held to highest degree and regard of moral, civil, and ethical duties and dealings. I am gainfully employed and do not engage in low vibrational and distasteful acts such as what is being described below. 
Unsure of exact initial dates, but on or about XX/XX/year> I was contacted by an XXXX XXXX  fraud department representative regarding "" potential fraudulent activities '' that had taken place on my fathers bank account in which I am a co op due to him developing XXXX XXXX. I was informed that there were several checks that were deposited into his primary account ( which is where he received his SSI checks every month ) and the bank cleared but returned back as "" bad checks ''. This was my first time learning of these circumstances and I explained to the representative that the checks in fact had to be fraudulent because I did not recognize the names of the individuals that appeared on them. I also explained that I was only on the account because of my fathers failing cognition and just in case we ever ran into problems such as him losing his card or inability to access his account, that my being on there would streamline this process of getting these issues situated, yet I've never as much passed a check through his account nor do I receive monetary gains through this account. The representative asked me to get in contact with my father because they were having no success at getting ahold of him because of phone connectivity issues. She did inform me at this time that they would proceed to close the account the first week of XXXX if there was no resolve. I would end up having the same issues with phone connectivity with my father as well and was unsuccessful at verifying things until the account was "" closed '' with XXXX XXXX. Once I was able to get to my father, he did inform me that his wallet was stolen ( which because of his XXXX XXXX, he kept his PIN number to his ATM card taped to the back of his card ). 
On or around XXXX, XXXX, I was attempting to be placed on my Husbands bank account with XXXX XXXX  when I was informed by the XXXX representative who ran a consumer banking report that I would not be able to be placed on his account due to me being flagged by "" XXXX '' for "" fraudulent check activity ''. I immediately requested my XXXX file and received my consumer report in the mail late XX/XX/year> which did state that I was reported for "" Suspected fraudulent activity '' involving an unpaid balance of {$2300.00}, owed to XXXX XXXX. After becoming aware of this, I made a trip up to XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX, Kansas where I was able to speak to a management team member by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX did provide me a copy of the bank statements showing that there had been a total of 3 checks that were apparently deposited at the ATM into my fathers account. I asked XXXX were any camera 's used to attempt to catch those responsible for the fraudulent activities to which her response was "" no ''. I asked XXXX if they tried to validate who wrote out the checks because the handwriting was not mines nor my fathers, to which XXXX responded "" no ''. Thirdly, I asked to see who endorsed the checks to check the signature and to my surprise, none of the three checks were ever endorsed. I asked XXXX why did the bank not take responsibility for allowing the checks to completely clear without an endorsement on the back to which her response was "" we were using the "" good faith '' rule to allow them to clear, as we have never had any issues with your fathers account in the past ''. XXXX refused to reverse their decision to "" hold me responsible '' for their bank allowing unendorsed, fraudulent checks to clear with every indication that these checks were not legit. 
Unfortunately, I have been denied access to being added to my husbands bank account with XXXX XXXX  due to me being added to XXXX, I have been denied an auto loan with my own XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and most recently learned that the fraudulent checks have been passed to a third party who have now flogged me that much more by adding a "" collections account '' to my credit report, which has lowered my score more than XXXX points. Not to mention my aging father has suffered all the same. 
Please see all exhibits attached below including the checks deposited with no endorsement, my fathers one page bank statement showing the banks allowed the cashing of the fraudulent checks, and my personal XXXX XXXX file showing the suspicious activity alert and amount owed to XXXX XXXX  ( as well as the many credit pulls I had attempting to gain access to a new auto loan for which I was denied, this includes my personal credit union who I've been in excellent standing with for more than 13 years ). After all, my bank would never cash an unendorsed check, not even a legitimate one.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MO,641XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11065419

Last month I requested an investigation because I felt the item was not being reported legally. Couple of days ago I received a letter stating that you have ceased investigation of my credit reports because, in your opinion, you believe that I have used a third-party credit repair agency. Not only do I believe this to be a stall tactic on your part to grant you an additional 30 days to comply with my original request, but I believe it to be a blatant violation of the FCRA. 
I have attached a copy of my government issued ID as well as mail showing proof of address. So, there shouldnt be no confusion or stall tactics on your end. I have maintained a careful record of my communications with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the FTC should you continue in your non-compliance. 
I request this under 15 U.S. Code 1692g - Validation of debts. If information is not provided or the false reporting isnt removed ; as in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  XXXX ), you may be liable for your willful non-compliance. Credit reporting laws ensure that bureaus report only 100 % accurate credit information.

7.If yes to above : a.Who did you speak to? 
b.On what date? 
c.How long was the conversation? 
d.What was their position? 
e.What telephone number did you call? 
f. What is the name of the employee of your company that spoke directly to the above party? 
g.What is the position of the employee of your company that spoke directly to the above party? 
h.How long has that employee been employed by your company? 
i.What formal training was provided to this employee to investigate items of this kind?

This information should not come as a form letter response. 

My initial dispute was detailed and directly related to the account in question. A template response will not be an acceptable response. If you can not supply ALL of the above information in a timely manner as detailed in several laws, including but not limited to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I must immediately demand the permanent removal of this item from my credit report. 

This erroneous entry is detrimental to my overall credit rating and has caused me severe financial and emotional distress.

Despite three previous attempts to resolve these issues and over 90 days passing since my initial disputewell beyond the legally mandated 30-day period under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) these inaccuracies remain unresolved. The credit bureaus have not complied with federal and state laws requiring the removal and blocking of fraudulent accounts and inquiries. The following violations have been committed : Failure to Investigate and Resolve Disputes : FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) mandates that credit bureaus investigate and resolve disputes within 30 days. More than 90 days have elapsed since my initial dispute without resolution.

Failure to Notify of Negative Information : Under 15 U.S.C. 1692g, creditors are required to notify consumers within five days of reporting a debt. I was never notified of these fraudulent accounts and inquiries. 
Failure to Ensure Maximum Accuracy : FCRA 607 ( b ) requires credit bureaus to ensure the maximum accuracy of the information they report. Discrepancies in balances, credit limits, and reporting dates indicate noncompliance. 
Failure to Remove and Block Fraudulent Accounts : Under FCRA 605B, upon receipt of evidence of identity theft, credit bureaus are required to remove and block fraudulent accounts and inquiries from credit reports. Despite providing substantial evidence, this has not occurred.

Failure to Protect Consumer Data : Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( 15 U.S.C. 6801-6809 ), financial institutions and credit bureaus are required to safeguard consumer information. The presence of these fraudulent accounts demonstrates a failure to protect my data. 
Identity Theft Protections Ignored : The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ) criminalizes the unauthorized use of personal information. The fraudulent accounts and inaction by the bureaus violate my rights under this statute.

State Law Violations : Under Florida Statute 817.568, identity theft is addressed as a criminal offense. The credit bureaus failure to act constitutes a violation of state protections. 
Fraudulent Accounts and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) ** : Reporting discrepancies in balances and dates, and balances exceeding credit limits. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) ** : Reporting discrepancies in balances, credit limits, and unresolved dispute comments. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) ** : Incorrect delinquency reporting and credit limit inaccuracies. 
XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ID unavailable ) : Unauthorized inquiry recorded without my knowledge or consent. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : Fraudulent account added without consent, failed to report for three months, and I was not notified XXXX days prior to reporting, violating 15 U.S.C. 1692g. 
Additional XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX These accounts are fraudulent and were added to my credit report without my consent. I was not notified within five days of their reporting as required by 15 U.S.C. 1692g. Additionally, these accounts show discrepancies and lack proper validation.

Requested Resolution Under FCRA 605B, I demand the immediate removal and permanent blocking of these accounts and inquiries from my credit report. Additionally, I request : A thorough investigation into the reporting failures and evidence of identity theft. 
Written confirmation of the removal and blocking of these accounts and inquiries. 
Implementation of fraud alerts and compliance with federal and state identity theft protections. 
The continued presence of these fraudulent accounts on my credit report has caused significant financial harm and emotional distress. If these issues are not resolved promptly, I will pursue legal action to protect my rights and escalate this matter to other regulatory authorities.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33544,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11069826

I am writing in response to an alleged debt. I am requesting validation of this debt as per my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 USC 1692g. I dispute the validity of this debt and am immediately requesting that you provide the following information : XXXX. The original contract binding me to this so-called debt. XXXX. The PAYMENT HISTORY with the original creditor and balance. XXXX. Copy of PROOF OF DEBT ASSIGNMENT. XXXX. Proof that I legally owe this debt to YOUR agency. XXXX. Proof that you are licensed and able to collect on this debt in my state. XXXX. The original PURCHASE AGREEMENT. A. THIS IS NOT ANY DEBT THAT I ORIGINATED MYSELF. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THIS DEBT ORIGINATED FROM. This inaccurate information needs to be re-investigated immediately by both the Credit reporting agencies and the furnishers of this information that is appearing on my consumer report. NOTE : As you can see within the screenshots that I have attached, Equifax removed this account XXXX  days ago. Please complete this file. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681e ( b ), A credit reporting agency must maintain accurate records at all times within the files of consumers. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681i, please perform an internal re-investigation on the validity of this account in question that is showing up on your consumer report under my name and notify me of your results within XXXX  days of your receipt of this letter and update my credit report accordingly to your findings. If you are unable to provide proof of my requests, then the erroneous information MUST be DELETED within XXXX  days of your receipt of this letter from my credit report as this erroneous account is very misleading and not mine. This account is causing me great mental anguish and I am unable to obtain a mortgage at this present time due to this inaccurate information on my credit report. Debt Collectors and Debt Buyers must furnish 100 % accurate information on consumers at all times. 15 USC 168s-2 Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information to Consumer Reporting Agencies ( a ) DUTY OF FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION ( 1 ) PROHIBITION ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. ( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors a person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. Please note that until the validity of this debt is verified, I demand that you CEASE all collection activities and CEASE REPORTING TO CREDIT BUREAUS IMMEDIATELY until complete and verified. Also, it is the duties of credit reporting agencies to uphold their grave responsibilities to supply 100 % accurate information ONLY on all consumer credit reports as the banking system itself hinges on accurate information. DELETE THIS ERRONEOUS INFORMATION from ALL credit bureaus immediately if the information can not be verified/validated.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am writing to formally dispute the reporting of an auto repossession on my credit report under account XXXX XXXX. This account was previously removed from my XXXX credit file, which demonstrates that the information is either inaccurate, unverifiable, or incomplete. Also, this account is being inaccurately reported for the full loan amount instead of reflecting the proper deficiency balance after the vehicle was sold at auction, as required by law. Furthermore, I was not provided with a required notice detailing the auction results and the remaining balance, which further invalidates the accuracy of this reporting. Therefore, I am requesting that you immediately investigate and remove this account from my credit file as required by federal law. 

Under 15 USC 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and consistent records. Disparities in reporting across the XXXX major bureaus call into question the accuracy of the information being furnished and your adherence to your duty under the FCRA to ensure maximum accuracy in consumer credit reports ( 15 USC 1681e ( b ) ). Credit bureaus must report only accurate, complete, and verifiable information. Reporting the full loan amount after a repossession and sale violates this standard of accuracy.

UCC 9-611 and 9-616 ( Uniform Commercial Code ) : Creditors are required to notify the borrower in writing of the time and place of the auction or sale of repossessed collateral ( 9-611 ). Additionally, after the sale, the creditor must provide an explanation of how the proceeds were applied, including the deficiency balance ( 9-616 ). Failure to provide this notice invalidates the debt or the claimed deficiency amount.

Additionally, the failure to verify the accuracy of this account may also constitute a violation of 15 USC 1681i, which requires prompt reinvestigation when a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of an item. Given that XXXX has already removed this account, I believe the same standard of accuracy should apply to your records. 

If the furnisher of this information ( XXXX BANK ) is unable to provide documentation verifying its accuracy and compliance with those applicable laws I stated, you must remove the account immediately. Reporting unverifiable or incomplete information violates 15 USC 1681s-2 ( b ), which prohibits furnishers from knowingly reporting inaccurate data.

I am also concerned that continuing to report this repossession despite its removal from another bureau may lead to harm under 15 USC 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which provide for remedies in cases of willful or negligent noncompliance with the FCRA. 

Reasons for Dispute : XXXX. Failure to Provide Required Notices : I did not receive a pre-sale notice or post-sale explanation of the proceeds and deficiency balance, as required by UCC 9-611 and 9-616. Without these notices, the creditor is in violation of its legal obligations, and the reporting of the debt is invalid. 

XXXX. Incorrect Amount Reported : If the repossessed vehicle was sold, only the deficiency balance ( remaining amount after the sale proceeds were applied ) can be reported, not the full loan amount. Reporting the full balance is a clear violation of 15 USC 1681e ( b ), requiring accuracy in credit reporting. 


Requested actions : I respectfully request that you XXXX. Reinvestigate the Account : I request that you reinvestigate this account and verify its accuracy with the furnisher of the information and require the furnisher to provide COMPLETE documentation verifying its accuracy. 

XXXX. Obtain Proof of Notices and Accuracy : Require the furnisher to provide documentation of the auction results, the pre-sale and post-sale notices, and the calculation of the deficiency balance. If they can not provide this information, the account must be removed from my report. 

XXXX. Correct or Remove the Account : If the information can not be verified or is found to be incomplete or inaccurate, this account must be corrected or removed from my credit file as required under 15 USC 1681i. 

XXXX. Provide me with a written response within XXXX  days, as required by the FCRA, detailing the results of your investigation and any actions taken. 


Please note that I am prepared to escalate this dispute to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), or other appropriate authorities if necessary.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Upon reviewing my consumer reports, I discovered multiple late payment entries associated with my account that were inaccurately reported. As you are aware, Consumer Reporting Agencies bear a significant responsibility to ensure that all consumer information is reported with maximum accuracy. It is essential that the information reflected on my credit profile is both accurate and truthful. 

Specifically, I have never been late with any payments for my BMW Financial account ( Account # XXXX ). I respectfully request a thorough investigation into these erroneous late payment entries and demand that you provide verifiable proof, including statements, that demonstrate these payments were indeed late. To assist in this process, I can provide supporting documentation, including bank statements, payment notifications, timestamps from the BMW payment app, and screenshots. 

Additionally, it is important to note that there have been substantial testimonies and reviews from numerous BMW customers who have experienced similar issues regarding premature reporting of late payments. These reports indicate a pattern of errors where late payment flags are applied prematurely, negatively impacting credit scores. This further highlights the possibility of an internal issue with BMW Financials reporting practices, which needs immediate investigation. 

If sufficient proof can not be provided to substantiate these late payments, I demand the immediate removal of the derogatory marks and request that the account status be corrected to reflect "" on time, never late, '' as this accurately represents the history of my payments. 

I have previously submitted multiple requests to the credit bureaus to address this issue, but to no avail. I am now seeking your assistance to rectify this error and ensure that my credit profile accurately reflects my payment history. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.",,"BMW Financial Services NA, LLC",MD,21060,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,No,,11070789

This situation has caused me significant frustration and has negatively impacted my ability to secure a mortgage for a home. 

Despite numerous calls to Equifaxs customer service number, I have been unable to resolve this issue. I have been repeatedly instructed to send documentation to have the fraud alert removed, which I have done. I provided a copy of my ID and a W-2 as requested. Despite this, I continue to be informed by Equifax representatives that : There is no fraud alert on my report, even though my lender has confirmed its existence. 
The fraud alert remains, which prevents my lender from accessing my credit report. 
I have been given conflicting information, and the lack of resolution has been beyond frustrating. To make matters worse, the Equifax phone line frequently disconnects or directs me to representatives who offer no actionable assistance, leaving me feeling as though I am being given the runaround. 

This issue has reached a critical point. I am in the process of purchasing a home, and the unresolved fraud alert is jeopardizing my ability to proceed. I am at my wits end trying to navigate Equifaxs unhelpful system. 

I request your assistance in addressing the following : Immediate removal of the fraud alert from my credit report. 
A thorough investigation into Equifaxs handling of my case and their failure to resolve this issue despite my compliance with their instructions. 
Improved customer service processes to prevent similar issues from happening to others in the future. 
Please let me know if any additional documentation is required to expedite the resolution of this matter.

Subject : Inaccurate Credit Reporting by Equifax To whom it may concern I am writing to formally address a concerning issue regarding my credit report as reported by Equifax. I have noticed that Equifax has been reporting false and misleading information across different scoring models. 

Upon reviewing my credit reports from XXXX and XXXX, I found that there is no XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account listed. If the reporting from XXXX XXXX XXXX  were accurate, this account should be reflected across all three major credit bureaus. 

I am also including a copy of my Equifax credit report obtained from XXXX for your review. It is clear that Equifax has violated the provisions outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681, specifically regarding the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting.

I kindly request that the CFPB take appropriate action to ensure that the inaccurate XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX account is removed from my credit report.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Specifically : 1. An account reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) regarding a vehicle loan. 
2. An account reported by XXXX XXXX, which I have never had any dealings with. 

I have never opened an account with either XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, nor have I had any financial transactions or agreements with these institutions. The reporting of these accounts is false, unverifiable, and a violation of my consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681.

As per the FCRA, you are required to ensure all information on my credit report is accurate and verifiable. Failure to do so constitutes a direct violation of federal law. These accounts can not be verified because they are fraudulent and do not belong to me.

Demands : 1. Remove these accounts from my credit report immediately and ensure no further reporting from these institutions regarding these accounts.

2. Provide written confirmation of the removal of these accounts within three ( 3 ) days of receiving this letter.

3. Cease reporting any negative or unauthorized information about me from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, or any related entities. 

Failure to act within the specified timeframe will leave me no choice but to escalate this matter by filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursuing legal remedies. 

I have attached a copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed accounts for your reference, along with the required proof of my identity, including a government-issued ID and utility bill. 

Please treat this correspondence as a formal and urgent dispute. I expect a resolution within the next three ( 3 ) business days to avoid further action.

There is information on my consumer report that I did not provide written permission, instructions, or consent to be reported on my consumer report as a result of identity theft. Therefore, I am formally requesting that the reporting of this inaccurate and fraudulent information be blocked and deleted.

My request for the blockage and deletion of this data is not a mistake, nor is it founded on any misrepresentation of facts on my part. I am committed to ensuring the accuracy and integrity of my credit report, and as such, I am rightfully seeking the removal of these wrongfully attributed transactions. It is crucial to clarify that the transactions identified in my report are in no way associated with any of my legitimate financial activities. As the victim of identity theft, these transactions do not represent any transaction undertaken by me as the rightful consumer.

In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I am entitled to a fair and accurate representation of my credit history. I kindly ask that you investigate this situation promptly and take the necessary steps to remove the fraudulent accounts from my credit report. I understand the importance of a correct credit profile and its implications for my financial well-being.

Enclosed with this letter are copies of documents substantiating my identity and the fraudulent nature of the reported transactions and trust that these documents will provide the evidence required to facilitate a swift resolution of this issue. I kindly request a written confirmation once the fraudulent accounts have been removed from my credit report.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX **Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ** Dear Equifax Customer Service XXXX I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against Equifax regarding your violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I have experienced multiple instances of mishandling of my personal information and disputes following the compromise of my credit file over the past four months. 

In [ XXXX ], I initiated an FTC fraud report which was placed on all of my credit files due to the compromise. Following this, I began disputing several inaccurate and fraudulent items listed on my credit report, as is my right under the FCRA. 

However, from the very onset of my disputes, Equifax has been non-compliant and infringed upon my rights. Instead of conducting a thorough investigation, Equifax has verified and updated accounts currently in dispute without providing me with substantial proof or documentation regarding these trade lines. When I requested verification of these accounts, my requests were disregarded. 

Additionally, I must supplement this complaint to highlight further violations and injuries. Each time within the last two months that Ive disputed or requested verification and the method of verification, Equifax has further injured me by actively reopening the closed account with XXXX XXXX XXXX and reporting it as being late, indicating I am missing payments in arrearage of currently XXXX payments, with the first being over XXXX. I have directly communicated with representatives from XXXX, who assured me that these changes and inaccurate reporting were not initiated by them but rather resulted from actions taken by Equifax. 

Each time this inaccurate reporting occurs, I instantly lose XXXX points on my credit score. Furthermore, regarding the XXXX account, in the last XXXX instances that Ive asked for verification and the method of verification, Equifax has re-reported the statement in collections as if it is new or has been removed from my report. However, this is not the case ; the derogatory account has never left my report. The resubmission of this collections statement has caused significant harm to my credit report, presenting the information as if it is being reported for the first time. This misrepresentation has negatively impacted my credit standing, and I seek to address this issue promptly. 

Despite my numerous complaints, disputes, and requests for verification regarding the reporting of these trade lines, I took the additional step of reaching out to the agency responsible for the alleged debt with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. They reported that the alleged collection account has been closed since XXXX. This revelation underscores that Equifax has consistently failed to adhere to FCRA statutes and guidelines, neglecting to fulfill its mandated duty to conduct proper investigations and furnish accurate account information. Such failures only compound the egregious conduct that I have endured. 

To broaden and strengthen my complaint, I would like to specifically cite violations of the FCRA relating to Section 617 [ 15 U.S.C 1681o ]. These include the allowance of facially false information, such as inflated original and charge-off amounts, the reporting of accounts with delinquent or late payments when, in fact, no delinquency is present according to payment history ( 30, 60, 90 days, etc. ), and inconsistencies in consumer account information that clearly indicate that at least one piece of information must be inaccurate.

For example, if every other tradeline indicates ongoing payment activity while one tradeline contains a "" deceased '' indicator, reasonable policies and procedures should identify this inconsistency, and the consumer reporting agency should prevent the inclusion of the inaccurate information in consumer reports it generates. As stipulated in Section 607 ( b ) of the FCRA, whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report, it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. The Bureau has interpreted this requirement to necessitate that consumer reporting agencies implement and maintain reasonable screening procedures designed to identify and prevent the inclusion of facially false data, including logical inconsistencies in consumer or account information.

I would also like to draw your attention to Sections 616 and 617 of the FCRA. Section 616 states that "" any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to '' actual or statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation, along with punitive damages that the court allows, and costs and reasonable attorney 's fees. A violation is considered willful when it is inconsistent with "" authoritative guidance '' from relevant agencies. Such guidance includes that issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), as consumer reporting agencies face significant liability risks under Section 616 if they violate the FCRA.

In addition, Section 617 emphasizes that "" any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to '' the consumer 's actual damages, along with costs and reasonable attorney 's fees. Given the negligence evidenced in Equifax 's handling of my disputes and the clear violations of the FCRA, I believe I am entitled to compensation.

In support of these allegations, I would like to reference case law, including **Bryant v. TRW, Inc.**, where the court rejected a consumer reporting agency 's assertion that it had "" no obligation '' to compare facially inconsistent information contained in different consumer reports. Furthermore, in **Davis v. Equifax , Inc.** , the court ruled that the presence of erroneous data on a consumer report can demonstrate the unreasonableness of reporting agency procedures. This aligns with **Hammer v. Sams East , Inc.**, where the court acknowledged that consumer reporting agencies might be liable for damages due to negligence in maintaining accurate records.

Equifaxs continued failure to adhere to these legal standards has resulted in the ongoing reporting of inaccurate information, causing me substantial financial harm and stress. In an effort to resolve these issues, I escalated matters by submitting complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). Unfortunately, each complaint resulted in further demands for identity verification, including requests for lease agreements, XXXX change of address verification, XXXX forms, my Georgia ID , and long and short form birth certificates. I submitted all of these requested documents without any resolution or changes to my personal information, including my name ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), job history ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), and current address ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  ). 

This continuous process has not only caused considerable inconvenience but has also been met with what I can only interpret as malicious intent to delay the resolution of my disputes. 

As per the FCRA, I am entitled to request compensation for damages caused by these violations. Therefore, I am formally demanding compensation for the undue stress and inconvenience suffered due to the mishandling of my credit information, as well as reimbursement for any costs incurred as a result of this situation. 

I expect to hear from you within 30 days of this letter regarding the actions you plan to take. Should I not receive a satisfactory response, I will consider escalating my complaint to the relevant authorities, including legal counsel. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

10. Claims of Harassment and Abuse : Per FDCPA 806, I feel harassed and abused due to the continuous reporting of inaccurate items and unwarranted communications from creditors.

11. Identity Theft and Unauthorized Sharing : My information was illegally shared and used without my genuine consent, resulting in a case of identity theft as defined by Section 1581a ( 3 ).

12. Reporting Inaccuracies : Your reporting of late payments without clear definitions in TILA, FCRA, and FDCPA is deceptive and violates FCRA laws.

13. 15 U.S. Code 1692j Furnishing Certain Deceptive Forms : Any contract signed without my participation in the debt collection violates 15 USC 1692j.

14. Requests Pertaining to Debts : I am the original creditor, and only I can validate any debts. The debts reported by you are unvalidated and must be removed.

15. 15 U.S. Code 1681b Permissible Purposes of Consumer Reports : You have acted without my written consent, which equates to identity theft. 

I, XXXX XXXX did not consent to, authorize, or benefit from any of the reported inquiries or accounts. These are inaccurate, and I demand their removal.

Being the only original creditor, I hold the sole right to authenticate this debt. Therefore, I HEREBY DECLARE THAT I DO NOT RECOGNIZE THIS DEBT.

Dispute Instruction : According to the provisions of 15 USC 1692g, 15 USC 1681b, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have not granted any permission for your agency to list this public record on my credit report. For all accounts mentioned above, I require verification and validation of every detail including notations, dates, and balances, irrespective of their reported status.

This account has always been current, and proof should be available demonstrating that any statements were mailed to me at least 21 days prior to any due payment. As per FCRA Sections 605, 609, and 623, I request this evidence. Additionally, as this is listed as a collection account, the collecting party must authenticate the survivability of this debt, their ownership of the debt, their collection rights, and that all their details align with the original creditor. Without such proof, the entry must be deleted. Finally, as outlined in 15 USC 1681b related to the permissible purposes of consumer reports : it is expressly articulated that a consumer reporting agency may provide a report in line with the written instructions of the associated consumer. The record of this account is erroneous ; I have never defaulted on my payments.

This change occurred after I paid off one of my credit cards with a different company. I was unaware of a {$16.00} interest charge from that company, as they did not contact me by phone or mail. Unfortunately, this led to my account becoming 30 days past due. 

I only discovered this situation when I received a credit alert indicating that I had a past-due account. As a result, my credit score dropped from XXXX to XXXX, which has been a significant setback for me. 

I have been a loyal customer of Synchrony Bank/PayPal and have never missed a payment in the history of my account. I have always made timely payments, and I do not believe my credit limit should have been decreased without considering my overall payment history. 

Therefore, I am requesting that Synchrony Bank/PayPal review my account and reinstate my credit limit to the previous amount of {$13000.00}. I have worked hard to establish my credit line, and I believe this situation is unjust.

Their actions are in violation of federal laws, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and applicable Credit Reporting ( CR ) rules outlined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Details of the Complaint : XXXX. Failure to Validate the Debt : Upon initial contact by [ Debt Collectors Name ], I requested validation of the alleged debt in writing, as allowed under the FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ). Despite my request, the company has failed to provide proper validation, including proof that the debt is valid, that they own the debt or have the right to collect it, and a full accounting of the amount owed. 

XXXX. Debt Not Collectible Under CR Rules : It is my understanding that under federal law, debts sold to collection agencies may not be collectible unless the agency can legally demonstrate ownership and compliance with XXXX rules. Specifically : Credit Reporting Rules ( FCRA ) : Debts sold to collection agencies must include complete and accurate information about the debt, including its origin, the amount, and whether the statute of limitations has expired. Agencies must also notify credit bureaus if a debt is disputed. 

Debt Ownership : If the original creditor sold the debt, the collector must provide a clear chain of title proving their legal right to collect the debt. [ Debt Collectors Name ] has not provided this. 

XXXX. Violation of My Rights : The debt in question appears to be unverified, unenforceable, and possibly past the statute of limitations for collection under [ applicable state law ].

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Account Name : SEZZLE INC Date Opened : XX/XX/year> Issue : This account has been charged-off with {$1700.00} written off. It continues to appear as an active debt, despite it being written off and reported to the IRS as gross income, violating 15 USC 1681s-2 ( b ) and FDCPA 1692e. I WANT THIS ACCOUNT TO BE DELETE IMMEDIATELY NO CONSENT WAS GIVEN TO REPORT SUCH INFORMATION. I want to OPT-OUT OF SHARING. REMOVE ACCOUNT. Under IRS guidelines, once a debt has been charged off and reported on a 1099-C as gross income, it is no longer legally considered a collectible debt. Continuing to report such an account as charged-off or written-off, when the IRS has acknowledged it as income, violates 15 USC 1681s-2 ( b ) and constitutes false representation, as defined in XXXX 's XXXX XXXX. Furthermore, under Bankruptcy law, the debtors obligations are considered XXXX, and the debt should not be misrepresented as due or owing. 


- FCRA ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ) 15 USC 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Prohibits reporting information that is known to be inaccurate or misleading. Reporting a charged-off account as an active debt violates this provision.

15 USC 1681e ( b ) Mandates credit reporting agencies to ensure maximum possible accuracy in consumer reports, which includes accurately reflecting a charged-off debt status.

15 USC 1681i ( a ) Requires proper investigation of disputed information and timely correction if inaccuracies are found.

FDCPA ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ) 15 USC 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) Prohibits false representation of the character, amount, or legal status of any debt. Listing a charged-off account as active violates this clause.

15 USC 1692f Prohibits unfair or unconscionable means to collect or report a debt. Reporting a written-off debt as active is deceptive and harmful.

IRS Reporting Violations 26 USC 61 ( a ) ( 12 ) A charged-off amount reported to the IRS as gross income ( Form 1099-C ) indicates the debt has been forgiven. Continuing to report this as an active debt misrepresents the legal status of the account.

Key Points to Dispute Once a debt is charged off and reported to the IRS as gross income, the creditor acknowledges it as uncollectible. It can not legally remain an "" active '' debt on the credit report.

Reporting this incorrectly inflates liabilities and damages the consumers creditworthiness, constituting unfair reporting practices.

UCC 9-210 Request for Accounting : This section requires the creditor to provide an accurate accounting of the debt. If the account is charged off, any discrepancies or incomplete information about its status can support its removal.

UCC 1-304 Obligation of Good Faith : Creditors and furnishers must act in good faith. Reporting a charged-off account as active violates this obligation, as it misrepresents the true status of the account.

UCC 2-615 Unconscionability : Continuing to report a charged-off account as active, especially after being reported to the IRS, can be argued as an unconscionable act that harms the consumer.

USC ( United States Code ) Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 USC 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Duty to Update Information : Creditors must promptly update and correct any inaccurate information. A charged-off account should not remain as active.

15 USC 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) Obsolete Information : Charged-off debts must not remain on a credit report beyond seven years from the date of delinquency.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 USC 1692e ( 10 ) False or Deceptive Practices : Reporting a charged-off account inaccurately can be classified as a deceptive practice.

15 USC 1692e ( 8 ) Failure to Communicate Dispute : If the account is disputed, the creditor must note this status in credit reports. Failing to do so violates this provision.

IRS Reporting Codes 26 USC 6050P Debt Discharge Reporting : Once a debt is discharged and reported on Form 1099-C to the IRS, it is considered forgiven. Reporting this as active debt on a credit report misrepresents its legal status.

Unfair Practices and Contractual Law 15 USC 45 ( a ) Unfair Trade Practices : Reporting false information about a charged-off account constitutes an unfair trade practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

15 USC 1637 ( b ) Billing Error Correction : Failure to correct inaccuracies related to charge-offs may be a billing violation.",,Sezzle Inc.,NY,139XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11067528

2024-12-07,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am submitting a formal complaint against Goldman Sachs and Apple Card regarding what I believe are unfair and abusive business practices, particularly concerning their failure to provide proper billing statements and account notifications, which has negatively affected my credit standing. 

Background : Fraudulent Charge and Account Lock : On XXXX XXXX XXXX I discovered a fraudulent charge of {$24.00} on my Apple Card when I payed my XXXX bill, and immediately contacted Apple via their support chat to report the issue. Apple acknowledged the fraudulent charge and reversed it on XX/XX/XXXX. However, without my knowledge, my Apple Card account was locked due to the fraudulent charge and the fact that the chat session with Apple support ended unexpectedly due to connectivity. I believed the issue had been resolved at that time. 


Failure to Provide Billing Statements : After my account was locked, I did not receive any billing statements from Goldman Sachs/Apple Card via email ( XXXX ), which was my primary form of communication. The last email to me on XX/XX/2024, ( see attached ) was regarding the fraudulent charge reverse and the next email, XX/XX/XXXX, was after I had discovered the account lock and paid my outstanding bill. Additionally, I had recently moved, and all my mail was being forwarded to my new address, including Apple card statements. However, I never received any paper bills after the lock from Goldman Sachs/Apple Card , despite the fact that my mail forwarding was properly set up. 


Discovery of the Issue : I only became aware that my account had been locked and that payments were overdue in midXXXX XXXX, when I checked my credit report and saw late payment entries. Prior to this, I had not received any notifications or bills, either by email, phone or postal mail, informing me of the locked account or outstanding balances. The lack of communication left me unaware of any issues with my account until the damage to my credit score had already occurred. Up until this point, I have had nearly perfect credit for decades.

Impact on My Credit : Due to the failure of Goldman Sachs/Apple Card to send billing statements or communicate that my account was locked, I unknowingly incurred late payments, which have been reported to the credit bureaus and have negatively impacted my credit score. Additionally, this has prevented me from refinancing my home mortgage resulting in the loss of XXXX of dollars, as long as my credit is impacted. I believe this situation could have been avoided had Goldman Sachs/Apple Card fulfilled their obligations to provide proper notifications and statements. When I contacted Goldman Sachs about this via phone multiple times in XXXX and XXXX, my claim review was denied as they stated it was "" fair and accurate reporting, '' to credit bureaus. 


Request for CFPB Intervention : I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter and determine whether Goldman Sachs and Apple Card have engaged in unfair and abusive business practices by : Failing to send me periodic billing statements or any form of notification ( email or mail ) informing me of my account status. 
Locking my account without proper email or mail communication following the fraudulent charge and support chat issue.

Reporting late payments to the credit bureaus, despite my lack of knowledge of the account lock and overdue payments.

Details of the Complaint : 1.Failure to Validate the Debt : This debt is required to be validated under the FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C.1692g ). the company has failed to provide proper validation, including proof that the debt is valid, that they own the debt or have the right to collect it, and a full accounting of the amount owed. 2. Debt Not Collectible Under CR Rules : Under federal law, debts sold to collection agencies may not be collectible unless the agency can legally demonstrate ownership and compliance with CR rules. Specifically : Credit Reporting Rules ( FCRA ) : Debts sold to collection agencies must include complete and accurate information about the debt, including its origin, the amount, and whether the statute of limitations has expired. Agencies must also notify credit bureaus if a debt is disputed. Debt Ownership : If the original creditor sold the debt, the collector must provide a clear chain of title proving their legal right to collect the debt. XXXX XXXX XXXX on behalf of Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC has not provided this. 3.

Copy of identification, validation documentation of my legal address and a lease agreement without signatures per leesee request. 

I sent these documents through US mail to all 3 major credit bereaus, I also uploaded the documentation, police report and FTC report to all 3 bereaus. 

I've actually uploaded the supporting documentation multiple times to all of the Bereaus, Equifax, XXXX and XXXX throughout the month of XXXX. 

Since uploading the original documentation plus a dispute letter outlining my rights through the resource pages on the FTC website I have uploaded additional documentation validating my residence outside of the US from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

The accts that were not blocked or deleted were disputed originally and again on XX/XX/XXXX when I uploaded the lease agreement to all 3 bereaus. 

Equifax and XXXX have platforms that provide multiple ways of disputing accts on my credit report and XXXX website is set up to navigate the user through a sales funnel for the paid membership that they offer users that require frequent credit reports and scores. 
Since beginning the repair journey I've logged over 26hours online and on chat plus phone calls to agents at XXXX. 
Nothing in that entire time has provided online access to my credit report. 
They continual share the same troubleshooting data that they have in script and that I have followed multiple times to get a copy of my report. 

I recently filed a dispute about the issues with XXXX  timeliness and less than attentive concern to address the inquiries and fraudulent accts that are still on my credit report. My request was to get results or answers to my original dispute and identity theft case filed early XXXX. 
XXXX has told me that the platform they use has technical issues and that they will be resolved within XXXX to 3 days of time however this is not true, I can not access my credit report through the XXXX platform. 

My request is that XXXX remove the hard inquiries from my credit report as they are fraudulent and numerous, I also request that they block the additional accts that I disputed with documentation on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX with validating documentation that I included with all of my disputes. 

The complaint that I filed prevuousky through CFPB about XXXX barely touches the issues, delays and absence of action that XXXX has exampled throughout my effort to restore my good credit standing. The process has not been as stated in the Fair Credit Reporting Act and I want the hard inquiries and fraudulent accts blocked from my profile, and from potential credit opportunities. 
The response that I received after using this platform to express the problems that have been encountered do not hold this company accountable for the lack of action and the lack of progress despite following the FTC guidelines to restore my credit rating to pre identity theft condition. 
By allowing XXXX additional time after 30 days has passed is not providing me the consumer with anything that I wasn't already experiencing before addressing my issues to the CFPB. 

PLEASE make XXXX address the identity theft accts on my report, remove all of the fraudulent inquiries so I can begin to build a healthy FICO score. The opportunity that having good credit provides has been stolen from me and time is of the essence. I own a company and can not provide the basics of ownership to the people that XXXX employee. Getting funding of any amount to grow the company in order to hire more people is passing me by and the time, effort and energy that I have applied to just getting back to XXXX has been mountainous by any standard. 

My request is to not give this company any more of the most valuable commodity we have as humans, TIME. 
Please make this company do the right thing and remove the negative and fraudulent inquiries that plaque my credit profile immediately. 

Thank you so very much!

Their actions are in violation of federal laws, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and applicable Credit Reporting ( CR ) rules outlined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Details of the Complaint : 1.Failure to Validate the Debt : This debt is required to be validated under the FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ). the company has failed to provide proper validation, including proof that the debt is valid, that they own the debt or have the right to collect it, and a full accounting of the amount owed. 2. Debt Not Collectible Under CR Rules : Under federal law, debts sold to collection agencies may not be collectible unless the agency can legally demonstrate ownership and compliance with CR rules. Specifically : Credit Reporting Rules ( FCRA ) : Debts sold to collection agencies must include complete and accurate information about the debt, including its origin, the amount, and whether the statute of limitations has expired. Agencies must also notify credit bureaus if a debt is disputed. Debt Ownership : If the original creditor sold the debt, the collector must provide a clear chain of title proving their legal right to collect the debt. Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC has not provided this. 3. Violation of My Rights : The debt in question appears to be unverified, unenforceable, and possibly under applicable state law Attempting to collect this debt without validation is a violation of my consumer rights under the FDCPA and FCRA.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,AZ,85743,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11066743

This abrupt restriction occurred without any prior notice, leaving me completely unable to access or transfer the funds in my account. This situation is not just inconvenient ; it is causing me significant financial distress.

Despite my relentless attempts to reach Robinhoods customer service, including several emails and a request for a promised callback, I have received absolutely no response. The company 's total lack of communication is alarming and has left me feeling trapped and powerless. I am in a perilous situation where I can not reach my own money, which is exacerbating my financial stress and uncertainty. 

Moreover, it appears that I am not alone in this plight. Many others are voicing similar complaints on social media, highlighting a concerning trend of inadequate customer support from Robinhood. This lack of accountability and transparency is completely unacceptable, and it raises questions about the companys practices and commitment to its customers. 

I urgently seek your assistance in this matter. My financial well-being is at stake, and I feel that immediate action is necessary to resolve my account restriction and address the troubling customer service issues prevalent at Robinhood.

He gave me my options and assured me they would be able to work with me to keep the house. 

Both parents have now passed and I have requested an extenstion to pay off my parents reverse mortgage after their deaths, as XXXX and I had discussed. I have sent requested paperwork from my mortgage lender, but I still keep receiving letters in the mail requesting documentation. 

I am not getting responses to email when I send documentation. 

I have tried for weeks to make contact with XXXX, my local contact with Finance of America, Reverse. When I call, a generic recording states that they are experiencing high call volumes and to call back at a later time. This has happened for weeks now. The only other number I have is to a call center. I have called and spoke with someone there, but there is a strong language barrier that makes problem solving and understanding difficult, and they can only give me a scripted answer.

During this time, I have maintained accounts with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, all of which I have used to make payments. I have consistently made various purchases and payments, keeping my account well. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid off my Amex card with an electronic payment of {$5400.00} from my XXXX ( also known as XXXX ) account. On the same day, I made a purchase of {$2900.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a bathroom vanity. Additionally, I made another payment of {$2500.00} from my XXXX account that day. I then attempted to use my card again for a {$1800.00} purchase at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, but my account was suspended. 
Concerned, I called Amex to find out why I could not use my account. An Amex representative informed me that the funds needed to be verified. I authorized a conference call with my bank, XXXX, but unfortunately, the call was disconnected, forcing me to use another credit card to complete my purchase at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to use my Amex card again, but it was declined. I made another attempt on XX/XX/XXXX, and once again, the card was declined. I then noticed on my mobile Amex app that my charging privileges were suspended and I was directed to call XXXX. 
During that call, a representative explained that my charging privileges were suspended because I needed to verify my demographics and the ownership of the account from which I made the payments. I asked for clarification and requested written policy on this requirement, but I was advised to refer to my membership agreement. When I inquired about the reason for this request and what prompted it, I was informed that it was due to the suspicious nature of the recent amounts paid to my account. 
I explained that the accounts from which I made the payments are mine and have been linked to my Amex card since I opened it. The representative informed me that I would need to provide certain information, including my demographics and bank statements, and that my bank would need to be contacted again to verify the {$2500.00} payment made. 
I requested to speak with a supervisor. After three unsuccessful attempts to reach a supervisor named XXXX ( XXXX ), I finally spoke with XXXX, an American Express Financial Review Supervisor, on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained the situation and again requested the policy information. XXXX reiterated that I needed to verify my information by providing bank statements, pay stubs, and that my bank would need to be contacted to verify the {$2500.00} payment. When I asked why this was necessary, she stated that some customers in the past had reported unauthorized payments made by a third party, and there were recent unusual charging patterns on my account. I clarified that I had made the payments and authorized the charge to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  as well as the attempted charge of {$1800.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was declined without notice. I inquired whether there had been any history of fraud or suspicious activity on my account in the past. XXXX confirmed that my payments and charges had shown a great history since I opened the account and that there were no previous issues. 
Despite this, she explained that the review process required me to provide the requested documentation by XX/XX/XXXX, or my account would be canceled. I explained to her that I did not agree with it and it appears that I am being discriminated against and targeted since I paid the account off and made payments of over XXXX XXXX I asked XXXX had Amex had difficulty receiving the funds from that account in the past or currently.

4. Proof that your company has the legal right to collect on this debt, including all assignment or sale agreements that show the chain of ownership from the original creditor to your company. 

Additionally, I have reason to believe that this debt may have been charged off by the original creditor. Under IRS guidelines, canceled debts over {$600.00} require a 1099-C form to be issued. To date, I have not received this form, which raises questions about whether this debt has already been forgiven or canceled. Please provide confirmation of whether the original creditor has charged off this debt, and why I have not been issued a 1099-C form. 

Furthermore, I would like clarification regarding the statute of limitations for this debt. Please confirm that this debt is still within the legal statute of limitations for collection in my state. If the statute of limitations has expired, I request that all collection efforts cease immediately and that any reporting of this debt to the credit bureaus be removed. 

I also want to highlight the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which governs the accuracy of information reported to credit bureaus. If you are reporting this debt to any credit reporting agencies without providing proper validation, it constitutes a violation of the FCRA. Therefore, if you are unable to provide the requested validation of this debt, I demand that all references to this account be removed from my credit report immediately. 

If you are unable to provide sufficient validation as outlined in this letter, I request the following actions : 1. Cease all collection activities related to this account. 
2. Remove any references to this debt from my credit report with the major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). 
3. Provide written confirmation that this debt has been resolved and is no longer being pursued.

Failure to comply with these requests may result in my filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my state attorney generals office, as well as pursuing other legal remedies available to me. 

Please respond within 30 days of receipt of this letter with full validation of the debt or confirmation that the debt has been canceled and removed from my credit reports.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,MS,386XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11067268

2024-12-07,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On the morning of XX/XX/year>, my Bank of America credit card was stolen from my purse, probably when I was visiting with some friends at XXXX in XXXX, Maryland. I did not realize that my card had been stolen, until later in the day, when I checked my phone voice messages, and there was a message from Bank of America. Thinking it might be a scam ( it wasn't ) I looked up the phone number of B of A on my latest bill, and called that number. I learned from that call, that, unknown to me, my credit card had been used at a XXXX. I then checked my purse, and realized that my B of A credit card had, in fact, been stolen. 

Bank of America agreed to send me a new card, with a new account number, and I was left with the understanding that the {$100.00} charged on my stolen card, would be removed. But yesterday, I received a letter in the mail from Bank of America saying that B of A was "" unable to approve '' my "" recent claim. '' In other words, that {$100.00} charge will remain on my account. 

Once I had learned that my card was stolen, I alerted management at the XXXX where the theft of my card had occurred. I also alerted the XXXX XXXX Police Department, by filing a report, through their non-emergency phone number. 

I have no other problem with Bank of America. They were prompt in sending me the new card. But I want the {$100.00} charge that was incurred after my credit card was stolen, removed from my bill. I always pay my balance in full, but I am not willing to pay for a purchase made with my credit card, after it was stolen. 

I think that the fact that Bank of America called me after the purchase was made at Target, shows that B of A in fact had reason to believe that the purchase made was not by me, but rather on a card that had been stolen from me. I don't know what that reason might have been, but somehow they must have known that this was not a purchase by me, but rather by someone else with my stolen card.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",MD,20815,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11066965

2024-12-07,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to report a fraudulent scam involving an individual impersonating a representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Below are the details of the incident, the vulnerabilities I observed in XXXX XXXX and Cash Apps systems, and the efforts I made to resolve this matter with both companies. 

Incident Details : In early XXXX, I received a phone call from someone claiming to be from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They informed me of suspicious transactions from Florida on my checking account and asked me to confirm my location. They also referenced my account balance, leading me to believe they had access to my sensitive banking information. 

The caller claimed my debit card was compromised and would be frozen but provided a temporary replacement debit card number. They instructed me to transfer {$1000.00} from my account to my Cash App and then to this new debit card to avoid disruption to my finances and pay my bills. Unfortunately, after completing the transfer, I realized I had been defrauded when the scammers hung up. 

Vulnerabilities Identified : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : The scammers knowledge of my account balance and transaction history indicates a potential breach or successful phishing scheme targeting XXXX XXXX customers. 
The caller convincingly posed as a XXXX XXXX representative, highlighting flaws in the verification process for customer interactions. 
Cash Apps Lack of Safeguards : The transfer of funds through Cash App to fraudulent recipients underscores a lack of robust security mechanisms to flag suspicious activity. 
Once the transfer was completed, I found limited options for recourse or recovery of the funds, leaving victims without adequate protection. 
Efforts Made to Resolve the Issue : Following the incident, I promptly filed an investigation with both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Cash App. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX informed me they have XXXX liability for actions taken by account holders, even in cases of social engineering scams. They disregarded the fraudulent context and did not acknowledge the role of potential vulnerabilities in their systems. 
Cash App Response : I filed a report with Cash App seeking assistance in recovering the transferred funds. However, the platforms limited options for investigating fraud left me without resolution or recourse. 
Request for Investigation and Support : This fraudulent activity has caused financial and emotional hardship, and I am concerned about the systemic vulnerabilities in both XXXX XXXX and Cash App that facilitated this scam. I respectfully request the FTC investigate these issues and take steps to ensure these companies improve their security measures and customer protections. 

Additionally, I would appreciate any guidance on recovering my lost funds and protecting myself from similar scams in the future. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am available to provide further details or documentation as needed.

This action has caused significant inconvenience and potential harm to my credit rating, and I seek immediate intervention to resolve this issue. 

**Details of the Complaint : ** - **Account Information : ** Loan Account Number : [ XXXX ] Vehicle Details : [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  ] - **Incident Description : ** On XXXX XXXX, I attempted to make a scheduled payment for my auto loan through an external bank transfer, from my XXXX  personal checking account. However, Northwest Bank refused to accept the payment without any prior notice or explanation. This refusal occurred despite my account with XXXX XXXX  being in good standing and having the verified funds. 

- **Consumer Protection Concerns : ** Under federal consumer protection laws, particularly those concerning fair lending and debt collection practices, financial institutions are required to provide borrowers with clear communication regarding their accounts. Northwest Banks failure to accept my payment and their lack of communication constitutes a breach of these obligations and may violate regulations under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). 

**Impact on Consumer : ** - The refusal to accept my payment has caused undue stress and confusion. 
- This incident could potentially impact my credit score and financial standing, as it may be recorded as a missed payment. 
- I have incurred additional costs and time in attempting to resolve this issue directly with the bank, with no satisfactory response. 


Please find attached copies of relevant documents, including correspondence with Northwest Bank and any other supporting materials. 

I trust that the CFPB will address this matter promptly to ensure compliance with federal consumer protection standards. I look forward to your swift response and resolution.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing in response to your recent attempts to collect on an alleged debt. To date, the only documents I have received are billing statements, which do not provide sufficient proof that I owe this debt. You have not provided a valid, signed purchase agreement or original creditor documentation that establishes my legal responsibility for this account. 

In accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I am formally requesting validation of this debt, which should include the following : 1. A copy of the original contract or purchase agreement with my signature that demonstrates I am legally obligated to repay this debt.

2. A full accounting of the debt, including how the amount claimed was calculated, itemized statements, and any interest or fees that have been applied to the account.

3. A detailed record of all payments, charges, and adjustments made to the account, including the original balance and the breakdown of how the current balance was reached.

4. Proof that your company has the legal right to collect on this debt, including all assignment or sale agreements that show the chain of ownership from the original creditor to your company. 

Additionally, I have reason to believe that this debt may have been charged off by the original creditor. Under IRS guidelines, canceled debts over {$600.00} require a 1099-C form to be issued. To date, I have not received this form, which raises questions about whether this debt has already been forgiven or canceled. Please provide confirmation of whether the original creditor has charged off this debt, and why I have not been issued a 1099-C form. 

Furthermore, I would like clarification regarding the statute of limitations for this debt. Please confirm that this debt is still within the legal statute of limitations for collection in my state. If the statute of limitations has expired, I request that all collection efforts cease immediately and that any reporting of this debt to the credit bureaus be removed. 

I also want to highlight the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which governs the accuracy of information reported to credit bureaus. If you are reporting this debt to any credit reporting agencies without providing proper validation, it constitutes a violation of the FCRA. Therefore, if you are unable to provide the requested validation of this debt, I demand that all references to this account be removed from my credit report immediately. 

If you are unable to provide sufficient validation as outlined in this letter, I request the following actions : 1. Cease all collection activities related to this account.

2. Remove any references to this debt from my credit report with the major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). 
3. Provide written confirmation that this debt has been resolved and is no longer being pursued.

Failure to comply with these requests may result in my filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my state attorney generals office, as well as pursuing other legal remedies available to me. 

Please respond within 30 days of receipt of this letter with full validation of the debt or confirmation that the debt has been canceled and removed from my credit reports.",,Resurgent Capital Services L.P.,MS,386XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11067266

Recently, while pursuing the purchase of a home in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC, I encountered a concerning situation. The lending XXXX assigned to my case, XXXX, expressed interest in purchasing a home in the same community. This led to significant delays in my application process, ultimately leaving me feeling disregarded as a prospective buyer. 

Timeline of Events : Initial Visit to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX : My family and I visited the XXXX XXXX community to view the XXXX and XXXX models. We decided to pursue the XXXX home, with a completion date set for XX/XX/XXXX. During our meeting with XXXX, the on-site agent, she mentioned that XXXX, the XXXX lending officer, had expressed interest in the community and had recently ( same day as our meeting ) been in contact with her. Although this raised initial concerns, I was assured by XXXX. of XXXX professionalism. 

Delayed Communication : After reconnecting with XXXX. in XX/XX/XXXX to express interest in the XXXX XXXX XXXX, I experienced multiple delays in communication. My initial email was not acknowledged until five days later, at which point I was provided the wrong application link. Even after submitting the correct application, follow-ups with A.R. were sporadic. 

Concerns About Conflict of Interest : During a conversation to discuss numbers ( rate, mortgage, etc. ) with XXXX, he disclosed that he was personally interested in a home within XXXX XXXX, though he assured me it was not the XXXX model I was pursuing. Despite this reassurance, the process became increasingly opaque. 

Unanswered Questions and XXXX XXXX : Communication with both XXXX. and XXXX. abruptly ceased on XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed on the XXXX XXXX website that the XXXX home was no longer available and that the community had been closed. Neither A.R. nor XXXX. provided any update or explanation. 

Reflection on the Process : As a first-time homebuyer, this experience has been deeply frustrating and disappointing. The lack of transparency, professionalism, and accountability, combined with the potential conflict of interest, has left me questioning the integrity of NVR Mortgage and their affiliated agents. 

Why XXXX Sharing This : This account is not only a reflection of my personal experience but also a warning for others considering NVR Mortgage or XXXX XXXX. I urge potential buyers to approach with caution, ask thorough questions, and ensure that conflicts of interest are addressed upfront. 

While I am considering reporting this matter to the appropriate licensing authorities, I also hope that NVR Mortgage and XXXX XXXX take steps to ensure more ethical practices moving forward. First-time homebuyers deserve respect, transparency, and fairness throughout the process.

This account is improperly reported despite having GAP insurance coverage at the time of the loan termination. Additionally, this account was sold to another party, who is currently contacting me about additional money needed for a car that was totaled and resulted in a fire. This raises questions about the legitimacy of the debt and its continued reporting under applicable laws. 

Under 15 USC 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), I have the right to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information and demand an investigation. The continued reporting of this account, especially in light of the existence of GAP insurance and the sale of the debt, constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA. I request a thorough investigation to verify the accuracy of this entry and its compliance with legal standards. 

Furthermore, per 15 USC 1692g ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ), I am requesting validation of this debt, including the original contract, debt to contract request, proof of the amount claimed, and evidence of the debts transfer of ownership. As of now, I believe the reporting of this account violates my rights under the FDCPA. 

Additionally, I want to emphasize that continued attempts to collect on or report this account without proper validation may constitute violations of : 15 USC 1692e, prohibiting false, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with debt collection. 

15 USC 1681s-2, which holds furnishers accountable for reporting only accurate information to credit reporting agencies. 

I am requesting the following actions to be taken immediately : 1. Cease reporting this account on my credit report until the investigation is complete and validation has been provided.

2. Provide me with documentation substantiating the validity and legality of the debt and confirming compliance with GAP insurance coverage.

3. Remove this account from my credit report if it is found to be inaccurate or unverifiable.

4. Remove any late payments this account accused during the insurance cash out process. 

Please note that under the FCRA, you are required to respond to this dispute within 30 days. I expect written confirmation of your findings and any actions taken. If no response is received, or if the information is not properly corrected, I reserve the right to escalate this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and/or pursue legal remedies.

2024-12-07,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a complaint with Citibank. I have been with Citibank for several years now and have nothing if not outstanding accounts with this bank. I have two credit cards, both with very high limits as earned through loyalty, personal credit, and history with the bank. I always pay my credit cards in-full and on time each month. The checking accounts I had are closed now as you will see below, but they were open and with good standing as well until the past few months due to ongoing disputes with the bank. 

Last XXXX, XXXX, I sought a large personal loan of $ XXXX. As you can imagine, it is not easy to find a lender willing to give this amount of money. Through searching over months, I was able to locate a lender in XXXX. This lender is the XXXX  XXXX XXXX, which is the largest, and basically only bank in XXXX. This lender agreed to lend me the $ XXXX once all due diligences were paid. I first worked with the attorney of this transaction who secured from me roughly {$20000.00}. I then moved to the next step of due diligence on the loan which was roughly {$140000.00}. Ultimately, this turned out to be a scam. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is very real, but the impersonators offering the loan, unfortunately, are not. 

Before I paid any funds to the scam, I confirmed two things. One, I contacted a due diligence partner in XXXX who confirmed that everything looked legitimate from their offerings. I do not know this company other than they were recommended to me by a partner of mine in the XXXX. The second, and most important thing I did, was contact Citibank. I explained my concerns to them that in the case this is a scam, I need recourse. I suggested making payment through XXXX and let the funds hit my credit card or through my checking account, letting the funds hit my debit card. I was told on the phone, multiple times, that YES, if this funds hit a CARD, regardless which one, this would be traceable and I would be able to dispute the funds should an issue arise and receive full credit with documentation. 

Of course, making roughly {>= $1,000,000} in payments with credit card and debit card limits took several months. I paid the lenders diligently as you will see in the emails attached. Each day they asked me where to send the funds and for what amount as well as confirming the funds were received. Overall, this was over XXXX transactions to get these funds to the lender, but only a few XXXX accounts received the funds, as you will see in the emails attached. 

The moment I realized finally that this was a scam, I contacted Citibank. I filed all disputes on my credit cards online and called in for my checking account and spoke with a representative for almost two hours.

Once the disputes were filed, I sent all required information in. Citibank asked me to send as much documentation showing this was scam. There are roughly XXXX pages attached to this complaint, and all of these were sent to Citibank for all of the associated disputes. To date, I have received some of the funds back, several XXXX. But Citibank refuses to send the remaining amounts. Once I started getting letters on these disputes saying they could not get the funds back, I called Citibank. I was told that what I was missing is a slip saying the XXXX lender owed the funds back. I explained that I have sent the form showing that this lender in XXXX stated if I did not receive my funds, they would refund all of the {$160000.00}. This person was very patient and took time to review the file ( possibly the only person who reviewed the file ) and we found that the refund forms did not come through as they are yellow. So, I copied them on to white, resent, and the representative confirmed they came through. 

At this point, I thought nothing else could stand in the way of getting back the funds I was rightly owed. I received a few more refunds in my favor, was denied others, and others are still open. I called in again, and I was told that the person on the phone can only tell me that the case was denied, and some were approved. Each case has its own reviewer. I dont understand why this is done this way. Why would over XXXX cases have a different reviewer of XXXX pages? This seems like a large and inefficient process when ONE person could review and make a decision. The person on the phone told me that yes, the information I sent worked and I was awarded the funds back. So my question is, how is the information I sent enough for one or several of the disputes to be won in my favor, but not enough on the others? The charges are all the same, each person I was asked to pay is outlined in the emails. So, again, how could it work for one and not all if there is enough information? I do not think the denied cases took time to review my XXXX pages of detailed documentation showing this was a scam. For those who did review, I am appreciative, and again, that should apply to ALL cases. 

I have called Citibank several times to follow up and they tell me a different excuse each time. Either they say I will have an answer in 5 days and nothing comes. Or they say the case was denied and I received a letter which never came. The disputes are still open. I think Citibank is purposefully withholding these funds because of the amount although I confirmed with them that they would be able to get my funds back and you also can see they have allowed some of them back. Again, if they have enough documentation for some, they have enough for all disputes. 

An additional note - These charges were all given back as temporary charges and then removed as I understand how a dispute works. Except in the cases where these disputes were approved, all funds were charged back to me. In one instance, one of the charges caused my checking account to be withdrawn by {$2200.00}. I received a call from Citibank asking for the funds and I explained the full scenario. They were very pleasant on the phone and apologized and noted the file that I was working with the dispute department. About a month later, I started receiving calls again so I called them back. They noted the file again and stated all was well. A couple of days later the accounts were closed. Citibank closed my accounts and charged the accounts off after agreeing that they would not. 

In addition to my funds fully returned. I would like my accounts reinstated. 

Below is the latest email sent to Citi - Amount in Dispute - Total {$160000.00}, each transaction is {$4100.00} or {$3000.00} or {$2900.00} Name of Merchant - There are multiple merchants, including ( and most likely ) but not limited to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX. 

Please give a detailed explanation of the reason you are disputing this transaction - This information has all been emailed, over XXXX pages. However, I understand there are XXXX pages that can not be read and these are the confirmation pages stating they will refund my full {$160.00}. The first XXXX pages are the first time I asked for a guarantee and that amount was {$120000.00}. Therefore, I continued to send as requested. I once again asked for guarantee which is also attached here of ALL FUNDS paid of {$160000.00}. I have here the confirmation pages only as you should have the extensive XXXX pages of information and proof showing this is a scam. This interaction began on XX/XX/XXXX. I was contacted by XXXX XXXX through XXXX. XXXX introduced me to XXXX XXXX XXXX who was supposedly approving and securing a loan for me through the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX ) and the XXXX  which is XXXX of the largest lenders in XXXX. You will see in the email threads that I was asked to pay over {$160000.00}. I contacted Citi and asked the process for filing disputes against this vendor if needed which is why I chose to pay these through XXXX- to protect myself. In the previously sent documents, you will also see every single XXXX account I was asked to send money to, on which dates, and their confirmation of receiving the funds which correlates with the disputes you have received on these accounts. 

I have attached, again, the confirmation letter stating they would refund the full {$160000.00} to me. And they did not do so. 

Furthermore, please note that XXXX other disputes belonging to this same transaction of {$160000.00} have already been refunded in my favor. This a very large amount of money to be without, so I appreciate your haste and attention!

XXXX - Still says We received your documents in the Dispute Center. When I call, Citibank says I will have an answer with in 5 days. 

I am seeking every transaction be returned to me in my checking accounts and credit cares as there is ample documentation supporting my request. 

There is one charge I have not been able to dispute. This charge was on XX/XX/XXXX on credit card XXXX in the amount of {$1100.00}, which I would also like returned to me. 

I feel Citibank is deliberately not reviewing the open cases and is pushing me around until a magical date. This is not only unethical, but seems highly illegal. Please review this case and remedy the results of my funds back into my accounts. Additionally, I would like interest on this amount. My XXXX XXXX accounts, similar to the offering of Citibank is paying an APY of 3.90 %. Being that Citibank is deliberately withholding these funds, I would like interest of {$6500.00} paid as well.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I logged on to the Mr Cooper website to make a payment, and the MONTHLY PAYMENT schedule listed the AMOUNT DUE as {$1300.00}. My account overview lists the INTEREST BEARING PRINCIPAL BALANCE as {$1200.00}, less than the monthly loan amount set by Mr Cooper. 

When I tried to make a payment for XX/XX/XXXX, the website instructed me to make the payment for LESS THAN {$1100.00}. I made a "" partial payment '' of {$1000.00}. on XXXX. Mr Cooper HAS NOT APPLIED this payment to my mortgage balance, so my principal balance remains the same, and Mr Cooper has not subtracted the partial payment I made of {$1000.00} from my principal balance. 

Furthermore, I was charged a LATE PAYMENT fee of {$24.00}. 

I have repeatedly called Mr Cooper to try to rectify this accounting error, but have only encountered artificial intelligence. Do any HUMAN BEINGS work at Mr Cooper? 

Additionally, I am getting automated phone messages from Mr Cooper telling me that my mortgage payments are overdue ( I am XXXX ahead of schedule! ) and that they are a debt collector. 

A XXXX billing from Mr Cooper has added on an additional month 's payment due, now RAISING the amount they are billing me to {$2500.00}.

I applied for and was approved for the credit card the same day, with a credit limit of over {$5000.00}, intending to finance the fence project. At no point during the consultation, nor within the contract I signed, was I informed that a 60 % cancellation fee would apply after the expiration of a three-day grace period. The amount of this fee totals {$3500.00}. 



On XX/XX/year>, I contacted XXXX XXXX of THD XXXX to inquire about the status of the fence permit and was advised that the permit was under review. 



On XX/XX/year>, I sent an email to XXXX, inquiring about the possibility of canceling the installation. 



On XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX, Director of Operations at THD XXXX, responded to my inquiry, acknowledging my desire to understand the cancellation process. 



XXXX XXXX explained that cancellation at this stage would incur a fee of {$3500.00}, as certain processes, such as the submission of permit documents, the engagement of a permit runner, and the preparation of surveys and engineered drawings, had already begun. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX informed me that the city does not allow the installation of a privacy fence in the front yard of my property, and only wind-flow fencing no higher than XXXX feet tall would be permitted. She offered to provide a revised quote for this alternative fencing option, and mentioned a promotional 5 % discount. However, she reiterated that cancellation at this stage would result in a {$3500.00} fee, which would be charged under the permitting stage. 



As of XX/XX/year>, the city in which I reside has not granted the permit for the XXXX privacy fence I originally requested, and no materials have been purchased for the installation of the fence. Not even a nail. 



While I understand that my desired fence style is not permitted by the city, I find it unacceptable that Home Depots trusted service provider, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, is forcing me to either accept a different fence style that I do not want or pay a {$3500.00} cancellation fee. Both options are unreasonable and inequitable. 



Home Depot and THD fencing have been installing fences in XXXX for years. I on the other hand, have been living in XXXX for only 4 months. I trusted Home Depots expertise in choosing a reputable XXXX for my fencing needs in the XXXX XXXX area. I have family who worked for Home Depot for years, rave about how great of a company it is. And now, I deeply regret this decision and feel like the attorney general should investigate how Home Depot is taking advantage of customers by allowing third parties such as THD XXXX, to scam American homeowners out of their money. 



XXXX said she looked online and saw that our fence style is not permitted. If she simply looked online to find this important information, how does looking something up online cost XXXX. If this information is so easily accessible, why didnt Home Depot explain this to me the day they initially sent THD fencing to my home? Why am I as a consumer, given merely 3 days to cancel or a XXXX cancellation penalty for alleged permit runners and engineers? The fence was for a town home in XXXX XXXX not the XXXX XXXX. What kind of fence permit process totals XXXX? 



I respectfully requested that Home Depot intervene in this matter and instruct its service provider to reduce the cancellation fee to a more reasonable amount, preferably below 5 % of the total project cost. Furthermore, I requested that any charges made to my Home Depot Consumer Credit Card in connection with this project be reversed. The order number associated with the fence installation is XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and the last four digits of my Consumer Citi Bank Credit Card are XXXX. As of XX/XX/year> they reduced the cancellation fee to XXXX. This is still crippling, deceptive, and unreasonable. 
I am paying a XXXX cancellation fee on a citi bank credit card. As a consumer this fee is highly over inflated. The extreme cancellation fee wasnt even in the contract I signed with Home Depot. The penalty fee was very vague. This company did not do XXXX worth of work. Taking measurements of a townhouse yard and filing permit paperwork doesnt cost XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",FL,33055,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11068956

However, after reviewing your response and the enclosed copy of my Master Promissory Note ( MPN ), I must address several points that remain unresolved or inadequately addressed : Legal Authority and Loan Discharge Eligibility You stated that my loans are governed by the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( HEA ), as amended, and that I am obligated to repay in full unless eligible for discharge under a specific provision. However : Please provide a comprehensive list of all discharge provisions applicable to loans issued under Part [ B/D ], Title IV of the HEA.

Explain how these provisions specifically apply to my current circumstances.

Additionally, while referencing my Master Promissory Note ( MPN ), your response did not establish sufficient grounds to validate the debt as required by 15 U.S.C. 1692g.

Debt Validation Requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1692g Your response failed to address my explicit request for debt validation as required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Specifically, you did not : Provide clear documentation demonstrating the original creditor 's claim or unbroken chain of servicing rights.

Verify the debt with an itemized breakdown of the balance, including principal, interest, and fees.

Offer certified evidence supporting the legitimacy of the debt and your authority to service it.

Until full validation is provided, continued collection activity or reporting of this debt may constitute a violation of federal law.

Clarification of Compliance with Consumer Protection Laws As a federal loan servicer, you are required to comply with all provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, alongside the HEA.

Ombudsman Escalation Process While I acknowledge the option to escalate to the Ombudsman Group, I am seeking resolution directly from your office at this stage. Please confirm your willingness to address my concerns fully before escalation becomes necessary. 

Payment and Plan Adjustments Your letter suggested alternative repayment plans, but I request additional clarification : Provide the exact steps to transition to an XXXX  plan under current forbearance conditions. 
Include a timeline for processing and implementation once an application is submitted. 
Additional Information Requested As outlined in my initial letter, I request the following : A complete copy of my consumer file related to this account. 
A certified copy of the original agreement between myself and the lender, with supporting documentation from the Department of Education verifying your authority to service the loan. 
A notarized affidavit certifying the accuracy of the information being reported. 
Tender of Payment and UCC 3-603 In your response, you stated that I am obligated to pay the loan in "" legal U.S. tender. '' It is important to highlight the provisions of UCC 3-603, which govern the tender of payment : Tender and Discharge of Obligations : If I tender payment of my obligation and it is refused by the person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligation is discharged to the extent of the amount tendered.

Discharge of Interest : If I tender the amount due on the loan, the obligation to pay interest on the tendered amount after the due date is discharged.

Presentment Requirements : As the obligor, if I am ready and able to pay at the due date but payment is refused, I am deemed to have tendered payment.

This raises critical questions : If a tender of payment were made, would you accept or refuse it?

What specific actions have you taken to ensure compliance with UCC provisions regarding tender and discharge?

I request that you clarify your stance on this matter and provide documentation showing compliance with UCC 3-603 in handling payment obligations.

Next Steps This letter serves as both a rebuttal to your prior response and a formal reiteration of my original request. Please ensure that all requested documentation and explanations are provided within XXXX  days of receipt of this letter. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in formal disputes, additional complaints to the CFPB, and potential legal action to enforce my rights under federal law. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your timely and comprehensive response.",,EdFinancial Services,CA,94591,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11070901

2024-12-07,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Fees or costs after closing,"Summary : NewRez ( mortgage servicer ) owes me a {$720.00} refund due to duplicate property tax payments being made to XXXX XXXX ( Arizona ). 

NewRez was my mortgage servicer for a property I purchased on XXXX. 

Due to interest rates dropping, I refinanced that property ( close date of the refinance : XX/XX/scrub>XXXX ), causing my mortgage servicer to change from NewRez to XXXXXXXX XXXX 

Property taxes for XXXX XXXX were due on XXXX 

In relation to purely the refinance ( separate from NewRez ), XXXX XXXX is the title company that insured and disbursed the funds for my refinance transaction for XXXX XXXX. On 1XXXX XXXX XXXX received a {$720.00} payment that cleared from XXXX XXXX to pay the property taxes due on XXXX {$720.00} was the full amount owed in property taxes. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XXXX  called the XXXX XXXX XXXX collector and the County confirmed that the payment received on XXXX  was from XXXX XXXX XXXX. These funds were taken from my refinance closing costs ( image of the Property tax section in my "" Other Costs '' section of my refinance docs attached ). I've also attached a screenshot of confirmation of these events from XXXX XXXX - confirming the XXXX XXXX  stated the property tax payment received on XXXX was from XXXX XXXX  not NewRez.

NewRez ( my previous servicer ) on XXXX took {$720.00} out of my escrow account ( as on XXXX  they were still my mortgage servicer - as of the next day XXXX they were not ) and automatically sent out that amount to XXXX XXXX  even though those funds had already been sent by XXXX XXXX  due to the refinance ; hence, the duplicate payment. ( Attachment of my escrow account balance showing the deduction is attached ).

When XXXX XXXX looked into this matter ( to determine if XXXX XXXX  or NewRez made the duplicate payment ) and contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  stated the County stated they received a 2nd payment in the amount of {$720.00} on XXXX. This 2nd payment was rejected as the payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had already been cleared and received on XXXX ( this was confirmed by XXXX XXXX  ). The 2nd payment could only have been made from NewRez ( as no other payment was made by XXXX XXXX  ) and was the amount taken from my escrow account.

To clarify, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX paid {$720.00} in property taxes owed to XXXX XXXX out of my refinance closing costs which cleared on XXXX. NewRez took {$720.00} out of my preexisting escrow account on XXXX which cleared on XXXX to pay XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX rejected the 2nd payment of property taxes made by NewRez as they had already received the funds from my new title ( XXXX XXXX ). This 2nd payment made by NewRez was a "" duplicate '' tax payment but still taken from my escrow account and has not been refunded to me.

I've contacted NewRez for 2+ months to refund me the {$720.00} taken out of my escrow account and I have only been passed around to various representatives. I have not received confirmation that I would receive a refund despite it being explicitly clear that an excess payment was made on NewRez 's behalf and that I am owed the {$720.00} taken out of my escrow account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",AZ,85268,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11068716

2024-12-07,Checking or savings account,CD (Certificate of Deposit),Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"Approximately two years ago, I opened a {$10000.00} CD account with CIT Bank, XXXX, CA in response to an internet ad. All communications with CIT have been over the internet or by telephone. 

Communicating with CIT is difficult. My experience is that it can take up to an hour to reach CIT personnel by telephone.

Internet communication is, also, difficult. In addition to entering a User ID and Password ( both of which are stored in my computer ), upon entry of the foregoing, CIT requires that I authorize a text to me of a Code to ( presumably ) a telephone number maintained by it.

The telephone number that CIT has on-file was not supplied by me and has no relation to me.

This incorrect number has been on file since the account was first opened and CIT has refused numerous requests from me that my correct telephone number ( XXXX ) be inserted in its records. 

The result is that it is not practical for me to monitor the content of my account - getting access requires at least one telephone call to CIT ( which can take up to an hour ) and undergoing a cumbersome telephone number resetting.

CIT routinely sends communications - other than those dealing with renewals - to me by email.

Communications regarding renewals are, according to CIT, archived in my on-line account, which I can not readily access. 

Over a year ago, I informed CIT in writing not to renew my CD because their renewal rates were not attractive.

CIT now refuses to send the entire proceeds of my account to me.",,"FIRST CITIZENS BANCSHARES, INC.",NC,287XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-13,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11053284

in XXXX I had a XXXX flood event, which hit my insurance company limits and I had to use own funds and credit cards to work on repairs. 
in XXXX my company made a XXXX time adjustment to my compensation which lowered my XXXX W2 by close to $ XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a request to Freedom Mortgage to enter forbearance, to allow me time to pay off the consumer debt I incurred working on flood repairs to my house. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I found out through the Freedom mortgage website that they put me in a "" modified payment plan '' lowering my payment for XXXX months and then doubling my payment for XXXX  months to catch up. That did not meet my request and didn't provide any assistance. 
in XX/XX/XXXX I resubmitted my hardship request and asked for any options available to me ( forbearance, loan mod, reinstatement ). Without discussing with me, Freedom Mortgage sent me a loan mod package, increasing the interest rate almost 3 % and raising my payment substantially. That didn't offer assistance I needed. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I re-submitted a hardship request again asking for somebody to contact me to discuss options and I explained the previous loan mod was not an acceptable option as it offered no relief. XXXX again without discussing with me sent another similar loan mod as the first XXXX ( raising the rate substantially and not offering any assistance ). Throughout the entirety from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX I have not been able to reach anybody at Freedom Mortgage with the authority to discuss options and was only able to reach general customer service representatives that simply "" read notes '' in the system and could provide very limited information. A few times through those XXXX  months I would receive a missed call ( while I was at work ) and a voice mail that asked me to call them back but no information. When I called back again I'd only reach customer service and was not able to get put through to the person that left the voice mail. 
In XXXX of XXXX Freedom sent a process server to post a Notice of Sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. I called and re-submitted a hardship request in XX/XX/XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I had multiple calls with Freedom Mortgage customer service as they kept telling me "" there was a title issue and they needed to know if my wife would be signing any documents required '' I verbally confirmed she would be if required. XXXX weeks later I called and they said there was still the same title issue and so I sent a written confirmation through their website portal. XXXX XX/XX/XXXX customer service told me they received my written confirmation and that they were "" waiting '' for title to clear. 
On XX/XX/XXXX customer service told me that my hardship package was in underwriting as of XX/XX/XXXX and that the sales date was put on hold. I confirmed on the website that my account was in loss mitigation on the XXXX. 
on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating there was a "" change in the status of my account '' I was traveling on business at the time in XXXX XXXX, IA. I logged into my account and the status said "" active in foreclosure ''. I called and the customer service rep told me that my file was kicked out of loss mitigation on XX/XX/XXXX and that the sale for the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) was going forward. I asked for immediate relief/postponement and for somebody to help me and work on a resolution. The rep told me "" it's too late. There's nothing you can do ''. That entire XXXX months I worked in good faith to reach a resolution and met nothing but roadblocks through the business processes of Freedom Mortgage, not having access to anybody with authority or detailed knowledge to assist me. 
on XX/XX/XXXX while still traveling in XXXX XXXX, IA I listed the house for sale and received an offer on it. My realtor submitted that information to the trustee for Freedom Mortgage.

Given these circumstances, I respectfully request an investigation to clarify the following : Was an interest-free repayment letter sent to my home? If so, when was it sent, and to what address? 
A comprehensive review of the payments I made on the reverse mortgage loan to determine how much interest was paid that could have been avoided under interest-free terms. 
A review of the documents I signed when initiating the reverse mortgage loan, as I am concerned about the possibility of irregularities or misrepresentation in the documentation.

We had made numerous requests via a Qualified Written Request to XXXX XXXX, all ignored. We offered to make payments in good faith while his issue was being addressed, but they never responded.

They claimed they could not provide the complete loan history nor amortization since it was not in their possession. They placed all their weight on Modification Agreement signed under duress and noted in writing that it was disputed when signed.

Furthermore, the mortgage holder had filed a fraudulent proof of claim with the bankruptcy court, voiding our rights to protection.

Since XX/XX/year>, I have been mailing dispute letters to Equifax regarding this inaccurate account. As of XX/XX/year>, it has been over five months without resolution, despite the FCRA stipulating that credit bureaus must conduct an investigation within 30 days. Equifax has continued to stall my requests by sending me delay letters, which is unacceptable. 

Furthermore, I would like to draw attention to Section 2 of the FCRA, which states that a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer. Both the financial institution involved and Equifax do not have my consent to furnish this information, nor do they possess any written consent from me. This lack of authorization raises serious concerns about the legality of the information being reported. 

I urge the CFPB to investigate this matter and hold Equifax accountable for their actions. I appreciate your attention to this serious issue and look forward to your prompt response.

I needed to understand why my interest rates keep going up even though I've been paying my loans consistently over the last year, and what my repayment options were due to being laid off. 

In terms of the interest rates, I was not given an answer. In fact, the customer service rep lied to me about my rates going down. Around XXXX years ago, XXXX of my loans was at 10 % interest ; it's now at 13.75 %, and I've already paid beyond the initial amount borrowed by over double. It's very clear that 13.75 % is higher than 10 %. I was not given an answer other than "" we can raise rates whenever we want. '' I find this to be an abusive and deceptive practice and violates UDAP laws. 

When I asked what my repayment options were, the customer service rep refused to give me information on what my options were unless I gave information first. This is also a deceptive practice. In addition, while dealing with this customer service rep, she raised her voice, spoke over me numerous times, and was outright rude and unfair. When I explained that I didn't need to provide information about my income or savings account, I was told that they were going to withhold from telling me their options. This is also UDAP violation, abusive and deceptive, as I was trying to understand what my options were to remain a good paying customer. I never got an answer from this rep. Even when speaking with their supervisor, I was not provided with what all the options were without providing my expense information, which is withholding and being deceptive about what I could do while facing financial hardship. 

Further, I've already paid beyond the principal of my loans at this point and likely will not be able to get out of these loans throughout my lifetime because they continuously increase interest rates without providing a reason.

2024-12-07,Debt collection,I do not know,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"Portfolio Recovery Associates XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : Formal Demand for Assignment Contract and Validation of Debt for Accounts # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Dear Portfolio Recovery Associates, This letter serves as a formal demand for documentation validating your legal right to collect on the following accounts currently reported to my consumer report : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : Balance {$870.00} Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g, you are required to provide clear and sufficient validation of the alleged debts. Specifically, I demand the assignment contract proving your legal authority to collect on these accounts. A bill of sale or billing statements alone do not constitute sufficient proof of ownership or assignment.

Legal Basis for My Request : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) : Upon disputing the validity of a debt, the debt collector must provide verification. Verification requires substantive proof, including the assignment contract that demonstrates the transfer of ownership or the right to collect the debt. A generic bill of sale or billing statements are insufficient, as they do not establish your right to enforce the debt.

Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) 9-404 ( Rights Acquired by Assignee ) : Under the UCC, you must provide the original contract and proof that you acquired the rights to enforce the debt. If you lack such documentation, your claim to these debts is invalid. 
Federal Trade Commission XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : In this case, it was affirmed that debt collectors must possess and provide evidence of a legal transfer of ownership or assignment to collect on debts.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : Furnishers of information, including debt buyers, are prohibited from reporting information they know or should know to be inaccurate. Reporting debts without sufficient legal documentation violates this provision. 
Specific Documentation Required : Assignment Contract : Provide a copy of the assignment contract explicitly showing the transfer of ownership or the right to collect the debts from the original creditor to Portfolio Recovery Associates. 
XXXX Signed XXXX : Provide a copy of the original signed agreement between myself and the original creditor to establish the validity of the alleged debts. 
Purchase Amount : The purchase amount Portfolio Recovery Associates paid for these accounts must be disclosed to ensure transparency regarding ownership and collection practices.

Payment History and Balance Verification : A full and detailed account of the payment history, including how the balances were calculated, must be provided. This includes verification that the claimed balances are accurate and free from errors or inflated amounts.

Demand for Removal from My Consumer Report : If you can not provide the above documentation, it is clear you do not have the legal authority to collect on these accounts. As such, I demand that these accounts be immediately removed from all consumer reporting agencies to avoid further violations of the FDCPA and FCRA.

Failure to Comply : Failure to comply with this request will result in : Filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for violations of the FDCPA and FCRA.

This {$5800.00} was moved from Wells Fargo to XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX which I was told that it was a sub account of XXXX XXXX whom I was supposed to be hired by. The fraud immediately was detected after the first weekend following the wire transfers. That Monday following the incident, an account notice was placed by Wells Fargo as I notified them on the fraudulent activity and a new checking account was opened. Wells Fargo has been notified of fraud by phone. A month later in XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX showed a payment processing from the newly made checking account. Wells Fargo was notified to not accept the charge from XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo said they placed a note that the chargeback from XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX was unauthorized. The unauthorized chargeback from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX went through and depleted my account into the negatives.I have been trying to refund my initial checking balance of {$1300.00} from the {$5800.00} that the scammers defrauded Wells Fargo through my account. My account has since been closed by Wells Fargo and my credit card of over 10years with over XXXX credit limit closed as well due to this mess. Since then, I placed a police report and formal complaints with Wells Fargo and through CFPB to gain resolution to this problem. It was been over a year since my initial dispute. Wells Fargo contacted me yesterday about the negative balance they want me to pay back. As far as I am concerned, Wells Fargo actually owes me the {$1300.00} that they took back in XX/XX/year> when they allowed XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX to pull {$5800.00} that was labeled and noted as an unauthorized charge. I strictly told them to put a stop to the charge and what would happen If Wells Fargo allowed the charge to go through from them. Had Wells Fargo listened, then I would have had to deal directly with the neighboring Credit Union relinquishing any liability from Wells Fargo and initially myself. Since they allowed the unauthorized charges to go through to the new checking account I created, we all now have to solve this overly complicated Fraud case. I can not be liable for the full amount as I am covered, as a consumer, by federal law given that i reported the Fraud and took all the necessary steps within 3 days. I called Wells Fargo Fraud Department to file a new claim and no one was available when they transferred my call. The initial agent who was asking for the remaining {$4000.00} said that I needed to place a police report on the Fraud which i have done 2 years prior to now.

2024-12-07,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"I had to file an insurance claim, and when my insurance sent me a check to reimburse me for my claim, they made the check out to me and my loan servicer, Newrez. I endorsed the check with my signature and then contacted Newrez to see what I needed them to do to have them endorse it. 

Newrez sent me instructions to send them the check by snail mail, that they would endorse it and send it back to me by snail mail. I let them know that that was not a good idea, because I already signed it. Their uneducated and uniformed service department proceeded to tell me that I could send them a XXXX mailing label ( they don't do XXXX ), so that they could send the check back to me more securely. 

There are MANY problems with this response. 
XXXX. Why do I have to send them a label? They're servicing my loan at a ridiculous interest rate, so they should probably have the money to make their own XXXX label, which is MUCH easier for them to do than me. Why should I pay for their business fees? 
XXXX. XXXX may track with the label, but that still doesn't insure the package. It's a XXXX check! For me to pay for the insurance on this label, XXXX wanted to charge me over {$80.00}. 
XXXX. Their answer should have been that they would deposit my check and then make out another check to me, sending me that check. This is the only secure way to do this. 

I called them back, and it took me a LOT of explaining for me to even get the person on the other line to understand that I already signed this check, and that once they signed it, it would be fully endorsed. Once the other person finally got it, I told them they needed to deposit this check and send me a new one. She said that she put a note on the account asking them to do that, and that they would. 

Today I opened my mailbox to find an envelope from Newrez. Inside is the fully enorsed check from my home insurance company, not a new check from Newrez. After multiple phone calls, making a formal complaint to Newrez, and assurance that they would make out a new check to me, these idiots put a fully endorsed check for almost {$10000.00} in the mail. I'm lucky to have this check right now and that nothing happened to it.

Also, my underwriter has stated that I have been financially stable to have paid my equity loan ballooned interest rates since XX/XX/XXXX while unemployed until XX/XX/XXXX, started a new Job for 40 days before enduring another hardship from XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX with an dealership and insurance company review process of how to claim or not claim a car repair. I had to cover my own transportation without my car to work and maintain my conservator trial period. All of these situations were occurring under a failed Wells Fargo Home Preservation Application late XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ; after the receipt of my paystubs, home insurance, and XXXX  tax returns that didn't reflect a filed Schedule C. My licensed CPA did not file this form because it wasn't a source of income for me. Wells Fargo underwriter denied my application based upon this missing information and my home preservation specialist refused all of my inquiries from about my process from XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. My home was placed into Foreclosure courts around XX/XX/XXXX with non-delinquent taxes and mortgage loan but a ballooned equity loan after gaining interest since XX/XX/XXXX under 2 denied mortgage assistance attempts and over 100 escalations, countless ignored Wells Fargo bank manager customer support inquiries, 10 Wells Fargo preservation specialists, {$30000.00} loss of income, 5 denied request for a New Underwriter, and 3 stated household Hardships. 

My 2nd loan modification application, XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo underwriter refused because of my new work contract that was implemented XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  gross not net income. My XXXX  and XXXX  hardships were completely a non-factor and a short sale letter was forced before my appeal form. Why am I being held to shoulder such unrealistic financial recovery process because Wells Fargo underwriter could not create an additional {$400.00} income from My 17 months of Hardship after national rates increased? Packing my file with false financial claims of a Missing Tax Form and more income during 3 major hardships is just unethical to take my home. My checking account was never released or requested for a true review of my financial of one source of income. Also, my neighbor received a foreclosure notice for my home XXXX weeks ago. As a 30 year loyal customer to Wells Fargo, I am still begging for a fair justifiable review and support with this equity loan while still maintaining a Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and Property taxes for my home. This home helps me support better health care services for several family members, too. 
I am very heartbroken over this entire process while continuing to believe that Wells Fargo doesn't want me to lose my home since XXXX, lost of 2 parents, frozen government salaries, Recession, Pandemic, and maintaining a public school career. I can't afford to lose my home as hard as I have worked and adjusted my life to keep it while being a loyal Wells Fargo Customer. 

-- -- -- -- -- Forwarded message -- -- -- -- - Date : Fri, XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : Re : Auto reply from Wells Fargo Board Communications To : XXXX To Whom It My Concern : Since my XX/XX/XXXX appeal to the poorly executed review of my financial, the home preservation office attempted to report that I did not pay my taxes. My county has never submitted an delinquent tax statement. This was a spiteful attempt after being informed that my taxes were paid while awaiting Wells Fargo Home Preservation Office support. The home preservation office claims it wants to help me keep my home but has an attorney filing Foreclosure Sales before my 45 Days to appeal on an equity loan not a mortgage. The mortgage has not and still not delinquent. The home preservation office has delayed for over 12 months to not service me through 3 hardships since XX/XX/XXXX and prior to the unreasonable XXXX tax increases on the equity loan, as a 30 year customer of Wells Fargo. 
Continued stalling Reviews that increase your interest rates with Wells Fargo. No review being conducted. They are just stalling me to exponentially grow my interest rate back and increase the value of my home equity loan. They don't provide their customers with hone preservation services.

Below are the discrepancies that need to be corrected : Inconsistent Account Status Reporting : XXXX reports the account status as "" Positive '', while XXXX lists it as "" Negative '', and XXXX lists it as "" Closed ''. This inconsistency causes confusion regarding the status of the account, and it is crucial that the information is aligned across all credit bureaus. 
Under FCRA Section 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the information in consumer credit reports. The conflicting status reports violate this requirement and need to be corrected. 
Discrepancies in Account Type Reporting : XXXX lists the account as a Secured loan, while XXXX and XXXX do not include this detail. This inconsistency could affect how this account is viewed by lenders or creditors. Under FCRA Section 1681c, all information reported must accurately reflect the nature of the account. The discrepancy in account type reporting must be corrected to ensure transparency and avoid confusion in credit assessments. 
Discrepancy in Last Activity Date : XXXX and XXXX list the last activity date as XX/XX/year>, while XXXX lists it as XX/XX/year>. These discrepancies could affect the aging of this account, potentially impacting its removal or continued reporting. Under FCRA Section 1681c, negative information must be removed after seven years from the date of last activity. The conflicting last activity dates could result in incorrect aging, violating this regulation. 
Inconsistent Payment Status and Account Reporting : The account is reported with conflicting statuses between bureaus. XXXX lists the account as "" Open '' and "" Current '', while XXXX and XXXX report it as "" Closed '' with varying payment statuses. This inconsistency misrepresents the accounts standing and could affect my creditworthiness. Under FCRA Section 1681i, when a consumer disputes information, it must be investigated and corrected if found to be inaccurate. The discrepancies in payment status across the credit bureaus suggest inaccurate reporting and should be rectified. 
Request for Never Late Update : If this account has been consistently paid and has not been late, I request that the account be updated to reflect "" Never Late '' status across all bureaus. The discrepancies in reporting have led to negative consequences for my credit, which is preventing me from securing a mortgage for my family. 
Legal Reference : Under FCRA Section 1681i, consumers have the right to request corrections to inaccuracies. If the account is reported inaccurately or misleadingly, it should be updated to reflect "" Never Late '' status.

Given these discrepancies, I respectfully request that this account be updated to reflect a Never Late status across all bureaus, and that any conflicting or inaccurate information be corrected to align across XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. These errors are significantly affecting my ability to purchase a home, and I request that they be resolved promptly in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

2024-12-07,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","Previous mortgage company was XXXX XXXX, owned the contract for 7 years, sold the contract to PennyMac XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my newer mortgage company stating their records show my condo unit insurance expired XX/XX/XXXX and will require evidence to show new coverage obtained. My actual Insurance policy didnt fully expire until XX/XX/XXXX. I provided the correct policy information and on XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from the mortgage company verifying that policy information was received and account updated. However the mortgage company still failed to pay the policy from the escrow account before the expiration on XX/XX/XXXX, resulting in loss of my condo insurance policy, which was never communicated until I received another letter on XX/XX/XXXX stating that my insurance expired and evidence of new coverage will be required, again. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a water leak occurred and damaged my unit, resulting in {$15000.00} worth of damage ( first estimate, no work has yet to be performed ). Drywall, cabinets and flooring had to be removed to fix a riser pipe. The HOAs master insurance covered the pipe and structure repair, however I am left to cover the damage to my own personal property. I called my insurance company only to find out that my policy expired due to non payment, and that they would not reinstate my policy. I called the mortgage company and they informed me to purchase new insurance and that they will have lender placed insurance to cover from XX/XX/XXXX until my new policy takes effect. I shopped for insurance and was unable to receive any policys due to lapse in coverage, a previous claim in the past 7 months prior and the loss of most insurance companies refusing to insure in the state of California.

I called the mortgage company back informing them in my inability to receive insurance. I requested to purchase the lender placed coverage from them on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that it would be purchased and go into effect on XX/XX/XXXX and will cover from XXXX. I waited the month to make a claim only to find out on XX/XX/XXXX that they didnt not purchase the lender placed coverage as requested and now stated because the HOA has a master policy, they didnt require me to provide insurance with my mortgage. I informed them that the HOAs policy was to cover the structure and not my personal living space. The master policy shows that its all inclusive to the structure, not my personal living space. I even emailed the HOA who verified that I would have a {$25000.00} deductible and that it wouldnt cover anything other than the drywall. 

I called again and was informed that the lender placed wouldnt cover the water damage either and that I should try to purchase government sponsored insurance which is way more expensive and still wouldnt cover any future water damage. I feel like there has been so much negligence on behalf of my new mortgage company and Im getting left to pay for it. My previous mortgage company paid on time without issues for the past 7 years. My insurance covered water damage multiple times in the past 7 years without issue. Now the first year of my new mortgage company owning my contract I lose my policy and stuck with the {$15000.00} bill.",,"PENNYMAC LOAN SERVICES, LLC.",CA,92081,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11068425

I was reassured I would have access to that information. The recruiter started my process and assured me I would be able to jump right into the program due to the already accumulated classes and meeting program pre requisitions. The financial cost will be affordable because I wouldn't require many classes and I could get fees waved. After speaking to enrollment, I voiced the same concerns I had with the recruiter. I was assured this program would be cost effective. I was still eligible the option for federal loans that would cover the program but I did not have any PELL GRANTS available.

I remember the vehicle was initially towed due to judgment tickets. After recovering the vehicle from the impound for the judgment tickets, I was approximately 8991 days past due on the lease. Within a week of retrieving the vehicle, it was repossessed that evening. 

After the repossession, I contacted Infiniti Financial Services to explore my options for recovering the vehicle. Over the following weeks, I communicated with several customer service representatives, providing updates on my situation and discussing payment options. It wasnt until later in XX/XX/year> that I spoke to one representative and informed him I would be following up with a payment I was planning to send to Infiniti. 

After sending the payment, I reached out to them the following Monday. During that conversation, one representative informed me that I was still behind on the past-due amount. I explained to him that the payment I had sent the previous week covered the full amount required to recover the vehicle. However, after going back and forth with the representative, I requested to speak with a supervisor. 

I spoke with the supervisor for at least two hours as she reviewed the account notes. After thoroughly reviewing everything, she told me that I should have been able to recover the vehicle with the payment I had sent the prior week. I explained to her that the representative I spoke to earlier had not communicated this to me and had instead told me that I needed to send an additional payment. He also stated that the vehicle was scheduled to be auctioned off by a certain date. 

Hearing my frustration, the supervisor asked me to hold while she consulted her higher-ups to see if there was any way to release the vehicle. After waiting for 2030 minutes, she returned with unfortunate news. She explained that the vehicle had already been moved to the auction site, and although I was technically eligible to recover it, there was nothing further she or her superiors could do at that point.

While I authorized this purchase, I have not received the item as described, and the handling of my case appears to have overlooked key details. 

Here is a summary of my concerns : 1.After my initial dispute, the merchant provided a XXXX tracking number to Wells Fargo but did not share it directly with me. 

2.When I disputed again, the merchant eventually sent me a XXXX tracking number along with a blurry image of a used XXXX shoe box with newspaper from XXXX, which is entirely inconsistent with my purchase. My purchase was a XXXX XXXX bag. 

3.Despite these issues, the bank has repeatedly stated that my dispute was based on an unauthorized transaction and non-receipt of goods. While I did claim non-receipt, I clearly stated that the transaction was authorized but the item I paid for was not delivered. 

The merchants submission of a generic XXXX tracking number does not address the core issue that the goods delivered ( if any ) are not the items I purchased. 
To assist with the reinvestigation, I have attached the following evidence : The XXXX tracking details and the image provided by the merchant.

I contacted a Wells Fargo customer service representative on XX/XX/XXXX regarding my first overdraft fee and was informed of a recent change to their overdraft fee policy. This change, implemented in early XXXX, limited fee reimbursement to one transaction type per account per service year. This directly impacted how fees are assessed on my account.

I received no prior notice about this change. In the past, Wells Fargo has always informed me of policy changes, such as the introduction of the extra grace day for overdrawn accounts. In this case, I was blindsided, leading to a cascade of overdraft fees as I tried to catch up financially. Over XXXX months, I accrued XXXX overdraft fees totaling $ XXXX amount equivalent to my bi-weekly paycheck. 

When I escalated the issue, I was told I had been informed during prior calls that I would not be eligible for further fee returns. However, I was not informed. I am now homeless and struggling to recover. 

I noticed I was partially credited after the fact, on XX/XX/XXXX, but I'm unsure why it wasn't a full reimbursement. This is extremely weird behavior, especially after stating that I wasn't entitled to any refund, including partially.

2024-12-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am writing to formally dispute the reporting of an auto repossession on my credit report under account PNC BANK. This account was previously removed from my XXXX credit file, which demonstrates that the information is either inaccurate, unverifiable, or incomplete. Also, this account is being inaccurately reported for the full loan amount instead of reflecting the proper deficiency balance after the vehicle was sold at auction, as required by law. Furthermore, I was not provided with a required notice detailing the auction results and the remaining balance, which further invalidates the accuracy of this reporting. Therefore, I am requesting that you immediately investigate and remove this account from my credit file as required by federal law. 

Under 15 USC 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and consistent records. Disparities in reporting across the XXXX major bureaus call into question the accuracy of the information being furnished and your adherence to your duty under the FCRA to ensure maximum accuracy in consumer credit reports ( 15 USC 1681e ( b ) ). Credit bureaus must report only accurate, complete, and verifiable information. Reporting the full loan amount after a repossession and sale violates this standard of accuracy. 

UCC 9-611 and 9-616 ( Uniform Commercial Code ) : Creditors are required to notify the borrower in writing of the time and place of the auction or sale of repossessed collateral ( 9-611 ). Additionally, after the sale, the creditor must provide an explanation of how the proceeds were applied, including the deficiency balance ( 9-616 ). Failure to provide this notice invalidates the debt or the claimed deficiency amount.

Additionally, the failure to verify the accuracy of this account may also constitute a violation of 15 USC 1681i, which requires prompt reinvestigation when a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of an item. Given that XXXX has already removed this account, I believe the same standard of accuracy should apply to your records. 

If the furnisher of this information ( PNC BANK ) is unable to provide documentation verifying its accuracy and compliance with those applicable laws I stated, you must remove the account immediately. Reporting unverifiable or incomplete information violates 15 USC 1681s-2 ( b ), which prohibits furnishers from knowingly reporting inaccurate data. 

I am also concerned that continuing to report this repossession despite its removal from another bureau may lead to harm under 15 USC 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which provide for remedies in cases of willful or negligent noncompliance with the FCRA. 

Reasons for Dispute : XXXX. Failure to Provide Required Notices : I did not receive a pre-sale notice or post-sale explanation of the proceeds and deficiency balance, as required by UCC 9-611 and 9-616. Without these notices, the creditor is in violation of its legal obligations, and the reporting of the debt is invalid. 

XXXX. Incorrect Amount Reported : If the repossessed vehicle was sold, only the deficiency balance ( remaining amount after the sale proceeds were applied ) can be reported, not the full loan amount. Reporting the full balance is a clear violation of 15 USC 1681e ( b ), requiring accuracy in credit reporting. 


Requested actions : I respectfully request that you XXXX. Reinvestigate the Account : I request that you reinvestigate this account and verify its accuracy with the furnisher of the information and require the furnisher to provide COMPLETE documentation verifying its accuracy. 

XXXX. Obtain Proof of Notices and Accuracy : Require the furnisher to provide documentation of the auction results, the pre-sale and post-sale notices, and the calculation of the deficiency balance. If they can not provide this information, the account must be removed from my report. 

XXXX. Correct or Remove the Account : If the information can not be verified or is found to be incomplete or inaccurate, this account must be corrected or removed from my credit file as required under 15 USC 1681i. 

XXXX. Provide me with a written response within XXXX  days, as required by the FCRA, detailing the results of your investigation and any actions taken. 


Please note that I am prepared to escalate this dispute to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), or other appropriate authorities if necessary.

I am writing to address the inaccurate late payment listings on my consumer report, specifically concerning the accounts associated with KIKOFF, KIKOFF and XXXX, XXXX, with the reported late payment dated on my credit report. This is my third attempt to resolve this matter amicably.

I still noticed discrepancies in the information being furnished on my credit report. It is imperative to acknowledge that various federal laws are in place to safeguard consumer rights and ensure fair business practices. I would like to draw your attention to 15 USC 1666 ( B ) and 15 USC 1637 a ( a ), which explicitly prohibits reporting or treating a payment on an open-ended credit plan as late for any reason.

Furthermore, 15 USC 16819 ( B ) stipulates that as a consumer, I must grant permission for the furnishing of information on my behalf. To date, I have not provided such authorization to [ Name of Company Reporting Late Payment ]. Thus, the reporting of late payments without my consent is a violation of consumer protection laws.

Additionally, the billing errors identified under 15 U.S. Code 1666 ( b ) and 15 USC 1637 a ( a ), including the creditor 's failure to reflect payments properly on a statement and computation errors, further highlight the inaccuracies in the reported information. As per the Fair Credit Billing Act, the creditor is obligated to notify me at least 21 days before the due date if there are any discrepancies in the statement. Failure to do so renders any late payment designation as a billing error. The following items must be promptly updated to reflect "" paid as agreed '' on my consumer report : KIKOFF - XXXX, KIKOFF - XXXX I demand conclusive evidence from the creditor 's records demonstrating that the reported late payments were indeed justified and not the result of billing errors. Your persistent failure to rectify these inaccuracies not only tarnishes my consumer report but also undermines my financial standing.

I hereby request that the late payment listings associated with the aforementioned accounts be promptly updated to reflect accurate information or removed entirely. Failure to comply will result in legal action seeking monetary compensation for violations of my rights under 15 USC 1681n civil liability.",,Kikoff Inc.,FL,330XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11067774

However, among the reimbursed transactions, there was one from XX/XX/XXXX, while the non-reimbursed transactions include charges from as recent as XX/XX/XXXX. Most of these transactions were made with the same merchants. Those merchants billed different amounts each mouth during XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX on my debit card. Citi banks reason of timeframe was not acceptable. During the investigation, I had multiple phone conversations with the bank. The customer service representatives were often impatient, transferred my calls, or even hung up on me. Eventually, the bank requested that I submit a written report, which I believe was an attempt to make things difficult for me.

XXXX companies like Chime Financial, which provide services such as online banking, debit card processing, and mobile money transfers, are required to adhere to the following regulations, Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq. ) Protects consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers by establishing rights, responsibilities, and remedies. 
Regulation E ( 12 CFR Part 1005 ) Outlines specific protections, including error resolution procedures, investigation timelines, and requirements for addressing unauthorized transactions.

Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) Section 1036 ( 12 U.S.C. 5536 ) Prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices ( UDAAPs ) in connection with the offering of consumer financial products or services.

Chime Financial response, denying its responsibility under Regulation E, is concerning. Specifically due to Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation.
