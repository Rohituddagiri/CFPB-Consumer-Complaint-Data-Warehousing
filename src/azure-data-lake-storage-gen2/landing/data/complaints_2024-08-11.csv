The agency is called I C System INC. Ive explained to them multiple times I never had a XXXX XXXX. Ive contacted XXXX several times to dispute this issue off my credit report and I tried disputing this issue on the XXXX website as well. However, nothing has changed but constant calls and emails from the collection company trying to force me to pay a bill that I never put in my name. On XX/XX/XXXX, of this year, I was denied for a home that I applied for due to having a this two fraudulent bills thats in the collections. Ive explained to them as well, I never applied for a credit card in my name and even explained this issue again to XXXX. This issue is holding me back from applying and being approved for a home and damaging my credit score. This issue has gone on for too long and something has to be done. I filed a complaint on the consumer complain.gov website.

My credit report shows inaccurate dates of my vehicle reposession. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act I am wanting a removal of account due to inaccurate information. The dispute came back as "" accurate '' ( was not resolved ) and the lender has failed to remove the account even after investigation. 

In addition to the discreptencies, I contacted my XXXX ( XXXX ) and requested a receipt of refund/payout to either myself or the lender due to loss. Unfortunately XXXX XXXX has failed to provide me with the requested information and has no records. My vehicle was a loss and I never received a letter by my GAP insurance of any payment to myself or the lender? 

This unfortunate circumstance has negatively impacted my credit drastically and would appreciate some assistance with this investigation for accurate information. I am attaching a screenshot of the discreptencies from the lender. 

Thank you for your time with helping me with this complaint.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,93702,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9776801
2024-08-11,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Payday loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,,"I needed to get a quick loan to handle unexpected bills. I went to maxlendXXXXXXXX  and was approved for a loan of {$1100.00}. I was told over the phone prior to accepting the loan that I would be charged for one payment of {$600.00} and two other payments of {$680.00} to payback the loan, bringing the total payback of said loan to {$1900.00} to pay it back. Already feeling that was way to much, I still accepted. Upon receipt of loan I was given paperwork outlining the terms. Since this was all done over the phone I was of the mindset ( my failure ) that the terms on the document was simply a recap as to what was discussed over the phone. 

I kept tabs on it for the first 3 months and paid no mind to it. It was only after making a subsequent payment I realized something was amiss. I then checked the documents that were sent and the document outlined that I was being charged a finance charge of {$4900.00} along with the amount financed of {$11000.00}. I was NEVER TOLD over the phone the finance change of {$4900.00} which along side the actual loan brought the total payback to {$6000.00}. It was incredibly misleading and when I contacted maxlend.com they told me they told me over the phone that I would need to make XXXX payments versus XXXX. From which I asked the service rep "" who in the right mind would accept those terms? '' This organization needs to be flagged for the shaddy dealings and downright fraud. 

I had contacted the company maxlend.XXXX to stop payment which they stated they did but I would be contacted by a supervisor the following day and that I am still on the hook to pay the {$11000.00} which was incredibly confusing since its apparent what the service rep was looking at wasn't the same terms that were sent to me or they simply didn't care, in any event had I not seen another payment made outside of the XXXX payments told to me I would've been completely unaware of the situation. I have attached the document that was sent to me, which in itself is incredibly shady.",,"Uetsa Tsakits, Inc. d/b/a MaxLend",CA,92126,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9777998

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am filing a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX for inaccurate reporting of a charged-off debt, violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has reported a charged-off debt to Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than 180 days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX has failed to provide me with a 1099-C form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ). 

Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX without my permission. 

Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

15 U.S.C 1681 section 602 A. States I have the right to privacy.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I write to you with deep concern and dissatisfaction regarding the unauthorized inclusion of information in my consumer report, a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681b. This letter serves as an official dispute, urging your agency to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into this serious breach of my rights. 

Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX I am writing to dispute the accuracy of the information contained in my consumer credit report. Upon recent review, I have discovered entries that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), particularly Section 611, which mandates the maximum possible accuracy of information in a consumer 's file.

Furthermore, the entries in question were reported without my written permission, contravening the requirements outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) of the FCRA. As such, I request an immediate, comprehensive, and impartial investigation into these entries. I expect a detailed response outlining the findings of this investigation, including the original written instructions from me ( Consumer ) with my wet signature.

Moreover, I am not aware of any legitimate purpose for reporting these late payments, and I affirm that I did not authorize the reporting of such information to your agency. Therefore, in accordance with Section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the FCRA, I demand a thorough investigation into these disputed late payments, along with written confirmation of the investigation 's completion and details of any actions taken to rectify this matter.

Additionally, I request documentation, including the periodic statement and tracking number, to prove that each periodic statement was delivered to me at least 21 days before the payment due date, as mandated by 15 U.S. Code 1666b.

I request that you provide me with the name and address of the person ( s ) that you contacted to allegedly verify the information that I have rightfully disputed.

Failure to comply with the legal requirements outlined in this letter will necessitate pursuing all available legal remedies to address this violation of my rights under the FCRA. I trust that your agency will approach this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves.

FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : You are continuing to report fraudulent accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me, which is a clear infringement upon my privacy rights. As I mentioned before, I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. I insist that my hard inquiries and account information not be shared on my credit report. 

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : The information you continue to report falsely suggests that I applied for multiple inquiries and accounts, when in reality, these were the result of a scammer\ 's actions. This misleading and unverified reporting is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and its fairness requirements.

FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Despite my previous dispute, you have failed to verify the accuracy of the credit information you have accepted, thereby demonstrating willful noncompliance. This non-compliance is subject to civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation.

FCRA Section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information : You have yet to fulfill your obligation to disclose my right to opt out of sharing my personal information. This omission is deceptive and a direct violation of my consumer rights.

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Furnishing Deceptive Forms : Despite my previous dispute, you persist in furnishing inaccurate inquiries and accounts without proper validation, which potentially violates Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Reporting such deceptive information is unacceptable In addition to the aforementioned violations, I remind you of the previous violations outlined in my initial dispute letter, including the violation of Debt Collection Practices Act, Identity Theft Laws, Acquiring Location Information Regulations, Timely Payments Regulations, Finance Charge Determination, and Credit Report Permissible Purposes. These violations require your immediate attention and resolution.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Re : Inaccurate Reporting and Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act & XXXX XXXX To whom it may concern at XXXX XXXX TRANSUNION XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX : I just checked my credit and found some inaccuracies. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 611 of FCRA you have a responsibility of promptly deleting any information which is inaccurate or incomplete so it doesn't get reported in my report! This is my understanding as well. It's important to note that under the FCRA, even if an account has only been speculated upon or never confirmed in any waythe burden falls on you ( the credit bureau ) to provide evidence of its veracity before it can be placed on my credit report. According to the FCRA Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( l ) and the accepted STANDARD of XXXX XXXX data field reporting, I have the right to dispute any information on my credit report that I believe is not correct. When it comes to my credit report, I reserve the right to dispute any information that I deem to be inaccurate. I won't stand for any misinformation being associated with my name and financial history. If there's something on my credit report that doesn't seem right, you can bet that I'll be taking action to get it removed.I can not recognize or accept the allegation of delinquency without factual proof. There must be some sort of evidence to back up the claim. 
Otherwise, I can not and will not recognize or accept the allegation. According to federal and state law, you must report any allegations with the greatest compliance and accuracy possible.You should not report any claims that you know or should know are not in compliance with regulations and the law. If you do report such claims, you could be subject to fines or other penalties. Furthermore, reporting claims that you know are not in compliance could damage the reputation of your company.I am writing to inform you that you need to make sure all your claims are factual and certified before reporting them. This is required by the XXXX XXXX reporting standard. I request that you provide evidence to support the existence of the account and evidence that the account was used for a permissible purpose. Please provide any documents or records you may have that can help corroborate the account and its permissible purpose.I am giving you 30 days to investigate the matter and determine whether it is still being reported accurately and in compliance with regulations. If it is not, I want it removed from the report.I hereby authorize you to take whatever steps are necessary to correct my credit. Please send me physical proof of any actions taken on my behalf. I appreciate your help in making sure my credit is in good standing.Further investigation is required to verify the following claims. These claims remain unverified until further inquiry can confirm them. More research is needed to support these unsubstantiated assertions. Please report any verified claims immediately. Please certify that all claims that have been verified as accurate, complete, and timely reported have been reported in compliance with regulations or remove & reverse late payments immediately. 
Below is a summary of the data in which I am challenging : Summary of Accounts being challenged in list form XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) - ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Year Payment History XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account # : XXXX XXXX Account Description : Individual Account Status : XXXX Open Account Type : XXXX Installment Balance Owed : XXXX {$XXXX} Credit Limit : XXXX {$XXXX} Creditor Remarks : XXXX - Creditor Type : XXXX XXXX Loan Date Opened : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Date Reported : - XX/XX/XXXX Date of Last Activity : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX High Balance : XXXX {$XXXX} Last Payment : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Past Due Amount : XXXX {$XXXX} Payment Amount : XXXX {$XXXX} Payment Status : XXXX Current Term Length : XXXX XXXX The information you provided is not accurate and does not meet the minimum standards for accuracy.

Also, see the image above for XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) XXXX ( XXXX ). Ive highlighted and circled additional areas of concern. 
Lets examine Term Length ( XXXX ) showing XXXX I bet you can't wait until I'm done with this account! The compliance standards are really important, and your reporting ability is clearly lacking. As we know from the news lately -- inaccurate credit records lead to higher interest rates on loans or even worse... Prove that all information for this particular account has been verified. 
When I scrutinized XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) presenting {$XXXX}. The information reported doesn't seem to meet the standards set by XXXX XXXX guidelines. You must make sure all fields are filled out correctly and in 100 % compliances prior adding anything onto my credit profile! Please remove this inaccurate record from my report or provide proof of your compliance with applicable standards. 
When I scrutinized XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) presenting {$XXXX}. Compliance with regulatory requirements is essential for accurate credit reporting! Prove to me that your information for this account has been fully vetted and meets all the standards of federal law, including but not limited XXXX XXXX standards. I need you show proof or explain how this account is compliant Lets take a look at Creditor Remarks ( XXXX ) reporting -. There may be a problem with the data reported because it doesn't meet the required standards. The data may not be accurate because it deviates from what is required. As you know You must report all Data fields in compliance with the XXXX XXXX standards. There can be no deviation from these requirements. 
I was looking at Date Reported ( - ) expressing XX/XX/XXXX. This is a formal complaint about the content of my report. It has come to my attention that you failed in following standard procedures for accuracy, and as such I question its validity if not fixed immediately.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Experian, and XXXX are in violation of The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. FERPA, also known as the Buckley Amendment, is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Key points of the law include : Ownership of Records : Students own their education records and have the right to inspect and review them.

Consent for Disclosure : Schools generally can not disclose personally identifiable information ( PII ) from student records without written consent. it prohibits educational institutions from disclosing personally identifiable information in education records without the written consent of the student, or, if the student is a minor, the student 's parents. ( 20 U.S.C.S. 1232g ( b ) ) .Schools may disclose, without consent, "" directory '' information such as a student 's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. Transaction history is prohibited under this law, which covers the amount of the educational loan and payment methods or deferment. Their actions constitute unauthorized and illegal reporting of my educational records, specifically the transaction history, to consumer reporting agencies. This action by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX clear violation of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) of 1974. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) safeguards educational records, encompassing a wide array of information, including but not limited to grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, and personally identifiable information ( PII ) directly linked to a student. Transaction history pertinent to educational loans or financial matters, although not explicitly outlined in FERPA, falls squarely within the realm of protected information due to its direct association with the educational journey and financial status of the student. As custodians of these records, XXXX XXXX XXXX is bound by FERPA regulations. However, they have egregiously disregarded these regulations by reporting transaction histories to consumer reporting agencies without obtaining my explicit consent, thereby breaching the privacy rights guaranteed under FERPA. Moreover, the Privacy Act of 1974 supplements FERPA by regulating the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by federal agencies. This act establishes stringent measures to ensure confidentiality, accuracy, relevance, and proper use of personal information. XXXX XXXX XXXX disclosure of my transaction history to consumer reporting agencies without my explicit consent constitutes a blatant violation not only of FERPA but also of the broader principles established under the Privacy Act of 1974. These actions compromise the confidentiality and privacy protections afforded to my educational records and personal information, resulting in tangible financial damages and emotional distress. Despite my attempts to rectify this matter directly with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX their failure to acknowledge or resolve the issue necessitates the intervention of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX 

XXXX XXXX XXXX actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the transaction history of my educational affairs, DEPT OF XXXX is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ). 

Furthermore XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies.

15 U.S.C 1681 section XXXX A. States I have the right to privacy.

15 U.S.C 1681 Section XXXX A Section XXXX : It also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish a account without my written instructions 15 U.S.C 1681c.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX are in violation of The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. FERPA, also known as the Buckley Amendment, is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Key points of the law include : Ownership of Records : Students own their education records and have the right to inspect and review them. 
Consent for Disclosure : Schools generally can not disclose personally identifiable information ( PII ) from student records without written consent. it prohibits educational institutions from disclosing personally identifiable information in education records without the written consent of the student, or, if the student is a minor, the student 's parents. ( 20 U.S.C.S. 1232g ( b ) ) .Schools may disclose, without consent, "" directory '' information such as a student 's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. Transaction history is prohibited under this law, which covers the amount of the educational loan and payment methods or deferment. Their actions constitute unauthorized and illegal reporting of my educational records, specifically the transaction history, to consumer reporting agencies. This action by XXXX XXXX XXXX is a clear violation of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) of 1974. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) safeguards educational records, encompassing a wide array of information, including but not limited to grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, and personally identifiable information ( PII ) directly linked to a student. Transaction history pertinent to educational loans or financial matters, although not explicitly outlined in FERPA, falls squarely within the realm of protected information due to its direct association with the educational journey and financial status of the student. As custodians of these records, XXXX XXXX XXXX is bound by FERPA regulations. However, they have egregiously disregarded these regulations by reporting transaction histories to consumer reporting agencies without obtaining my explicit consent, thereby breaching the privacy rights guaranteed under FERPA. Moreover, the Privacy Act of 1974 supplements FERPA by regulating the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by federal agencies. This act establishes stringent measures to ensure confidentiality, accuracy, relevance, and proper use of personal information. XXXX XXXX XXXX disclosure of my transaction history to consumer reporting agencies without my explicit consent constitutes a blatant violation not only of FERPA but also of the broader principles established under the Privacy Act of 1974. These actions compromise the confidentiality and privacy protections afforded to my educational records and personal information, resulting in tangible financial damages and emotional distress. Despite my attempts to rectify this matter directly with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX their failure to acknowledge or resolve the issue necessitates the intervention of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXctions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the transaction history of my educational affairs, DEPT OF XXXX is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ). 

Furthermore XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. XXXX OF XXXX improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX without my permission. 

Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has reported a charged-off debt to XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than 180 days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX has failed to provide me with a 1099-C form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ). 

Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax without my permission. 

Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

Furthermore, the account was reported as "" Seriously past due '' without sufficient evidence or verification of the debt. 

Potential Consumer Rights Violation : Reporting this account as derogatory without a valid contract and sufficient evidence XXXX constitute a violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA.

Please notify me of the outcome of your investigation within the XXXX period as required by the FCRA. If the investigation reveals that the information is inaccurate, I request that the account be removed from my credit report and that I be provided with an updated copy of my report.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Report Information Credit Report Account Number : XXXX Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear CFPB I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate information on my credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), which gives me the right to dispute information I believe to be inaccurate or incomplete. 

The account in question is from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a collections company, with which I have no contractual relationship. Specifically, the details are as follows : Account Number : XXXX Balance : {$2400.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/year> Payment Status : Seriously past due/ Assigned to attorney, collection agency, or credit grantor 's internal collection department Last Reported : XX/XX/year> Dispute Basis : No Contractual Relationship : Under 15 U.S. Code 1692e of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), debt collectors are required to report accurate information and must not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representations. I do not have any contractual agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which invalidates the reporting of this debt on my credit report. 

Inaccurate Reporting of Debt : The FCRA mandates that all information on a consumer 's credit report must be accurate and verifiable. Since there is no contract or agreement between myself and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the accuracy of this reported debt is in question. Additionally, the absence of payment history and the derogatory information reported without adequate evidence further violates the FCRA. 

Potential Violation of Consumer Rights : The continued reporting of this account as derogatory, without proper verification and in the absence of a valid contract, may constitute a violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA. Additionally, the failure to provide complete information about the payment history and the terms of the alleged debt raises concerns about the legality of this reporting.

Request for Resolution : I request that [ Credit Bureau Name ] conduct a thorough investigation into this matter. If you are unable to verify the accuracy and legality of this information, I demand that this collections account be removed from my credit report immediately. 

Please notify me of the outcome of your investigation within the 30-day period as required by the FCRA. If the investigation reveals that the information is inaccurate, I request that the account be removed from my credit report and that I be provided with an updated copy of my report. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If further information or documentation is required, please do not hesitate to contact me.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I write to you with deep concern and dissatisfaction regarding the unauthorized inclusion of information in my consumer report, a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681b. This letter serves as an official dispute, urging your agency to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into this serious breach of my rights. 

XXXX XXXX I am writing to dispute the accuracy of information contained in my consumer credit report. Upon recent review, I have discovered entries that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), particularly Section 611, which mandates the maximum possible accuracy of information in a consumer 's file. 

Furthermore, the entries in question were reported without my written permission, contravening the requirements outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) of the FCRA. As such, I request an immediate, comprehensive, and impartial investigation into these entries. I expect a detailed response outlining the findings of this investigation, including the original written instructions from me ( Consumer ) with my wet signature. 

Moreover, I am not aware of any legitimate purpose for reporting these late payments, and I affirm that I did not authorize the reporting of such information to your agency. Therefore, in accordance with Section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the FCRA, I demand a thorough investigation into these disputed late payments, along with written confirmation of the investigation 's completion and details of any actions taken to rectify this matter. 

Additionally, I request documentation, including the periodic statement and tracking number, to prove that each periodic statement was delivered to me at least 21 days before the payment due date, as mandated by 15 U.S. Code 1666b.

I request that you provide me with the name and address of the person ( s ) that you contacted to allegedly verify the information that I have rightfully disputed. 

Failure to comply with the legal requirements outlined in this letter will necessitate pursuing all available legal remedies to address this violation of my rights under the FCRA. I trust that your agency will approach this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. 

FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : You are continuing to report fraudulent accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me, which is a clear infringement upon my privacy rights. As I mentioned before, I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. I insist that my hard inquiries and account information not be shared on my credit report. 

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : The information you continue to report falsely suggests that I applied for multiple inquiries and accounts, when in reality, these were the result of a scammer\ 's actions. This misleading and unverified reporting is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and its fairness requirements. 

FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Despite my previous dispute, you have failed to verify the accuracy of the credit information you have accepted, thereby demonstrating willful noncompliance. This noncompliance is subject to civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation. 

FCRA Section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information : You have yet to fulfill your obligation to disclose my right to opt out of sharing my personal information. This omission is deceptive and a direct violation of my consumer rights. 

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Furnishing Deceptive Forms : Despite my previous dispute, you persist in furnishing inaccurate inquiries and accounts without proper validation, which potentially violates Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Reporting such deceptive information is unacceptable In addition to the aforementioned violations, I remind you of the previous violations outlined in my initial dispute letter, including the violation of Debt Collection Practices Act, Identity Theft Laws, Acquiring Location Information Regulations, Timely Payments Regulations, Finance Charge Determination, and Credit Report Permissible Purposes. These violations require your immediate attention and resolution.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am filing a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX, Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX for inaccurate reporting of a charged-off debt, violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). 

XXXX XXXX XXXX has reported a charged-off debt to Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than 180 days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to provide me with a 1099-C form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, XXXX XXXX XXXX is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ). 

Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. XXXX XXXX XXXX improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX without my permission. 

Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am filing a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax for inaccurate reporting of a charged-off debt, violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). 


XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX has reported a charged-off debt to XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than 180 days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX has failed to provide me with a XXXX form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( XXXX ). 

Furthermore, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to XXXX of XXXX statutory exceptions. XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax without my permission. 

Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

You { XXXX, XXXX, XXXX } reported an alleged transaction as Late. 
15 U.S. Code 1666b - Timing of payments ( a ) TIME TO MAKE PAYMENTS Acreditormay not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless thecreditorhas adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required bysection 1637 ( b ) of this titleis mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 
15 USC 1681e ( b ) ( b ) ACCURACY OF REPORT Whenever aconsumer reporting agencyprepares aconsumer reportit shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 

I requested the information that you must have or possess by law in order for you to report a payment as late.

This is being request pursuant rule 1002.

In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the co
nditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met.

You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late and the evidence that must be sent to you to prove that this transaction was late.
It has been over 30 days and you have not properly verify the information.

Id. at 1303 ; see also XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. 2019 ) ( defining verify as [ t ] o prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate ).

15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) REINVESTIGATIONS OF DISPUTED
INFORMATION ( 1 ) REINVESTIGATION REQUIRED ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in aconsumersfileat aconsumer reporting agencyis disputed by theconsumerand theconsumernotifies the agency directly, or indirectly through areseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate andrecordthe current status of the disputed information, or del
ete the item from thefilein accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from theconsumerorreseller. 

Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified.

Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1304. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account.

I am requesting pursuant 15 USC 1681i ( 6 ) NOTICE OF RESULTS OF REINVESTIGATION ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by theconsumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to theconsumerby the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher.

when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information.
In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ).

Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information. That provision thus contemplates that when information can no longer be verified, the proper response is to delet [ e ] it. See Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1304 Delete the information you are Reporting as Late from account.

This process began in XXXX of 2023, yes a full year and they have not resolved it, where I disputed with the court ( attached ). The court states that it doe snot supply information to the Bureaus. I submitted Disputed to XXXX, Experian, and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, to no avail.

I submitted another Dispute to the bureaus in XXXX with the letters sent by XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX said it was verified, which is impossible. XXXX and Experian did not even respond ( illegals ) Here is a summary of the egregious missteps by the credit bureaus : Failure to Correct Errors : Despite providing all necessary evidence, each bureau has inexplicably failed to correct the inaccuracy. Their responses have been dismissive and inadequate, lacking any substantive action to rectify the mistake. 

Negligent Handling of Disputes : The process followed by the credit bureaus in handling my dispute has been grossly inefficient and unprofessional. Their failure to resolve the dispute in a timely manner reflects a troubling disregard for consumer rights. 

Impact on Creditworthiness : The erroneous bankruptcy record is significantly damaging my creditworthiness and, consequently, my financial stability. This ongoing issue has led to undue stress and has negatively impacted my ability to secure credit.

I demand immediate action to rectify this situation. Specifically, I require : Prompt Removal : Immediate removal of the inaccurate bankruptcy entry from all three credit reports. 

Written Confirmation : Written confirmation from each credit bureau acknowledging the removal and detailing the corrective actions taken. 

Investigation and Accountability : A thorough investigation into the handling of my dispute, including a detailed explanation of why my evidence was ignored and what measures will be implemented to prevent such issues in the future. 

If these demands are not met within 15 days from the date of this letter, I will be compelled to escalate this matter further, including but not limited to seeking legal redress and filing formal complaints with additional regulatory bodies.

3. Potential Financial Compensation for Violations Under the FCRA, if the credit reporting agencies fail to correct these errors or continue to report inaccurate information, I may be entitled to monetary compensation. Specifically : Actual Damages : I may recover actual damages incurred as a result of the errors, such as increased interest rates, denied credit, or other financial losses.

I requested the information that you must have or possess by law in order for you to report a payment as late.

This is being request pursuant rule 1002.

In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the conditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met.

You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late and the evidence that must be sent to you to prove that this transaction was late.

15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) REINVESTIGATIONS OF DISPUTED INFORMATION ( 1 ) REINVESTIGATION REQUIRED ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in aconsumersfileat aconsumer reporting agencyis disputed by theconsumerand theconsumernotifies the agency directly, or indirectly through areseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate andrecordthe current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from thefilein accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from theconsumerorreseller.

Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified.

Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1304. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account.

I am requesting pursuant 15 USC 1681i ( 6 ) NOTICE OF RESULTS OF REINVESTIGATION ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by theconsumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to theconsumerby the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher.

when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information.

In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ).

Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information. That provision thus contemplates that when information can no longer be verified, the proper response is to delet [ XXXX ] it.

You { XXXX, XXXX, XXXX } reported an alleged transaction as Late. 15 U.S. Code 1666b - Timing of payments ( a ) TIME TO MAKE PAYMENTS A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 15 USC 1681e ( b ) ( b ) ACCURACY OF REPORT Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. I requested the information that you must have or possess by law in order for you to report a payment as late. This is being request pursuant rule 1002. In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the conditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met. You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late and the evidence that must be sent to you to prove that this transaction was late. It has been over 30 days and you have not properly verify the information. Id. at XXXX ; see also Blacks Law Dictionary ( 11th ed. 2019 ) ( defining verify as [ t ] o prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate ). 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) REINVESTIGATIONS OF DISPUTED INFORMATION ( XXXX ) REINVESTIGATION REQUIRED ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( XXXX ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified. Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1304. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account. I am requesting pursuant 15 USC 1681i ( 6 ) NOTICE OF RESULTS OF REINVESTIGATION ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by the consumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to the consumer by the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher. when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information. In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information. That provision thus contemplates that when information can no longer be verified, the proper response is to delet [ e ] it.

Account Information : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Account Number : XXXX Amount : {$480.00} I previously submitted a dispute to Equifax regarding the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account. Despite providing evidence supporting the inaccuracies and requesting its removal from my credit report, Equifax failed to conduct a thorough investigation and the disputed account remains on my credit report. 

As a consumer protected under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to request the removal of inaccurate or outdated information from my credit report. Equifax failure to comply with this law is a violation of my consumer rights and has caused me financial harm and distress. 

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Equifax for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate removal of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Equifax upholds its obligations under the law. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution and your assistance in rectifying this issue.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TX,76018,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9817980

The account in question is from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a collections company, with which I have no contractual relationship. Specifically, the details are as follows : Account Number : XXXX Balance : {$2400.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/year> Payment Status : Seriously past due/ Assigned to attorney, collection agency, or credit grantor 's internal collection department Last Reported : XX/XX/year> Dispute Basis : No Contractual Relationship : Under 15 U.S. Code 1692e of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), debt collectors are required to report accurate information and must not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representations. I do not have any contractual agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which invalidates the reporting of this debt on my credit report. 

Inaccurate Reporting of Debt : The FCRA mandates that all information on a consumer 's credit report must be accurate and verifiable. Since there is no contract or agreement between myself and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the accuracy of this reported debt is in question. Additionally, the absence of payment history and the derogatory information reported without adequate evidence further violates the FCRA. 

Potential Violation of Consumer Rights : The continued reporting of this account as derogatory, without proper verification and in the absence of a valid contract, may constitute a violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA. Additionally, the failure to provide complete information about the payment history and the terms of the alleged debt raises concerns about the legality of this reporting.

Request for Resolution : I request that [ Credit Bureau Name ] conduct a thorough investigation into this matter. If you are unable to verify the accuracy and legality of this information, I demand that this collections account be removed from my credit report immediately.

Please notify me of the outcome of your investigation within the 30-day period as required by the FCRA. If the investigation reveals that the information is inaccurate, I request that the account be removed from my credit report and that I be provided with an updated copy of my report.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If further information or documentation is required, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I requested the information that you must have or possess by law in order for you to report a payment as late. This is being request pursuant rule 1002. In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the conditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met. You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late and the evidence that must be sent to you to prove that this transaction was late. It has been over 30 days and you have not properly verify the information. Id. at 1303 ; see also Blacks Law Dictionary ( 11th ed. 2019 ) ( defining verify as [ t ] o prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate ). 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) REINVESTIGATIONS OF DISPUTED INFORMATION ( 1 ) REINVESTIGATION REQUIRED ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified. Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1304. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account. I am requesting pursuant 15 USC 1681i ( 6 ) NOTICE OF RESULTS OF REINVESTIGATION ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by the consumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to the consumer by the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher. when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information. In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information. That provision thus contemplates that when information can no longer be verified, the proper response is to delet [ e ] it. See Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1304 Delete the information you are Reporting as Late from account.

The account in question is listed under XXXX and has been marked which I believe may be inaccurately reported. XXXX and Citibank didnot provide the method of the reinvestigation. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I am entitled to an accurate and complete credit report. The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the information in credit reports is both fair and accurate. Inaccurate or incomplete information must be corrected or removed. 
Moreover, the FCRA requires that any reported late payments must be accurate and substantiated. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c, late payments must reflect the true nature of the account status. If a late payment entry is incorrect or outdated, it should be promptly rectified.

Failure to comply with these requirements can be considered willful non-compliance under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, which addresses the responsibilities of credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate records and the legal repercussions for failing to do so. 

In light of these legal obligations, I request the following information regarding the reinvestigation process : The specific procedures XXXX will follow to verify the accuracy of the reported charge-off and any related late payments. 
Details on how communication with Citibank will be managed to obtain updated or corrected information.

In response, Equifax requested that I submit proper identification to proceed with the investigation, which I promptly provided. Despite this, on XX/XX/year>, I received a letter from Equifax claiming that the inquiry was valid because my information was allegedly used to obtain a mortgage. 

Let me be clear : I am not disputing the validity of the inquiry. I am disputing that this inquiry was fraudulent and unauthorized. I never granted permission or authorized anyone to make an inquiry regarding a mortgage on my behalf. To substantiate my claim, I subsequently provided Equifax with an FTC affidavit of fraud confirming that this inquiry was unauthorized. 

Equifax has blatantly violated my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and CFPB guidelines by failing to provide proofsuch as my signature or any documentationauthorizing this inquiry. They are now legally obligated to remove this unauthorized inquiry from my credit report immediately. 

This is a formal demand for the immediate removal of the fraudulent inquiry.

Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified.

when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information.

In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ).

Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information. That provision thus contemplates that when information can no longer be verified, the proper response is to delet [ e ] it.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I filed a complaint on XX/XX/year>, XXXX. and I am writing to formally dispute the account associated with the credit card account ending in XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$12000.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account number XXXX in the amount of {$11000.00} and XXXX  account number XXXX in the amount of {$920.00} which is fraudulently reporting on my credit report. I have repeatedly notified your company that this account does not belong to me and that it was opened without my knowledge or consent. Despite my numerous attempts to resolve this issue, the fraudulent account continues to appear on my credit report with late payments and as a charge-off, severely damaging my credit score. Violations of My Rights : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violations : Under the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I have the right to dispute inaccurate information in my credit report. Your continued reporting of this fraudulent account, despite my numerous disputes, violates my right to have inaccurate or unverifiable information corrected or removed. The FCRA mandates that once a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any item of information, the furnisher ( in this case, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) must conduct a reasonable investigation. Failure to do so or continuing to report inaccurate information constitutes a direct violation of this federal law. 2. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) Violations : According to the GLBA, particularly 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to protect the privacy of nonpublic personal information and to provide notice before disclosing such information to nonaffiliated third parties. The fact that this account was fraudulently opened under my name suggests a breach of your duty to safeguard my personal information. This failure has resulted in unauthorized access to my sensitive data, further compounding the violation of my rights under the GLBA. 3. Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) Violations : The ECOA, under 15 U.S.C. 1691, explicitly prohibits creditors from discriminating against any applicant who exercises their rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. By refusing to remove this fraudulent account and continuing to report it negatively on my credit, despite my rightful disputes, you are effectively discriminating against me for exercising my rights under federal law. This discrimination, in turn, subjects you to penalties and legal consequences under the ECOA. Actions Requested : Given the clear violations of my rights under these federal statutes, I am formally requesting the following actions : 1. Immediate Removal of the Fraudulent Account : I demand that the fraudulent car loan account be removed from my credit report immediately. This includes removing all associated negative marks, such as late payments and the charge-off status. 2. Cease All Collection Activities : I request that you cease any collection activities related to this fraudulent account, as I did not authorize this loan or any related transactions. 3. Investigation and Response : I request a thorough investigation into this matter, including how my personal information was compromised and how this fraudulent account was opened. Please provide a detailed response outlining the steps taken during the investigation and the results. 4. Confirmation of Action Taken : Once the fraudulent account is removed from my credit report, I request that you provide written confirmation of the removal and any other corrective actions taken. Failure to Honor Request and Discrimination : If you fail to honor my request for the removal of this fraudulent account and continue to report inaccurate information on my credit report, it will be a violation of my rights under the FCRA. Additionally, if you discriminate against me in any way for exercising my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1691 ), I will pursue all available legal remedies. According to the ECOA : It shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transactionbecause the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. Discrimination for exercising my rights is strictly prohibited under federal law and may result in further legal action. Please consider this letter as my formal notice and request for immediate action under the relevant provisions of the FCRA, GLBA, and ECOA. If this issue is not resolved within 30 days, I will be forced to escalate this matter by filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and possibly pursuing legal action.

In response, Equifax requested that I submit proper identification to proceed with the investigation, which I promptly provided. Despite this, on XX/XX/year>, I received a letter from Equifax claiming that the inquiry was valid because my information was allegedly used to obtain a mortgage. 

Let me be clear : I am not disputing the validity of the inquiry. I am disputing that this inquiry was fraudulent and unauthorized. I never granted permission or authorized anyone to make an inquiry regarding a mortgage on my behalf. To substantiate my claim, I subsequently provided Equifax with an FTC affidavit of fraud confirming that this inquiry was unauthorized. 

Equifax has blatantly violated my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and CFPB guidelines by failing to provide proofsuch as my signature or any documentationauthorizing this inquiry. They are now legally obligated to remove this unauthorized inquiry from my credit report immediately. 

This is a formal demand for the immediate removal of the fraudulent inquiry. Failure to comply will leave me with no option but to escalate this matter further, including pursuing legal action to enforce my rights under the law.

XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX has reported a charged-off debt to Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than 180 days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX has failed to provide me with a 1099-C form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX Na is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ). 

Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. Capital One Bank USA Na improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX without my permission. 

Additionally, Capital One Bank USA Na has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 611 of FCRA you have a responsibility of promptly deleting any information which is inaccurate or incomplete so it doesn't get reported in my report! This is my understanding as well. It's important to note that under the FCRA, even if an account has only been speculated upon or never confirmed in any waythe burden falls on you ( the credit bureau ) to provide evidence of its veracity before it can be placed on my credit report. According to the FCRA Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( l ) and the accepted STANDARD of metro 2 data field reporting, I have the right to dispute any information on my credit report that I believe is not correct. When it comes to my credit report, I reserve the right to dispute any information that I deem to be inaccurate. I won't stand for any misinformation being associated with my name and financial history. If there's something on my credit report that doesn't seem right, you can bet that I'll be taking action to get it removed.I can not recognize or accept the allegation of delinquency without factual proof. There must be some sort of evidence to back up the claim.

Otherwise, I can not and will not recognize or accept the allegation. According to federal and state law, you must report any allegations with the greatest compliance and accuracy possible.You should not report any claims that you know or should know are not in compliance with regulations and the law. If you do report such claims, you could be subject to fines or other penalties. Furthermore, reporting claims that you know are not in compliance could damage the reputation of your company.I am writing to inform you that you need to make sure all your claims are factual and certified before reporting them. This is required by the Metro 2 reporting standard. I request that you provide evidence to support the existence of the account and evidence that the account was used for a permissible purpose. Please provide any documents or records you may have that can help corroborate the account and its permissible purpose.I am giving you 30 days to investigate the matter and determine whether it is still being reported accurately and in compliance with regulations. If it is not, I want it removed from the report.I hereby authorize you to take whatever steps are necessary to correct my credit. Please send me physical proof of any actions taken on my behalf. I appreciate your help in making sure my credit is in good standing.Further investigation is required to verify the following claims. These claims remain unverified until further inquiry can confirm them. More research is needed to support these unsubstantiated assertions. Please report any verified claims immediately. Please certify that all claims that have been verified as accurate, complete, and timely reported have been reported in compliance with regulations or remove & reverse late payments immediately.

Lets examine Term Length ( XXXX ) showing XXXX I bet you can't wait until I'm done with this account! The compliance standards are really important, and your reporting ability is clearly lacking. As we know from the news lately -- inaccurate credit records lead to higher interest rates on loans or even worse... Prove that all information for this particular account has been verified.

When I scrutinized Balance Owed ( XXXX ) presenting {$31000.00}. The information reported doesn't seem to meet the standards set by Metro 2 guidelines.

There may be a problem with the data reported because it doesn't meet the required standards. The data may not be accurate because it deviates from what is required. As you know You must report all Data fields in compliance with the Metro 2 standards. There can be no deviation from these requirements.

You must finish your information verification within a reasonable time frame and be able to evaluate and confirm all of the information in my credit report. My credit history, as well as the following information, have never been validated or correctly reported. 
I will exercise my consumer rights by requesting that factually truthful, verifiable, and compliant data be obtained and placed on my credit report. I also require that any mistakes be fixed permanently. 
Below is a summary of the data in which I am challenging : Summary of Inquiries being challenged in list form XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX ) - ( XXXX ) XX/XX/year> Inquiries XXXX  XXXX  XX/XX/year> Experian. I received a credit report from you that showed a few unfamiliar companies. 
It looks like they put an inquiry on my file without my knowledge, but this shouldn't be possible unless it was something approved by me first. Under U.S.

Code, 15, U.S.C 1681 es seq. Section 604, all users must have a permissible purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to obtain a consumer report. Please have this inquiry removed from my credit file or forward me documentation ( physical proof ) that you have proven permissible purpose for this inquiry. I am reporting that there are some negative items in my credit profile, and I have confirmed that they are not accurate. I dispute these claims and demand that any negative information be removed from the reports immediately. The claims that this information in my report is negative, untrue, incorrect, incomplete, untimely, and not verifiable are unsubstantiated. I have yet to be provided physical verifiable proof that the claims of negativity within my report are true. After reviewing my report, I noticed several deviations from mandatory reporting standards therefore the data in my report can not be accurate and complete! With that said, I refute your allegations and challenge you to provide proof that you have the right to report this incomplete negative information about me. Document that you have complied with the reporting requirements, and report without any deviations. If you have not complied with the requirements or there are any negative aspects below that have been challenged, you must remove them from my report. Per 15 U.S.C 1681e Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates "" Also per 12 CFR Part 1022 ( Regulation V ) requires furnishers to : XXXX  - Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity. XXXX  - Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate. XXXX - Conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes According to XXXX, in order to make a lawful report, you must follow the Metro 2 compliance standards. Also as stated in the XXXX Any Deviation From These Standards Jeopardizes the Integrity of The Data. This means that any mistakes in reporting claims can make the information less accurate. This is important to remember because it affects the accuracy of any federally regulated reports. With that said! I found some mistakes and inaccuracies in your report, and I would like to invoke my rights to dispute/challenge these inaccurate and non-compliant items. If you continue to report claims that are not perfect, it shows that you do not care about my rights as a consumer.I don't think it's fair for you to report on me in a way that isn't confirmed to be ethical and meets the standards of certified reporting.The following claims about me were not reported correctly and do not meet federal requirements. I am challenging these claims and asking for proof that the proper reporting standards were followed.

If they are found to be fraudulent, I would like them immediately deleted from my credit file. 
Appreciatively I have listed the concerns I have about your reporting in this document. It is not complete and does not meet my standards. According to the law, you and the data furnishers must certify all aspects of the required FCRA and Metro 2 compliance. This must be done in a truthful, correct, complete, and timely manner as to not violate my consumer and civil rights. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 611 of FCRA, credit bureaus have a responsibility to delete any information from credit reports which is inaccurate or incomplete. This is important to note, as even if an account has only been speculated upon or never confirmed in any way, the burden falls on the credit bureau to provide evidence of its veracity before it can be placed on a credit report. If the information in a credit report is wrong, it was never proven to be factual, and the consumer has the right to take legal action against the credit bureau.

XXXX XXXX XXXX has reported a charged-off debt to XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax on my credit report.

XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate.

15 U.S. Code 1666b - Timing of payments ( a ) TIME TO MAKE PAYMENTS Acreditormay not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless thecreditorhas adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required bysection 1637 ( b ) of this titleis mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

I requested the information that you must have or possess by law in order for you to report a payment as late.

This is being request pursuant rule 1002.

In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the conditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met.

You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late and the evidence that must be sent to you to prove that this transaction was late.

15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) REINVESTIGATIONS OF DISPUTED INFORMATION ( XXXX ) REINVESTIGATION REQUIRED ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in aconsumersfileat aconsumer reporting agencyis disputed by theconsumerand theconsumernotifies the agency directly, or indirectly through areseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate andrecordthe current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from thefilein accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from theconsumerorreseller.

Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified. 
XXXX, 827 F.3d at 1304. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account. 
I am requesting pursuant 15 USC 1681i ( 6 ) NOTICE OF RESULTS OF REINVESTIGATION ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by theconsumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to theconsumerby the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher.

when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information.

In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ).

Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information. That provision thus contemplates that when information can no longer be verified, the proper response is to delet [ XXXX ] it.

The car was not financed and returned to the company before we drove off the lot I obtained insurance in my name for my son to get the car, we decided to return the car and didnt have the car for the month of insurance I am being charged. I believe this company actually owes me money.

A trustee of a XXXX ( which XXXX holds themselves out to be ) makes all the decisions and runs the Trust on behalf of the beneficiaries like a CEO runs a business. That is a Trustees job. First, the trustees have a fiduciary duty, including the duties of care and loyalty, meaning that they act in good faith with the belief that the actions they do and approve are in the best interests of the shareholders ( beneficiaries ). 
In this case XXXX is just a false figurehead that does nothing. This is misrepresentation and it also is a scheme to defraud the public, and the judges in court with foreclosure cases to take the property away from the owners. XXXX intent is to make sure everyone thinks that they are a prestigious bank. XXXX is not a bank or a lender helping the consumer. Instead, they are a debt buyer of bad debt, not helping the consumer, from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( who does not lend to consumers but lends to mortgage companies )XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX instead of holding the mortgage company they gave the money to, liable to pay the money back, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX sell the bad debt to a debt collector who buys bad debt. XXXX buys bad debt. Exhibit XXXX XXXX is a debt collector and sells to investors who hope they collect the bad debt. They hire lawyers who are also debt collectors. They disguise themselves, so they do not have to adhere to the ridged federal Fair Debt Collection Practice Act 15US Code 1692 and in Florida the Florida Consumer Collection Practice Act, FS 559.72 Pretium had me fooled that they were a prestigious bank. But they are a sleazy debt collector, and they have violated FS 559.72 ( 9 ) Claim, attempt, or threaten to enforce a debt when such person knows that the debt is not legitimate, or assert the existence of some other legal right when such person knows that the right does not exist. 
I told the law firm XXXX that they do not have a valid XXXX on property because they do not have a valid assignment. XXXX does not have a valid assignment for many reasons but first because they can not be the assignor ( seller ) and the assignee ( buyer ) of my mortgage, which they did. Fs XXXX requires a valid assignment from the valid lender to the next valid lender. Exhibit XXXX  invalid assignment. Prior lender XXXX XXXX XXXX ( who changed their name to XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) was indicted for fraud by the Federal Trade Commission in XXXX, so XXXX  sign in their place as the assignor for them in XXXX and assigned the mortgage to themselves to XXXX in Minnesota. XXXX can not do this. The Secretary of State in Minnesota says XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX does not even exist in Minnesota as XXXX claims they do. Exhibit XXXX  The lender before was XXXX who assigned a defective assignment in XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX then corrected the assignment to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX and filed an amended assignment in XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who changed their name to XXXX XXXX XXXX need to file a corrected assignment to XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, which they have not done, and they need to have XXXX sign it and only XXXX XXXX, XXXX to be valid. 
I advised the law firm partner XXXX XXXX who is in charge of compliance, and she ignored me. So did XXXX XXXX who is an associate at this law firm.

Statement payment due amount has never aligned with website account detail or payment demands from the lender. It has always been unclear what obligation is. 

Communication ( statements ) are misleading and at times inaccurate. The business tactics can be abusive. For example, the lender sent someone to the borrower 's home XX/XX/XXXX, the reason for the home invasion is unclear.. 

Remaining balance reported by the lender at this time is {$2500.00} lump sum amount Interest/Fees over the life of the loan 40 % ( 15 % interest disclosed at loan origination ) No explanation has been provided for the 40 % interest and fees. 
Fee amounts and allocations inconsistent over the life of the loan and feel deceptive No explanation has been provided for the lump sum amount requested on XX/XX/XXXX. I have exhausted all resources within OneMain Financial last escalation to Executive team resulted in the home invasion associated with the escalation and the lender executive team member was unresponsive to email from the borrower after the home invasion. 

Additional Background ( loan initiation ) From the beginning, the relationship got off to a bad start and before the borrower knew it they were trapped. The borrower did not receive a copy of the loan documents to review until three years after the loan origination. The borrower was dependent on the website and statements, which were different. The account details ( and payment demands ) on the website did not match the statements. The statements changed without notice and details therein were misaligned and, in some cases, inaccurate. The business tactics were forceful and deceptive for no reason ( within the first 3 months ). 

Request for information went unanswered, the borrower was directed to call a designated branch who told them to call back ( allow time for research or processing ). The emails the borrower sent to the branch went unanswered. The borrower was directed to call or received no response. Every escalation outside of the branch was rerouted back to the branch. 

The borrower would never have signed a contract for the interest coupled with the multi-tiered fee structure OneMain Financial implemented. The layered fee structure the lender implemented that was not disclosed and the reporting and allocations were unclear and inconsistent over the life of the loan. The lender represented themselves as a bank providing a typical installment loan ; however, the business model and practices have been unimaginable. For example : o The payment amount requested has been greater than what was contractually required ( based on the statement ) with no explanation. 
o The statements changed without notice. 
o The borrowers ability to understand and manage the account was blocked and changed without notice, including : 1 ) the lender would not share loan documents ; loan documents published on the website more than three years after loan origination ; 2 ) the lender would not update the payment due date, which greatly impacted the borrower ; 3 ) the lender submitted payments that were not authorized and held borrow accountable for any NSF fees ; 4 ) the lender removed borrowers ability to cancel or schedule payments without notice or any reasonable cause ; 5 ) website features for viewing account details changed without notice ; 6 ) the lender did not provide notifications or disclosures ; changes were made and communicated directly in statements on the date they were implemented. Some changes made were not disclosed at all ( the borrower must reconcile on their own changes the lender made ) ; 7 ) there were no escalation channels, as issues surfaced from unanswered questions there was no where to go. 

In the borrower 's final escalation attempt XX/XX/XXXX ( because the account was 45 days delinquent due to misinformation and lender being unresponsive ), OneMain Financial sent someone to the borrowers home shortly after that escalation to repossess collateral ( XXXX XXXX XXXX vehicle ). The borrower received a repossession notice dated for the same day as the home invasion from the individual responding to the escalation ( XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX did not respond to a follow up email from me after sending the letter or anytime thereafter. At the time of the home invasion {$44000.00} ( which includes 30 % interest and fees ) had been paid against the borrowed amount ( {$30000.00} ) and no notification of default or repossession had been made until that day associated with the escalation. OneMain Financial entered the borrowers home by opening the garage and opening the vehicle but did not take the vehicle ( there was a hook added that the borrower had to remove following these events ). The action by OneMain Financial felt like an act completed to intimidate, ultimately meant to terrorize borrower and the family at the end of life for the loan ( to cause further harm to continue pain and suffering already experienced at the hands of OneMain Financial ). There was no loan security risk or interest that would warrant that home invasion outside of a personal attack based on OneMain Financial actions XXXX. 

Since no good faith effort has worked within OneMain Financial the borrower is submitting a complaint to the CFPB for guidance on how best to handle this situation, specifically to research events XXXX and determine next steps.

As a consumer, I rely on credit reporting agencies to provide accurate and fair reporting of my credit history. However, Experian has failed to uphold this responsibility. 

Despite my repeated efforts to dispute the inaccurate information, Experian has neglected to conduct a proper investigation as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This negligence constitutes a violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681, which mandates credit reporting agencies to ensure the accuracy of the information they report and to investigate any disputes thoroughly and promptly. 

The continued presence of this inaccurate information on my credit report has caused significant harm to my financial reputation and has resulted in adverse consequences. I have provided Experian with all necessary documentation to support my dispute, yet they have failed to correct the errors within the required time frame. 

I am formally requesting that the CFPB intervene and take the necessary action to ensure that Experian fulfills their legal obligations to investigate and correct inaccurate information. Furthermore, if Experian does not rectify this situation within the next 10 business days, I will seek legal action for defamation and any other applicable claims due to their negligent reporting and failure to correct these inaccuracies. 

I trust that the CFPB will address this matter promptly to prevent further harm to my financial standing and to hold Experian accountable for their failure to comply with federal regulations.

The lawsuit will filed due to the utter lack of response from your company. When someone is the victim of identity theft, it is simply a nightmare trying to get false information removed from a credit file. I have contacted all of the false creditors listed on my credit file. I have challenged all of the false listings on my credit file. Nothing ever happens to fix the situation. Over 90 days ago I wrote each the creditors in question and demanded proof that I am their customer. I asked for proof of the alleged debt, including specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. So far none of them has been able to provide such proof to me. I have sent follow-up letters to each of them and there is still no proof. I have attempted phone contact, but I simply get transferred around and nothing ever gets accomplished. I have fully investigated my rights in this matter. Under the doctrine of estoppel by silence, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I may presume that no proof of the alleged debt, nor therefore any such debt, in fact exists. I have copies of the certified letters and dates prepared to bring to court. Also, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, these disputed items may not appear on my credit report if they can not be supported by any evidence. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if they can not verify the debt within 30 days, then it must be removed. Your letters to me claim to have "" verified '' the debt, but this is in fact not true under law. Simply contacting the alleged creditor and asking them to match up numbers in their database is no sufficient verification for identity theft. Of course the information matches up. Someone clearly used my information without my authorization. Now I am suing EXPERIAN for being such a pain in the posterior to me. I have provided more than sufficient evidence to get these false accounts removed. Feel free to reach out to address this issue before it escalates legally.. via letter at my address listed at the top of this letter. This matter can be settled simply by your agreement to remove the false information from my credit file. I require a response, on point, in writing, hand signed, and in a timely manner. If I get another pointless letter from you saying that it has already been "" verified '' then there will be no more opportunity for negotiation. This will proceed in court until I have successfully proven to a judge that this false information must be removed from my credit file. I will also be aggressively pursuing the full judgment that I can get against EXPERIAN for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Defamation.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I am entitled to an accurate and complete credit report. The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the information in credit reports is both fair and accurate. Inaccurate or incomplete information must be corrected o

r removed. Moreover, the FCRA requires t hat any reported late payments must be accurate and substantiated. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c, late payments must reflect the true nature of the account status. If a late payment entry is incorrect or outdated, it should be promptly rectified.

Failure to comply with these requirements can be considered willful non-compliance under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, which addresses the responsibilities of credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate records and the legal repercussions for failing to do so.

In light of these legal obligations, I request the following information regarding the reinvestigation process : The specific procedures Experian will follow to verify the accuracy of the reported charge-off and any related late payments.

How can you say you call the company and verified reporting inaccurate information? 3. How can you close the same account twice at the same time on a credit report? 4. How can the last payment be five ( 5 ) different dates and year???

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I filed a complaint on XX/XX/year>, XXXX. and I am writing to formally dispute the account associated with the credit card account ending in XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$12000.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account number XXXX in the amount of {$11000.00} and XXXX  account number XXXX in the amount of {$920.00} which is fraudulently reporting on my credit report. I have repeatedly notified your company that this account does not belong to me and that it was opened without my knowledge or consent. Despite my numerous attempts to resolve this issue, the fraudulent account continues to appear on my credit report with late payments and as a charge-off, severely damaging my credit score. Violations of My Rights : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violations : Under the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I have the right to dispute inaccurate information in my credit report. Your continued reporting of this fraudulent account, despite my numerous disputes, violates my right to have inaccurate or unverifiable information corrected or removed. The FCRA mandates that once a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any item of information, the furnisher ( in this case, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) must conduct a reasonable investigation. Failure to do so or continuing to report inaccurate information constitutes a direct violation of this federal law. 2. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) Violations : According to the GLBA, particularly 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to protect the privacy of nonpublic personal information and to provide notice before disclosing such information to nonaffiliated third parties. The fact that this account was fraudulently opened under my name suggests a breach of your duty to safeguard my personal information. This failure has resulted in unauthorized access to my sensitive data, further compounding the violation of my rights under the GLBA. 3. Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) Violations : The ECOA, under 15 U.S.C. 1691, explicitly prohibits creditors from discriminating against any applicant who exercises their rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. By refusing to remove this fraudulent account and continuing to report it negatively on my credit, despite my rightful disputes, you are effectively discriminating against me for exercising my rights under federal law. This discrimination, in turn, subjects you to penalties and legal consequences under the ECOA. Actions Requested : Given the clear violations of my rights under these federal statutes, I am formally requesting the following actions : 1. Immediate Removal of the Fraudulent Account : I demand that the fraudulent car loan account be removed from my credit report immediately. This includes removing all associated negative marks, such as late payments and the charge-off status. 2. Cease All Collection Activities : I request that you cease any collection activities related to this fraudulent account, as I did not authorize this loan or any related transactions. 3. Investigation and Response : I request a thorough investigation into this matter, including how my personal information was compromised and how this fraudulent account was opened. Please provide a detailed response outlining the steps taken during the investigation and the results. 4. Confirmation of Action Taken : Once the fraudulent account is removed from my credit report, I request that you provide written confirmation of the removal and any other corrective actions taken. Failure to Honor Request and Discrimination : If you fail to honor my request for the removal of this fraudulent account and continue to report inaccurate information on my credit report, it will be a violation of my rights under the FCRA. Additionally, if you discriminate against me in any way for exercising my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1691 ), I will pursue all available legal remedies. According to the ECOA : It shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transactionbecause the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. Discrimination for exercising my rights is strictly prohibited under federal law and may result in further legal action. Please consider this letter as my formal notice and request for immediate action under the relevant provisions of the FCRA, GLBA, and ECOA. If this issue is not resolved within 30 days, I will be forced to escalate this matter by filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and possibly pursuing legal action.

Summary of Violations : I previously filed a complaint with the CFPB under Complaint ID XXXX, opened on XX/XX/year> and closed on XX/XX/year>, regarding NetCredit 's failure to provide proof of debt as required by law. 

On XX/XX/year>, I sent a dispute letter to NetCredit via USPS tracking # XXXX, and again on XX/XX/year>, via USPS tracking # XXXX. In both disputes, I explicitly requested in writing, under 15 U.S. Code 1692c ( c ) - Ceasing Communication, that no telephone contact be made by NetCredit to my home or place of employment. 

Despite this, NetCredit has repeatedly harassed me with telephone calls on XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>. These actions are in direct violation of the FDCPA. 

Legal Basis for the Complaint : Under 15 U.S. Code 1692c ( c ) - Ceasing Communication : If a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that they refuse to pay a debt or that they wish the debt collector to cease further communication, the debt collector shall not communicate further with the consumer regarding the debt, except under certain conditions. 
NetCredit has failed to comply with this legal requirement by continuing to contact me via telephone, despite my clear written request to cease such communication. 

Request for Action : Given these violations, I request that the CFPB take the following actions : Investigate NetCredit 's repeated violations of the FDCPA. 
Impose appropriate penalties for their non-compliance. 
Ensure that all future communications from NetCredit are conducted in writing, as requested. 
Attached Documentation : To support my complaint, I have attached the following documentation : Copies of the dispute letters were sent to NetCredit with USPS tracking numbers. 
A record of the dates and times of the harassing phone calls from NetCredit. 
I trust that the CFPB will take appropriate action to address these violations and ensure NetCredit 's compliance with federal law. 

Please consider this letter as notice of intent to file a lawsuit, where I reserve my legal right to start litigation without providing future notice.

This issue has caused significant distress and potential harm to my financial standing. Despite my best efforts to resolve this matter directly, the situation remains unresolved, prompting me to seek your intervention.

2. **15 USC 1666b - Prompt Crediting of Payments : ** Payments associated with this account have not been credited in a timely manner, violating this statute, leading to erroneous reporting and unjust financial consequences.

3. **15 USC 1681b - Permissible Purposes of Consumer Reports : ** CREDIT COLLECTION SERV may have accessed my credit report without a legitimate, permissible purpose, violating the guidelines of this statute.

4. **15 USC 1605 - Determination of Finance Charge : ** The finance charges applied to this account may not have been calculated in accordance with the law, in violation of this section of the USC .

5. **15 USC 1681s-2 ( a ) - Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information : ** This statute requires furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information they report. The reporting by CREDIT COLLECTION SERV appears to violate this responsibility.

6. **15 USC 1692e - False or Misleading Representations : ** This section prohibits debt collectors from using any false, deceptive, or misleading representations. The reporting of this account by CREDIT COLLECTION SERV may involve such misrepresentation.

7. **15 USC 1692g ( b ) - Disputed Debts : ** Under this section, if a debt is disputed by the consumer, the debt collector must cease collection until the debt is verified. I have not received sufficient verification of this debt, and the continued reporting of this account violates this statute.

8. **15 USC 1681e ( b ) - Compliance Procedures : ** This section requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information reported. The presence of this disputed account on my report indicates a failure to adhere to these procedures.

Given the numerous potential violations of federal law, I respectfully request that the CFPB conduct a thorough investigation into this matter. I am seeking the immediate removal of this erroneous account from my credit report and a review of the practices employed by CREDIT COLLECTION SERV to prevent future violations.

This issue is of utmost importance to me, and I trust that the CFPB will take swift and decisive action to rectify this situation. Please keep me informed of the progress and outcome of your investigation.

Capital one was notified and still hasnt taken off my credit as of yet. If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer 's file. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ). Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ). I continually receive emails about the debt of my twin brother XXXX XXXX we have similar names being that I am XXXX XXXX. Our socials are similar and only are XXXX number apart. The emails include my brothers name but continue to be sent to my credit report. Law 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x states The Act ( Title VI of the Consumer Credit Protection Act ) protects information collected by consumer reporting agencies such as credit bureaus, medical information companies and tenant screening services. Information in a consumer report can not be provided to anyone who does not have a purpose specified in the Act. Companies that provide information to consumer reporting agencies also have specific legal obligations, including the duty to investigate disputed information. In addition, users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes must notify the consumer when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act added many provisions to this Act primarily relating to record accuracy and identity theft. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau most of the rulemaking responsibilities added to this Act by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Credit CARD Act, but the Commission retains all its enforcement authority. All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623 ( a ) ( 6 ). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each consumer reporting agency of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). When any furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances.

Account number XXXX A bankruptcy discharge is granted by the bankruptcy court to release the debtor permanently from personal liability for certain specified types of debts. In other words, the debtor is no longer legally required to pay any debts that are discharged. The debtor will usually automatically receive a discharge, excepting there is litigation involving objections to the discharge. The discharge prohibits the creditors from taking any form of collection action on discharged debts, including legal action and communications with the debtor. If a creditor attempts collection efforts on a discharged debt, the debtor can file a motion with the court, reporting the action and asking that the case be reopened to address the matter. A creditor can be sanctioned by the court for violating the discharge injunction.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,GA,30228,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9777416

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I write to you with deep concern and dissatisfaction regarding the unauthorized inclusion of information in my consumer report, a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681b. This letter serves as an official dispute, urging your agency to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into this serious breach of my rights. 

Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX I am writing to dispute the accuracy of the information contained in my consumer credit report. Upon recent review, I have discovered entries that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), particularly Section 611, which mandates the maximum possible accuracy of information in a consumer 's file. 

Furthermore, the entries in question were reported without my written permission, contravening the requirements outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) of the FCRA. As such, I request an immediate, comprehensive, and impartial investigation into these entries. I expect a detailed response outlining the findings of this investigation, including the original written instructions from me ( Consumer ) with my wet signature.

Moreover, I am not aware of any legitimate purpose for reporting these late payments, and I affirm that I did not authorize the reporting of such information to your agency. Therefore, in accordance with Section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the FCRA, I demand a thorough investigation into these disputed late payments, along with written confirmation of the investigation 's completion and details of any actions taken to rectify this matter.

Additionally, I request documentation, including the periodic statement and tracking number, to prove that each periodic statement was delivered to me at least 21 days before the payment due date, as mandated by 15 U.S. Code 1666b.

I request that you provide me with the name and address of the person ( s ) that you contacted to allegedly verify the information that I have rightfully disputed. 

Failure to comply with the legal requirements outlined in this letter will necessitate pursuing all available legal remedies to address this violation of my rights under the FCRA. I trust that your agency will approach this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. 

FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : You are continuing to report fraudulent accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me, which is a clear infringement upon my privacy rights. As I mentioned before, I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. I insist that my hard inquiries and account information not be shared on my credit report.

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : The information you continue to report falsely suggests that I applied for multiple inquiries and accounts, when in reality, these were the result of a scammer\ 's actions. This misleading and unverified reporting is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and its fairness requirements.

FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Despite my previous dispute, you have failed to verify the accuracy of the credit information you have accepted, thereby demonstrating willful noncompliance. This non-compliance is subject to civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation. 

FCRA Section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information : You have yet to fulfill your obligation to disclose my right to opt out of sharing my personal information. This omission is deceptive and a direct violation of my consumer rights. 

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Furnishing Deceptive Forms : Despite my previous dispute, you persist in furnishing inaccurate inquiries and accounts without proper validation, which potentially violates Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Reporting such deceptive information is unacceptable In addition to the aforementioned violations, I remind you of the previous violations outlined in my initial dispute letter, including the violation of Debt Collection Practices Act, Identity Theft Laws, Acquiring Location Information Regulations, Timely Payments Regulations, Finance Charge Determination, and Credit Report Permissible Purposes. These violations require your immediate attention and resolution.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,". Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Information on Credit Report and Detailed Description of Verification Methods Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the handling of my credit report dispute by Experian XXXX, and XXXX. Despite my efforts to resolve inaccuracies on my credit report, I have encountered several issues that I believe warrant further investigation by the CFPB. 
Background : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a dispute to Experian XXXX, and XXXX regarding inaccurate information on my credit report. The items in question were not properly verified, yet the agency concluded that the information was accurate. I am concerned about the thoroughness and accuracy of their reinvestigation process. 
Details of the Complaint : XXXX. Inadequate Verification Process : Despite my detailed dispute, the credit reporting agency failed to verify the accuracy of the disputed information adequately. The verification process seems to lack transparency and thoroughness, which raises concerns about its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
XXXX. Lack of Detailed Verification Methods : I requested a detailed description of the verification methods used by the credit reporting agency, including the specific procedures, sources consulted, documentation reviewed, and criteria for validation. However, this information has not been provided, despite multiple requests. 
XXXX. Timeline of Investigation : There is a lack of clarity on the timeline of the investigation, including key dates and actions taken during the process. This lack of transparency hinders my ability to understand how the investigation was conducted and whether it adhered to FCRA requirements.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30157,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9761205

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I logged into my credit card app, which shows my XXXX XXXX  credit score, to discover that it had dropped XXXX points. It was XXXX, so it has effectively been ruined. Apparently XXXX reported to Experian that I had a derogatory account, with a balance of {$350.00} dollars. It states that the account with XXXX was opened in XXXX of 2024 and closed in XXXX of 2024. I have no account with XXXX at all. My father has XXXX, and I am on a family plan with him, but the account is on autopay and is linked to his credit card and SSN. This would in no way impact my score ( plus the payments are up to date ). I called XXXX just to confirm what I already knew, that I had no account with them. They found nothing in their systems under my name and SSN. I filed a dispute with Experian. It makes you create an account with them before you can file a dispute. I noticed after I put my name and social in that it auto-populated my address and asked if the information was accurate. It was not, it was some address in XXXX, VA that I have never lived at in my entire life. I corrected the information and proceeded to file my dispute. It should also be noted that if you look through all of my accounts, not XXXX has ever been late or derogatory, and all of a sudden this XXXX one just pops up. Clearly something is wrong, whether it be a typo or fraud. I just received the results, and they are continuing to say that their information is accurate. I am beyond frustrated as it has ruined my credit and is completely false. Both Experian and XXXX have done little to help, and it seems their is a breakdown somewhere. If I have no account with XXXX, then how could they report a derogatory account with my SSN? Experian clearly did nothing, as I filed the dispute on Friday and received results on a Sunday. I have tried multiple times to call Experian, and it is impossible to speak to a live human being.

You must finish your information verification within a reasonable time frame and be able to evaluate and confirm all of the information in my credit report. My credit history, as well as the following information, have never been validated or correctly reported. I will exercise my consumer rights by requesting that factually truthful, verifiable, and compliant data be obtained and placed on my credit report. I also require that any mistakes be fixed permanently. Below is a summary of the data in which I am challenging : XXXX. XXXX Inquiry date - XX/XX/XXXX Equifax XXXX.

XXXX XXXX Inquiry date - XX/XX/XXXX Equifax XXXX. XXXX Inquiry date - XX/XX/XXXX Equifax XXXX. XXXX Inquiry date - XX/XX/XXXX Equifax Summary of Inquiries being challenged in list form I received a credit report from you that showed a few unfamiliar companies. It looks like they put an inquiry on my file without my knowledge, but this shouldn't be possible unless it was something approved by me first. Under U.S. Code, 15, U.S.C 1681 es seq. Section 604, all users must have a permissible purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to obtain a consumer report. Please have this inquiry removed from my credit file or forward me documentation ( physical proof ) that you have proven permissible purpose for this inquiry. I am reporting that there are some negative items in my credit profile, and I have confirmed that they are not accurate. I dispute these claims and demand that any negative information be removed from the reports immediately. The claims that this information in my report is negative, untrue, incorrect, incomplete, untimely, and not verifiable are unsubstantiated. I have yet to be provided physical verifiable proof that the claims of negativity within my report are true. After reviewing my report, I noticed several deviations from mandatory reporting standards therefore the data in my report can not be accurate and complete! With that said, I refute your allegations and challenge you to provide proof that you have the right to report this incomplete negative information about me. Document that you have complied with the reporting requirements, and report without any deviations. If you have not complied with the requirements or there are any negative aspects below that have been challenged, you must remove them from my report. Per 15 U.S.C 1681e Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates "" Also per 12 CFR Part 1022 ( Regulation V ) requires furnishers to : A - Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity. B - Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate. C - Conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes According to XXXX, in order to make a lawful report, you must follow the Metro 2 compliance standards. Also as stated in the XXXX Any Deviation From These Standards Jeopardizes the Integrity of The Data. This means that any mistakes in reporting claims can make the information less accurate. This is important to remember because it affects the accuracy of any federally regulated reports. With that said! I found some mistakes and inaccuracies in your report, and I would like to invoke my rights to dispute/challenge these inaccurate and non-compliant items. If you continue to report claims that are not perfect, it shows that you do not care about my rights as a consumer.I don't think it's fair for you to report on me in a way that isn't confirmed to be ethical and meets the standards of certified reporting.The following claims about me were not reported correctly and do not meet federal requirements. I am challenging these claims and asking for proof that the proper reporting standards were followed. I found credit inquiries on my credit report that I don't remember authorizing. This could be a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and a serious breach of my privacy rights. I would like you to investigate this and get back to me with documentation of these inquiries with my signature on them. If they are found to be fraudulent, I would like them immediately deleted from my credit file. Appreciatively I have listed the concerns I have about your reporting in this document. It is not complete and does not meet my standards. According to the law, you and the data furnishers must certify all aspects of the required FCRA and Metro 2 compliance. This must be done in a truthful, correct, complete, and timely manner as to not violate my consumer and civil rights. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 611 of FCRA, credit bureaus have a responsibility to delete any information from credit reports which is inaccurate or incomplete. This is important to note, as even if an account has only been speculated upon or never confirmed in any way, the burden falls on the credit bureau to provide evidence of its veracity before it can be placed on a credit report. If the information in a credit report is wrong, it was never proven to be factual, and the consumer has the right to take legal action against the credit bureau. Inquiries from a company that I don't remember authorizing need be deleted expeditiously. I understand that you shouldn't be allowed to put an inquiry on my credit file without my authorization, so please remove these inquiries from my credit file immediately. Please forward me documentation that you have investigated and removed the unauthorized inquiries. Appreciatively You are violating my rights! I have listed the concerns about your reporting in this document. It's not complete and does not meet my standards ; according to law, you must certify all aspects of required FCRA/ Metro 2 compliance which is done truthfully, correctly ( in a timely manner ), completely AND accurately as well - or else I would have to escalate these issues to the CFPB , FTC and my Attorney General XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Please send your written response to my address of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX FL XXXX",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33313,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9817658

Under 15 U.S. Code 1692e of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), debt collectors must not use false, deceptive, or misleading representations. The absence of a direct contract between myself and XXXX XXXX XXXX invalidates the reporting of this debt on my credit report. 

Inaccurate Reporting : The FCRA mandates that all information on a consumer 's credit report must be accurate and verifiable. The information reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX, including the balance and status of this account, is inaccurate. Furthermore, the account was reported as "" Seriously past due '' without sufficient evidence or verification of the debt. 

Potential Consumer Rights Violation : Reporting this account as derogatory without a valid contract and sufficient evidence may constitute a violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA. The lack of detailed payment history and unclear status updates further questions the legality of this reporting.

Request for Resolution : I request that [ Credit Bureau Name ] conduct a thorough investigation into this matter. If you are unable to verify the accuracy and legality of this information, I demand that this collections account be removed from my credit report immediately.

Please notify me of the outcome of your investigation within the 30-day period as required by the FCRA. If the investigation reveals that the information is inaccurate, I request that the account be removed from my credit report and that I be provided with an updated copy of my report.

The lawsuit will filed due to the utter lack of response from your company. When someone is the victim of identity theft, it is simply a nightmare trying to get false information removed from a credit file. I have contacted all of the false creditors listed on my credit file. I have challenged all of the false listings on my credit file. Nothing ever happens to fix the situation. Over 90 days ago I wrote each the creditors in question and demanded proof that I am their customer. I asked for proof of the alleged debt, including specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. So far none of them has been able to provide such proof to me. I have sent follow-up letters to each of them and there is still no proof. I have attempted phone contact, but I simply get transferred around and nothing ever gets accomplished. I have fully investigated my rights in this matter. Under the doctrine of estoppel by silence, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I may presume that no proof of the alleged debt, nor therefore any such debt, in fact exists. I have copies of the certified letters and dates prepared to bring to court. Also, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, these disputed items may not appear on my credit report if they can not be supported by any evidence. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if they can not verify the debt within 30 days, then it must be removed. Your letters to me claim to have "" verified '' the debt, but this is in fact not true under law. Simply contacting the alleged creditor and asking them to match up numbers in their database is no sufficient verification for identity theft. Of course the information matches up. Someone clearly used my information without my authorization. Now I am suing EQUIFAX for being such a pain in the posterior to me. I have provided more than sufficient evidence to get these false accounts removed. Feel free to reach out to address this issue before it escalates legally.. via letter at my address listed at the top of this letter. This matter can be settled simply by your agreement to remove the false information from my credit file. I require a response, on point, in writing, hand signed, and in a timely manner. If I get another pointless letter from you saying that it has already been "" verified '' then there will be no more opportunity for negotiation. This will proceed in court until I have successfully proven to a judge that this false information must be removed from my credit file. I will also be aggressively pursuing the full judgment that I can get against EQUIFAX for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Defamation.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am reaching out to you in a state of utter desperation. The inaccuracies on my credit report have shattered my dreams, torn apart my sense of security, and left me in a constant state of anxiety. My life is unraveling before my eyes, and I dont know where else to turn. 

I recently filed complaints ( Complaint IDs : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) concerning several accounts that are inaccurately reported on my credit file. Despite my best efforts, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX have told me they can not even find my accounts, leaving me helpless in providing details that I dont have. How can I defend myself against something they claim doesnt exist? 

Because of these errors, my life is falling apart. The car I need to go to work and the home Ive dreamt of owning are both slipping through my fingers. I am mentally and emotionally broken. The weight of this situation is unbearable, and I fear that it could destroy everything Ive worked so hard to build. 

The accounts in question are as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX These accounts are wrongly holding me XXXX, violating my federally protected rights to privacy and confidentiality under 15 USC 1681. I reviewed my XXXX credit report on XXXX XXXX XXXX, and was devastated to find glaring inaccuracies that are completely beyond my control. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 USC 1681 ( e ) ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are legally required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports. Additionally, under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), if disputed information is found to be inaccurate or unverifiable, it must be promptly deleted or corrected. And yet, despite these clear legal protections, I remain trapped in this nightmare.

Furthermore, under 15 USC 1681s-2, furnishers are prohibited from providing information they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. And yet, my life is being destroyed by false information that continues to haunt me. 

My Previous Complaint Details : Complaint ID : XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ID : XXXX ( XXXX ) Complaint ID : XXXX ( Equifax ) These complaints remain unresolved, and the inaccuracies persist, wreaking havoc on my life. I am begging youplease, remove this inaccurate information from my credit report. I feel like Im drowning in a sea of injustice, with no way out. This is not just a matter of numbers on a report ; this is my life, my future, and my sanity at stake. I can not bear this burden any longer. 

Please help me fix this before its too late. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MA,024XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9761195

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I write to you with deep concern and dissatisfaction regarding the unauthorized inclusion of information in my consumer report, a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681b. This letter serves as an official dispute, urging your agency to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into this serious breach of my rights. 

XXXX XXXX I am writing to dispute the accuracy of information contained in my consumer credit report. Upon recent review, I have discovered entries that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), particularly Section 611, which mandates the maximum possible accuracy of information in a consumer 's file. 

Furthermore, the entries in question were reported without my written permission, contravening the requirements outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) of the FCRA. As such, I request an immediate, comprehensive, and impartial investigation into these entries. I expect a detailed response outlining the findings of this investigation, including the original written instructions from me ( Consumer ) with my wet signature. 

Moreover, I am not aware of any legitimate purpose for reporting these late payments, and I affirm that I did not authorize the reporting of such information to your agency. Therefore, in accordance with Section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the FCRA, I demand a thorough investigation into these disputed late payments, along with written confirmation of the investigation 's completion and details of any actions taken to rectify this matter. 

Additionally, I request documentation, including the periodic statement and tracking number, to prove that each periodic statement was delivered to me at least 21 days before the payment due date, as mandated by 15 U.S. Code 1666b.

I request that you provide me with the name and address of the person ( s ) that you contacted to allegedly verify the information that I have rightfully disputed. 

Failure to comply with the legal requirements outlined in this letter will necessitate pursuing all available legal remedies to address this violation of my rights under the FCRA. I trust that your agency will approach this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. 

FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : You are continuing to report fraudulent accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me, which is a clear infringement upon my privacy rights. As I mentioned before, I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. I insist that my hard inquiries and account information not be shared on my credit report. 

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : The information you continue to report falsely suggests that I applied for multiple inquiries and accounts, when in reality, these were the result of a scammer\ 's actions. This misleading and unverified reporting is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and its fairness requirements. 

FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Despite my previous dispute, you have failed to verify the accuracy of the credit information you have accepted, thereby demonstrating willful noncompliance. This noncompliance is subject to civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation. 

FCRA Section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information : You have yet to fulfill your obligation to disclose my right to opt out of sharing my personal information. This omission is deceptive and a direct violation of my consumer rights. 

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Furnishing Deceptive Forms : Despite my previous dispute, you persist in furnishing inaccurate inquiries and accounts without proper validation, which potentially violates Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Reporting such deceptive information is unacceptable In addition to the aforementioned violations, I remind you of the previous violations outlined in my initial dispute letter, including the violation of Debt Collection Practices Act, Identity Theft Laws, Acquiring Location Information Regulations, Timely Payments Regulations, Finance Charge Determination, and Credit Report Permissible Purposes. These violations require your immediate attention and resolution. 

The entries in question were reported without my written permission, contravening the requirements outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) of the FCRA. As such, I request an immediate, comprehensive, and impartial investigation into these entries. I expect a detailed response outlining the findings of this investigation, including the original written instructions from me ( Consumer ) with my wet signature.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MA,02125,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9761020

2. **Lack of Proper Investigation** : Despite my repeated disputes over the past several years, the credit reporting agency has not conducted a proper investigation or corrected the inaccurate information, violating Section 611 ( a ) of the FCRA.

It is important to note that this dispute was not sent by an unauthorized third party or credit clinic, '' I am writing to address the ongoing violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) that have yet to be resolved, despite my previous dispute letter. The violations are as follows : FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : You are continuing to report fraudulent accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me, which is a clear infringement upon my privacy rights. As I mentioned before, I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. I insist that my hard inquiries and account information not be shared on my credit report. FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : The information you continue to report falsely suggests that I applied for multiple inquiries and accounts, when in reality, these were the result of a scammer 's actions. This misleading and unverified reporting is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and its fairness requirements. FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Despite my previous dispute, you have failed to verify the accuracy of the credit information you have accepted, thereby demonstrating willful noncompliance. This noncompliance is subject to civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation. FCRA Section 605B - Aggravated Identity Theft : Your continued sharing of my personal information with numerous creditors without obtaining my consent is a criminal act of aggravated identity theft. I remind you that this offense carries a penalty of up to 2 years of imprisonment. FCRA Section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information : You have yet to fulfill your obligation to disclose my right to opt out of sharing my personal information. This omission is deceptive and a direct violation of my consumer rights. FORA Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Furnishing Deceptive Forms : Despite my previous dispute, you persist in furnishing inaccurate inquiries and accounts without proper validation, which potentially violates Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Reporting such deceptive information is unacceptable In addition to the aforementioned violations, I remind you of the previous violations outlined in my initial dispute letter, including the violation of Debt Collection Practices Act, Identity Theft Laws, Acquiring Location Information Regulations, Timely Payments Regulations, Finance Charge Determination, and Credit Report Permissible Purposes. These violations require your immediate attention and resolution. Once again, I demand that you take immediate action to address these violations and fulfill the following requests : Unauthorized inquiry : XXXX  Date of inquiry : XX/XX/2022 DELETE!!!",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",CA,95822,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9761953

Account Information : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Account Number : XXXX Amount : {$480.00} I previously submitted a dispute to Equifax regarding the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account. Despite providing evidence supporting the inaccuracies and requesting its removal from my credit report, Equifax failed to conduct a thorough investigation and the disputed account remains on my credit report. 

As a consumer protected under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to request the removal of inaccurate or outdated information from my credit report. Equifax failure to comply with this law is a violation of my consumer rights and has caused me financial harm and distress. 

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Equifax for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate removal of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Equifax upholds its obligations under the law.

2024-08-11,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Changes in loan terms during the application process,"Id like to file a formal complaint into NFCUs illegally accessing my bank, XXXX and illegally taking money out of my accounts without my permission and engaging in unfair lending and dept collection practices NOW and in the Past, as this is retaliation for reporting NFCU for discrimination and unfair lending practices and dept collection with my HELO application from XX/XX/year>. 

Recently, on XX/XX/year>, I was contacted by NFCU claiming that my HELO had not been paid since XX/XX/year>, and stated on a recorded line that I was over {$1000.00} dollars in arears. I manually pay my HELO monthly out of my XXXX account and I have faithfully paid all NFCU bills that were sent to me. 

I do not trust NFCU to access my accounts, as I was discriminated against by XXXX when applying for this HELO and subjected to unfair lending and dept collection practices when NFCU tried to force me to sign loan documents without disclosing the terms of that agreement because they had added 3-interest points as I was a single female and didnt have a man as a co-signer or a man on my propertys title. 

When I tried on XX/XX/year> to access my accounts online, NFCU had locked me out of all my accounts. After 2 hours on the phone, I gained access to my account, only to learn that they had denied my XX/XX/year> payment from XXXX, a payment in full for XX/XX/year> of {$380.00}. While on the phone with NFCU, I submitted payment of {$500.00} to cover XX/XX/year> and any fees they were going to charge me. 

Without my permission, NFCU withdrew both {$500.00} and {$380.00} from my XXXX account. I complained to the online representative that it was illegal to withdraw funds from my account without my permission. The representative told me, on a recorded line, that it was NFCU policy to take 2 months, the XXXX and the XXXX payment. I reminded him that he did not have my permission to take next months payment out of my XXXX account and I wanted that amount returned to my XXXX account. He refused to refund my money. The representative stated that the XX/XX/year> payment NFCU had illegally withdrew from my XXXX account would be posted as my XX/XX/year> payment. It was not! Now I am now being called by NFCU collections claiming my account is in arrears. 

This bank/credit union is engaging in illegal acts, unfair leading practices, and they have openly preyed upon me and discriminated against me. I have only had this HELO since XX/XX/year>- and they can not stop retaliatory harassing me. 

What I would like as a remedy to their retaliatory and unabated and uncorrected discrimination, harassment, and unfair lending and dept collection practices is for NFCU to forgive in total my HELO and close it. And or for NFCU pay all fees/loan points associated with moving all my NFCU accounts, saving/checking, Home Loan, and HELO to another lending institution of my choosing, one that does not engage in illegal acts against its customers and members. And with both both options, they must repair any damage they have done to my credit history. 

I will agree to sever all ties now and future with NFCU, when they agree and comply with the above remedy.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,WA,XXXXX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,9777137

Despite my numerous efforts to provide ample and irrefutable evidence proving the error, these credit bureaus have unacceptably continued to display this erroneous information.

This process began in XXXX of 2023, yes a full year and they have not resolved it, where I disputed with the court ( attached ). The court states that it doe snot supply information to the Bureaus. I submitted Disputed to XXXX, XXXX, and Transunion on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, to no avail. When they finally sent information back, they stated that it is verified by a 3rd party called XXXX XXXX. So I submitted a dispute to XXXX XXXX in XXXX. XXXX XXXX said I was correct about the inaccurate bankruptcy and removed it from their files ( attached documentation ). I submitted another Dispute to the bureaus in XXXX with the letters sent by XXXX XXXX and Trans Union said it was verified, which is impossible. XXXX and XXXX did not even respond ( illegals ) Here is a summary of the egregious missteps by the credit bureaus : Failure to Correct Errors : Despite providing all necessary evidence, each bureau has inexplicably failed to correct the inaccuracy. Their responses have been dismissive and inadequate, lacking any substantive action to rectify the mistake.

Negligent Handling of Disputes : The process followed by the credit bureaus in handling my dispute has been grossly inefficient and unprofessional. Their failure to resolve the dispute in a timely manner reflects a troubling disregard for consumer rights.

Impact on Creditworthiness : The erroneous bankruptcy record is significantly damaging my creditworthiness and, consequently, my financial stability. This ongoing issue has led to undue stress and has negatively impacted my ability to secure credit.

I demand immediate action to rectify this situation. Specifically, I require : Prompt Removal : Immediate removal of the inaccurate bankruptcy entry from all three credit reports.

Written Confirmation : Written confirmation from each credit bureau acknowledging the removal and detailing the corrective actions taken.

Investigation and Accountability : A thorough investigation into the handling of my dispute, including a detailed explanation of why my evidence was ignored and what measures will be implemented to prevent such issues in the future.

If these demands are not met within 15 days from the date of this letter, I will be compelled to escalate this matter further, including but not limited to seeking legal redress and filing formal complaints with additional regulatory bodies.

The lack of action and accountability from XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion is unacceptable and reflects a serious breach of my consumer rights. I trust that the CFPB will act swiftly to ensure that this matter is resolved with the seriousness it warrants.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",IL,606XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9761348

you furnished to { XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX } } an alleged transaction as Late.

15 U.S. Code 1666b - Timing of payments ( a ) TIME TO MAKE PAYMENTS Acreditormay not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless thecreditorhas adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required bysection 1637 ( b ) of this titleis mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

I requested the information that must have or possess by law in order for you to furnish a payment as late.

This is being request pursuant rule 1002. 
In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the conditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met. 
You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late. 
It has been over 30 days and you have not properly verify the information. 

Id. at 1303 ; see also Blacks Law Dictionary ( 11th ed. 2019 ) ( defining verify as [ t ] o prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate ). 
Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified.

Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1304. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account. 
Delete the information you are furnishing to the Consumer Reporting Agencies as late from account.

It is important to note that this dispute was not sent by an unauthorized third party or credit clinic, '' I am writing to address the ongoing violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) that have yet to be resolved, despite my previous dispute letter. The violations are as follows : FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : You are continuing to report fraudulent accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me, which is a clear infringement upon my privacy rights. As I mentioned before, I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. I insist that my hard inquiries and account information not be shared on my credit report. FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : The information you continue to report falsely suggests that I applied for multiple inquiries and accounts, when in reality, these were the result of a scammer 's actions. This misleading and unverified reporting is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and its fairness requirements. FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Despite my previous dispute, you have failed to verify the accuracy of the credit information you have accepted, thereby demonstrating willful noncompliance. This noncompliance is subject to civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation.

The lawsuit will filed due to the utter lack of response from your company. When someone is the victim of identity theft, it is simply a nightmare trying to get false information removed from a credit file. I have contacted all of the false creditors listed on my credit file. I have challenged all of the false listings on my credit file. Nothing ever happens to fix the situation. Over 90 days ago I wrote each the creditors in question and demanded proof that I am their customer. I asked for proof of the alleged debt, including specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. So far none of them has been able to provide such proof to me. I have sent follow-up letters to each of them and there is still no proof. I have attempted phone contact, but I simply get transferred around and nothing ever gets accomplished. I have fully investigated my rights in this matter. Under the doctrine of estoppel by silence, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I may presume that no proof of the alleged debt, nor therefore any such debt, in fact exists. I have copies of the certified letters and dates prepared to bring to court. Also, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, these disputed items may not appear on my credit report if they can not be supported by any evidence. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if they can not verify the debt within 30 days, then it must be removed. Your letters to me claim to have "" verified '' the debt, but this is in fact not true under law. Simply contacting the alleged creditor and asking them to match up numbers in their database is no sufficient verification for identity theft. Of course the information matches up. Someone clearly used my information without my authorization. Now I am suing TRANSUNION for being such a pain in the posterior to me. I have provided more than sufficient evidence to get these false accounts removed. Feel free to reach out to address this issue before it escalates legally.. via letter at my address listed at the top of this letter. This matter can be settled simply by your agreement to remove the false information from my credit file. I require a response, on point, in writing, hand signed, and in a timely manner. If I get another pointless letter from you saying that it has already been "" verified '' then there will be no more opportunity for negotiation. This will proceed in court until I have successfully proven to a judge that this false information must be removed from my credit file. I will also be aggressively pursuing the full judgment that I can get against TRANSUNION for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Defamation.

Identification of Inaccuracies : Upon reviewing my credit report, I have identified several inaccuracies that have adversely affected my financial standing. These inaccuracies include : incorrect balance, late payments, account number, credit limit, date of reported and others inconsistencies. 

Impact on My Financial Well-being : The inaccuracies outlined above have severely affected my creditworthiness and overall financial health. In XX/XX/XXXX, I experienced a major financial setback due to a family emergency, which led me to apply for a personal loan with XXXX XXXX  and other creditors offered loans with significantly high interest rates and I have been wrongfully denied which was highly embarrassing and has negatively impacted my lifestyle. This misinformation has had a detrimental impact on my financial options and opportunities. Would you reinvestigate the accounts listed below. 

Account Name : XXXX XXXX  XXXX Number : XXXX Reinvestigate the completeness of every piece of information and if its not accurate, please remove it from my credit report. 

Reference to Relevant Laws : I believe that these inaccuracies violate consumer protection laws, including but not limited to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The FCRA mandates accurate reporting and stipulates that consumers have the right to dispute and correct inaccuracies on their credit reports. 
Based of consumer law 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy, if within 30 days you can not verify the accuracy of the information, please remove the account from my credit report. 

Request for Thorough Investigation : I kindly request that TransUnion conducts a thorough investigation into the inaccuracies outlined above and takes immediate corrective action. I believe that rectifying these errors is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the credit reporting system and upholding consumer rights. 

Potential Legal Consequences : Please be advised that if these violations are not addressed promptly, I may be compelled to take legal action to protect my rights under the FCRA and other applicable laws. 

Optionally with the proof I am attaching to this letter, you will agree it needs to be removed ASA. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request that you keep me informed of the progress of your investigation. 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) REINVESTIGATIONS OF DISPUTED INFORMATION ( 1 ) REINVESTIGATION REQUIRED ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in aconsumersfileat aconsumer reporting agencyis disputed by theconsumerand theconsumernotifies the agency directly, or indirectly through XXXX, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate XXXX current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from XXXX accordance with paragraph ( XXXX ), before the end of the XXXX period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from XXXX. 

Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified.

Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1304. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account.

The account in question is from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a collections company, with which I have no contractual relationship. Specifically, the details are as follows : Account Number : XXXX Balance : {$2400.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/year> Payment Status : Seriously past due/ Assigned to attorney, collection agency, or credit grantor 's internal collection department Last Reported : XX/XX/year> Dispute Basis : No Contractual Relationship : Under 15 U.S. Code 1692e of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), debt collectors are required to report accurate information and must not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representations. I do not have any contractual agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which invalidates the reporting of this debt on my credit report. 

Inaccurate Reporting of Debt : The FCRA mandates that all information on a consumer 's credit report must be accurate and verifiable. Since there is no contract or agreement between myself and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the accuracy of this reported debt is in question. Additionally, the absence of payment history and the derogatory information reported without adequate evidence further violates the FCRA. 

Potential Violation of Consumer Rights : The continued reporting of this account as derogatory, without proper verification and in the absence of a valid contract, may constitute a violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA. Additionally, the failure to provide complete information about the payment history and the terms of the alleged debt raises concerns about the legality of this reporting.

Request for Resolution : I request that [ Credit Bureau Name ] conduct a thorough investigation into this matter. If you are unable to verify the accuracy and legality of this information, I demand that this collections account be removed from my credit report immediately.

Please notify me of the outcome of your investigation within the 30-day period as required by the FCRA. If the investigation reveals that the information is inaccurate, I request that the account be removed from my credit report and that I be provided with an updated copy of my report.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If further information or documentation is required, please do not hesitate to contact me.

XXXX XXXX has single handedly ruined my credit. My FICO went from over XXXX to XXXX overnight. I have been dealing with this for XXXX years and now its XXXX that the credit reporting agencies help get these wrong accounts off my credit report. XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX The XXXX XXXX XXXX listed here is not my credit card number. I have asked for proof of card and debt for over a year. This account and XXXX other XXXX XXXX accounts continue to be sold to the next collection agency and my name and info go right along with an account number that has never been mine never activated or used by me. I feel that XXXX years trying to have this removed from my record and my credit FICO score repaired by the false reporting is long enough. I went from from XXXX FICO to a XXXX overnight when XXXX XXXX Closed my XXXX XXXX and my XXXX personal credit cards which had XXXX balance at the time of closure. XXXX XXXX has never done what they have promised to do and that is repair my credit that they ruined!. 

I now ask that the XXXX credit bureaus step in and get this rectified. 

I have attached my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have attached the XXXX XXXX XXXX payments made to those cards in XX/XX/XXXX I was wrongly reported. And this now needs to be fixed. XXXX XXXX has been unable to produce my signature for the card numbers sent to collection and and they sent me to collections on something I have never opened owned activated or used. 

I would like XXXX of the XXXX XXXX accounts removed from Collections and false reporting cleaned up with each credit bureau! 

My XXXX credit cards were paid in full they have a XXXX balance. 

This is the only XXXX  XXXX  credit I have owned, activated used and paid off in full. XXXX. XXXX  XXXX  personal account is XXXX XX/XX/XXXX exp And personal card number XXXX exp XX/XX/XXXX These are my XXXX personal capital XXXX cards and once again the card numbers I owned activated and used are below The ones that were sent to collections and reported her are not accurate they are not my account numbers I have never owned activated or used them I ask that they be removed from the three credit reporting bureaus. 

When XXXX  XXXX reported me they started a snowball effect my XXXX card limit moved down to XXXX XXXX XXXX refused my payment closing the account down.

Account Information : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Account Number : XXXX Amount : XXXX I previously submitted a dispute to transunion regarding the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account. Despite providing evidence supporting the inaccuracies and requesting its removal from my credit report, Transunion failed to conduct a thorough investigation and the disputed account remains on my credit report. 

As a consumer protected under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to request the removal of inaccurate or outdated information from my credit report. Transunion failure to comply with this law is a violation of my consumer rights and has caused me financial harm and distress. 

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Transunion for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate removal of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Transunion upholds its obligations under the law.

It is appalling that a financial institution like Chime would repeatedly fail to uphold its obligations under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and Regulation E. Your institutions behavior in this matter has been nothing short of egregious, demonstrating a clear pattern of unfair and deceptive practices that will not be tolerated. 

Timeline of Dispute XXXX : XX/XX/2024 : I filed an initial dispute for unauthorized transactions totaling {$2400.00} across 92 transactions. Despite providing clear evidence that my account was compromised, Chime denied my claim in less than 24 hours. It is impossible for any reasonable investigation, let alone one involving coordination with other financial institutions and merchants, to be completed in this timeframe. 

XX/XX/2024 : I requested documentation of the supposed "" investigation. '' Chime responded by providing only my Intake Form and the evidence I submitted. There was absolutely no indication that a proper investigation, including the filing of chargebacks, had been conducted. 

XX/XX/2024 : After submitting a rebuttal, Chime once again produced the same incomplete documentation, confirming that no actual investigation was carried out. Your institutions negligence in this matter is unacceptable. 

XX/XX/2024 : After directly contacting XXXX of the merchants involved, I received a credit of {$31.00}, which Chime conveniently acknowledged separately, reducing the disputed amount to {$2400.00}. Chimes decision to isolate this transaction and revise the claim amount reeks of an attempt to downplay the severity of the issue. 

XX/XX/2024 : Chime again erroneously closed my dispute, claiming no error occurred, despite my ongoing communications with multiple merchants conducting internal fraud investigations. This demonstrates a clear disregard for the truth and a deliberate effort to avoid your responsibilities under Regulation E. 

XX/XX/2024 : I filed a second rebuttal, providing further evidence of unauthorized transactions and communication with merchants. Chimes continued refusal to address this information and coordinate with merchants as you are obligated to do, is a blatant violation of my consumer rights. 

XX/XX/2024 : Just days before the 10-business-day deadline to avoid issuing the provisional credit I am entitled to, Chime once again denied my dispute, failing to perform chargebacks or investigate properly. This is a deliberate attempt to evade your legal responsibilities. 

Additional Example of Unfair Practices : Claim ID XXXX XX/XX/2024 : I filed a separate dispute for 12 unauthorized transactions totaling {$95.00} ( Claim ID : XXXX ). As expected, Chime denied this claim without conducting any investigation or coordinating with the merchant, XXXX, which is also involved in Claim ID XXXX. However, after I reached out to XXXX directly, they confirmed fraud and issued a full refund. 

XX/XX/2024 : Chime then reversed its position on this claim, acknowledging the error and crediting my account. This pattern of initially denying disputes only to acknowledge them after I, the customer, do your job for you, is absolutely unacceptable and further illustrates Chimes unfair and deceptive practices. 

DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION : It is beyond clear that Chime has failed in its duty to protect its customers from unauthorized transactions. I am demanding that Chime : XXXX. Reopen Dispute Claim ID XXXX and properly investigate unauthorized transactions. This investigation must include the filing of chargebacks and coordination with the merchants involved. 

XXXX. Issue Provisional Credit* for the full disputed amount of {$2400.00} immediately**, as you have failed to resolve this matter within the timeframe required by law. 

XXXX. Provide a Written Explanation : detailing all actions taken, including chargebacks and communications with merchants, to resolve these disputes. 

I am filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) today, using this letter as the basis for my complaint. Your actionsor lack thereofdemonstrate a clear pattern of unfair and deceptive practices that violate consumer protection laws, including the EFTA and Regulation E. If I do not receive a satisfactory response within **5 business days** I will escalate this matter further, including filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and exploring all legal avenues available to hold Chime accountable. 

I expect a prompt and comprehensive response to this letter. Failure to address these issues will result in further action, and I will ensure that Chime 's practices are brought to the attention of the appropriate regulatory bodies.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Personal information incorrect,"I am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue with my credit report that I have been unable to resolve despite multiple attempts. My credit report contains an incorrect name and address, and there are accounts listed under this incorrect information that do not belong to me. I have only one correct name and one correct address, which I have provided above.

1. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681 The inclusion of incorrect name and address information on my credit report violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate and complete information. Under the FCRA, I have the right to dispute inaccurate information, and the credit reporting agencies are required to investigate and correct these errors within 30 days.

2. Violation of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) - Address Discrepancy Rules The incorrect information on my credit report also implicates the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ). The Act requires that any substantial discrepancies in address information be addressed and resolved by the credit reporting agencies. Failure to comply with these provisions can result in significant harm to consumers.

3. Potential Financial Compensation for Violations Under the FCRA, if the credit reporting agencies fail to correct these errors or continue to report inaccurate information, I may be entitled to monetary compensation. Specifically : Actual Damages : I may recover actual damages incurred as a result of the errors, such as increased interest rates, denied credit, or other financial losses.

Statutory Damages : In cases of willful non-compliance, I may be entitled to statutory damages ranging from {$100.00} to {$1000.00} per violation.

Punitive Damages : In cases of willful or reckless violations, the court may award punitive damages.

Attorneys Fees and Costs : The FCRA also allows for the recovery of attorneys fees and court costs if legal action becomes necessary.

4. Request for Deletion of Incorrect Accounts As a result of these violations, there are accounts associated with the incorrect name and address that do not belong to me. I am formally requesting that all accounts linked to the incorrect name and address be deleted from my credit report.

5. Previous Attempts to Resolve I have reached out to the credit reporting agenciesEquifax, XXXX, and XXXXon multiple occasions to address these errors. Unfortunately, I have not received any responses or confirmation that these issues have been addressed. The lack of response is not only frustrating but also constitutes further non-compliance with federal law.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30314,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9762566

2024-08-11,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Prior to XX/XX/XXXX, I was pursued by SOFI who endorsed : "" you will save more money if you refinance your loans through Sofi ''. Sofi encouraged me to look into their student loan calculator ( on their website ) and I began to complete research to see if Sofi would be a good refinance option for me. I entered in the information ( current federal loan borrower, interest rate, amount I owed ) and the calculator spit out a number ( that I never screenshotted for evidence, but remember ) was well over {$90000.00}. 

Prior to Sofi I was with XXXX XXXX and my loan amount was {$230000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I signed an agreement for a 15 year loan term. I updated that loan term on XX/XX/XXXX to a 20 year loan term with a 6.299 % interest rate. 

Enclosed in attachments, you will find evidence of how to utilize Sofi 's Calculator in order to see if Refinancing with them is a good option. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my attorney, XXXX XXXX, sent Sofi a demand letter asking for them to provide proof I would save money through the lifespan of my loan if I refinanced with them. 

Sofi was also asked to credit my account with the difference of what exceeds the account balance.

As you can see, in Sofi 's response, they did not address the questions being asked and provide evidence to the claims and promises stated as they pursued me They have chosen to state "" XXXX signed the loan application and approval disclosure '', which I did. They also chose to state Sofi 's calculator is offered for "" educational purposes to explore a potential loan application. '' Sofi has endorsed, in their respond letter to XXXX, "" calculated payments and savings are only estimates. '' As a potential consumer in their product, this has been misleading because in XXXX when I filled out the calculator, it was calculated that I would be saving well over {$90000.00} otherwise I would have not left XXXX XXXX. 

In the enclosed screenshot, it is stated that I will be in a deficit of over $ XXXX with a 20 year loan. 

I have relied on SoFi to act in my interests in advising me about options to address my financial situation, including helping me when I experienced financial hardship or distress select a suitable alternative repayment plan. That reliance was reasonable in part because both SoFi and the U.S. Department of Education repeatedly encouraged me to rely on their servicer to help them in this way. As described above, in numerous instances, SoFi took unreasonable advantage of my reasonable reliance on SoFi to act in their interests. SoFi did not act in my interest because it steered me to a longer loan lifespan with increased monthly payments rather than adequately advising me about income-driven repayment plans that would have been financially beneficial to me or stay with XXXX XXXX",,"SOFI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",AZ,85282,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9777731

2024-08-11,Credit card,Store credit card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"I am writing this letter to formally register a notice of dispute. It has come to my attention that frankly my securities have been stolen from your organization. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX I applied an application for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX miles, listed for {$310000.00}. The dealership knew there was no cash involved in this transaction because the vehicle was being financed as a consumer credit transaction. 15 USC 1605 clearly states that the finance charge is the sum of ALL charges. I attempted to call your organization and was met with only resistance. I know my securities were accessed because of the inquiries on my consumer reports, I am deeply concerned about the failure of consideration in our transactions. Failure of consideration is a concept which relates to the law of contracts. In contract law, a party trades something of value ( My application ) in exchange for consideration ( My truck ). The term failure of consideration implies that the consideration, which was sufficient at the time of bargaining, has ceased to be sufficient. This could happen if the consideration offered becomes worthless or miniscule compared to the value of the contract, or if the party promising to furnish the consideration fails to do so. Furthermore, the definition Congress gave adverse action in 15 USC 1681a ( k ) never mentions a denial of credit, only for insurance or employment, neither of which I applied. The Federal Reserve Act is clear. Federal Reserve Act-Any Federal Reserve bank may make application to the local Federal Reserve agent for such amount of the Federal Reserve notes hereinbefore provided for as it may require. Such application shall be accompanied with a tender to the local Federal Reserve agent of collateral in amount equal to the sum of the Federal Reserve notes thus applied for and issued pursuant to such application. The collateral security thus offered shall be notes, drafts, bills of exchange, or acceptances acquired under section 10A, 10B, 13, or 13A of this Act, or bills of exchange endorsed by a member bank of any Federal Reserve district and purchased under the provisions of section 14 of this Act, or bankers ' acceptances purchased under the provisions of said section 14, or gold certificates, or Special Drawing Right certificates, or any obligations which are direct obligations of, or are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States or any agency thereof, or assets that Federal Reserve banks may purchase or hold under section 14 of this Act or any other asset of a Federal reserve bank. In no event shall such collateral security be less than the amount of Federal Reserve notes applied for. The Federal Reserve agent shall each day notify the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of all issues and withdrawals of Federal Reserve notes to and by the Federal Reserve bank to which he is accredited. The said Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may at any time call upon a Federal Reserve bank for additional security to protect the Federal Reserve notes issued to it. Collateral shall not be required for Federal Reserve notes which are held in the vaults of, or are otherwise held by or on behalf of, Federal Reserve banks. Legal tender- Legal Tender also includes Federal Reserve notes as well as notes from Federal Reserve Banks and national banking associations for purposes of settling public and private debts, duties, dues, and taxes. Legal tender generally does not include personal checks, credit cards, or other general forms of noncash payments., the specific act of tendering the payment absolves the debt. '' The Bill of Exchange Act clearly says that the way to properly perform your bills are with interest. I know its not a common low people know, however I do. I have put in my application and attached my tender of payment with specific instructions for {$310000.00} plus any additional cost for warranties, insurance and delivery which is more than {$1.00}. 15 USC 1615. I have already stated that I am creditworthy. I understand that my current consumer report has some inaccurate and fraudulent accounts, however, I am rectifying all of my accounts and holding everyone accountable. I have read The Federal Reserve Act multiple times, but I have not come across the passage that calls a XXXX score into a consumer credit transaction, but I did read where congress calls consumer reporting agencies elaborate mechanisms. I understand that in a consumer credit transaction, I am extending my credit to you, and its discrimination to deny me access to something I applied for in good faith. I know that each consumer has an open ended credit plan, which is another reason I know I should be approved in this situation. I will preform all of my accounts, including this one, monthly for as long as the contract stays active. One of my inalienable right is the right to choose. I choose the best option for me and my family, and no one gets to take that away. This is my version of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. I dont want any special treatment, just what already belongs to me. My original instructions stated to have my XXXX delivered no later than Monday XX/XX/XXXX. You are already in breach of the contract. I will be filing a case with the SEC, CFPB, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and FTC reports for every unauthorized use of my card. The CEO and CFO of your company and anyone else I feel needs to hear about this humongous error. I will be pursuing Section 29 of the Federal Reserve Act until I receive remedy. Civil Money Penalty ( d ) Maximum Amounts Of Penalties For Any Violation Described In Subsection ( c ). The maximum daily amount of any civil penalty which may be assessed pursuant to subsection ( c ) for any violation, practice, or breach described in such subsection is -- in the case of any person other than a member bank, an amount to not exceed {>= $1,000,000} ; and in the case of a member bank, an amount not to exceed the lesser of -- {>= $1,000,000} ; or 1 percent of the total assets of such member bank. 

such section ) and any such assessment shall be subject to the provisions of such section. Since I have applied my credit to this transaction on XX/XX/XXXX I have been deceived, lied to, mentally abused and discriminated against. My tender had specific instructions to have the automobile delivered no later than XX/XX/XXXX. Its now XX/XX/XXXX and no resolve has been made. It has now been 10 days since my application which has your total at XXXX XXXX dollars and counting. Not to mention the thousands you will have to pay in arbitration, and all my court fees on the back end. All I want is what is owed to the principal, a clean XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX keys and a full tank of premium gas or {$100000.00} in revolving credit. I have cited the law for you, and will remind you again that as a corporation, willful non compliance comes with many fines as well as possible prison time. 15 USC 1681n. I dont want to take this to arbitration or make this a lawsuit, but if my rights are going to continue to be violated I will. I have done my due diligence and now its time for you to do yours. Again all I want is what is owed to the principal, which is my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX delivered to me with two ( 2 ) working keys and a full tank of premium gas as requested or {$100000.00} in revolving credit. I would like this matter handled yesterday, however from Monday XX/XX/XXXX, you have 5 days, Friday XX/XX/XXXX to have my property delivered or I will be forced to take my next steps. I trust that you will treat this matter with the gravity it deserves and that you will collaborate with me to resolve this issues promptly. Your full cooperation in this regard is crucial to ensure that we can restore the integrity of business as a whole. I expect your immediate attention to this matter.

I believe Capital Ones reluctant inaction has directly contributed to the severe impact on my credit report an significant monetary lost. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed multiple charges from XXXX  XXXX XXXX  on my Capital One credit card. I provided substantial evidence to support my claim that XXXX XXXX XXXX  engaged in fraudulent and deceptive business practices for each of the charges. I have since then mailed, emailed, called & fax Capitol Ones dispute team on countless occasions to seek assistance/ resolution in finding out what checks were made for the investigations into my claims and what feedbacks where provided by the merchant to have a dialogue to resolve the issues ; However Capitol One is reluctant to do any investigation because they seem to be concerned about the small cost they would bear for the investigations, instead of honor their obligations to protect the consumers from such fraudulent practices. 

The respective charges are {$130.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$290.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$290.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$84.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$490.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$440.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$130.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Additionally I have reported difficulties contacting XXXX XXXX XXXX to resolve issues with Software, refunds, or general inquiries to Capitol One. This pattern of behavior suggests a deliberate attempt to avoid accountability and Keep my Money without justification. 

Other customers have complained of the exact same issue by XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I have shown my evidence along with these complains ; clearly outlined how the merchant manipulated its software to prematurely terminate services, forcing myself to repurchase their services. Additionally The merchant falsely advertised itself as a platform that allowed customers to become "" XXXX XXXX '' by sharing in trading profits, on the contrary, XXXX XXXX XXXX actively manipulated the trading platform to minimize customer profits and increase customer losses through various deceptive tactics. These actions resulted in me losing significantly more money, damaging my credit and massive XXXX  ramifications on my XXXX. 

Despite providing compelling evidence, Capital One has failed to conduct a investigation into my claims. Their lack of action has allowed XXXX XXXX XXXX to continue to rob consumers of their hard-working money. This inaction is not only a significant violation of my consumer rights but also contributes to the ongoing fraudulent charges of XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate Capital One 's handling of my dispute and take appropriate action to hold them accountable for their failure to protect consumers from such predator actions.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,MD,21207,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9777494

Complaint number XXXX It all started on XX/XX/XXXX when I called Wells fargo to dispute a charge for an item I never received. They told me the fraud dept would be calling me to ask me a few more questions. About 3hours later I received a text stating Wells fargo bank did you attempt a XXXX  transaction for {$3500.00} reply yes or no. I replied no so a got another text stating Wells Fargo Fraud dept due to the NO response A representative will be contacting you shortly. About 1hr 15min later I get a face time call from a number that is labeled XXXX he told me there were 4 pending {$3500.00} XXXX  payments to a XXXX XXXX XXXX I told him no and he said the only way to stop the pending XXXX  payments I would have to transfer money from my wells fargo bank account to XXXX and the to cancel the pending XXXX  payments. There were 8 transactions 4 online and 4 XXXX  payments. He then asked me to contact my sons to finish the process. He got about {$12000.00} from 4 of my accounts. I kept telling him this did not seem right that the money was getting pulled out of my bank account and he said that was normal because all the payments were still pending and it would be back in my account tomorrow. At the end of the call he made a comment about no need to contact them back today that there was nothing more I could do about it until tomorrow and he will call me no need to call them and when they got ahold of me tomorrow the money would be back in my acct tomorrow I told them I work all day and I am not waiting for them to get ahold of me to get my money back. The whole thing felt weird but the end of the call really felt weird. So I called wells fargo less than 5 minutes after hanging up with the scammer and was on the phone with Wells fargo for 3hrs trying to stop all the payments. WF said I called them in time that all the charges were still pending and the should be able to stop them. WF said it should take a week to hear something and get money back. I got a letter from WF stating the case was closed that I authorized payments. So I called WF and asked them how they could close a dispute without looking into it. They said it was escalated to the next level and they were still working on it and I should hear something in about a month. The scammer tried breaking into my XXXX  acct, my XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. I am still getting text messages from them acting like Wells Fargo fraud dept. I filed a police report yesterday XX/XX/XXXX which was pointless but I felt necessary. I called Wellsfargo again on XX/XX/XXXX and they said my dispute was never reopened or escalated and it was not their problem because the scammer told me what to do and I did it. Please help. This is our lifesavings and the only way we can afford to pay our mortgage. If you cant help me please let me know who can. I will do or try whatever it takes to get our money back. This has turned our whole world upside down that was all the savings we had. I am now working 60 plus hours to make up some of the money we lost.

Then a week later I called back and they said they have no record of me talking to anyone and the claim was denied. I told them to find the recording of the phone call. They said there was no need that it was my fault for the missing money because I let the scammer into my account. The whole thing seemed weird and they knew this scam was going on and did NOTHING to help in anyway. I felt like they were in on it.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am filing a complaint against Capital One Bank USA Na, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX for inaccurate reporting of a charged-off debt, violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). 


Capital One Bank USA Na has reported a charged-off debt to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than 180 days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, Capital One Bank USA Na has failed to provide me with a 1099-C form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

Capital One Bank USA Na has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability. 

Capital One Bank USA Na actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, Capital One Bank USA Na is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ). 

Furthermore, Capital One Bank USA Na has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. Capital One Bank USA Na improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX without my permission. 

Additionally, Capital One Bank USA Na has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ). 

Supporting Documentation : Credit Reports to Show Lack of Unison and Accurate Reporting Opt Out Letter to Capital One Bank USA Na that was ignored FDCPA Documentation concerning charge-off statuses Requested Relief : I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Capital One Bank USA Na , XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX.

I am done playing games and sick of being harmed. As soon as I seen JPMC was the bank that was behind the Amazon card I made sure I took screenshots because i predicted this would happen. I was buying a new phone and accessories in which i was going to get I believe it was like 40 % of my full purchase. Of course, JPMC sends me an identity theft report claiming thats why it was denied and not approved. Knowing, that I have already had to issue a default to JPMC for a reason similar and not providing me requested documentation which was abiding by the law. I am writing this regarding that Amazon credit card application which in my belief was an strategic action, thinking they can have an argument after denying me ( and yes, denied, i was not approved and I am attaching harm caused ) if they send me an Identity theft protection notice, reference number on the identity theft notice ( XXXX ). Knowing they had no reason what so ever to think identity theft. I have much more evidence in my XXXX arbitration claim that just strengthens my claim and this because of all the wrongdoing they keep doing and how it adds up there is no denying it. So, that application I submitted electronically on or around XX/XX/2024, which has been denied, trying to be masked by that Identity theft notice. From my application which was not approved, and me continuously being harmed, I am requesting the immediate return of any deposits or securities related to this application. 
As no specific information was provided regarding the amount of the deposit or the terms for its return at the time of the denial, I hereby request a full accounting and prompt refund of all such funds. This request is made pursuant to applicable laws, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( 15 USC 1693 et seq. ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 USC 1601 et seq. ), which govern such transactions. 
Please provide a detailed statement showing the total amount to be refunded, including any interest accrued. This will ensure the refund is complete and accurate. I expect this matter to be resolved promptly and request that the funds be returned within 10 business upon receipt of this complaint. 
Should there be any delay in processing this refund, I will take the legal actions that is needed. I will mention this at my arbitration preliminary hearing. Giving them notice of this issue as it will be an exhibit regardless. But, I am requesting for the immediate return of any deposit or securities held in relation to this application. Failure to address this request within the 10 days will compel me to make another claim to retrieve my funds. Even though I am beyond stressed and frustrated and sick of being violated.

My partner reiterates that she is XXXX XXXX positive that she entered the right account and routing number ; the same account and routing number that she used to successfully receive the {$1.00} transaction on XX/XX/XXXX. After some time on the phone, they tell us that they can see that she entered the exact same account number and routing number for both of the transactions when she accepted the money transfer from me. The person on the phone says they will start a claim and at this point, we are given a XXXX trace #. The supervisor states that something is suspicious here and that this is not normal. We are told that it would take up to XXXX business days for a response and action to take place. On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife calls XXXX to check up and she is told that they are still investigating. The representative double checks the contact information and the best time of day to reach her once any updates/results are found. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX. It has been now XXXX  days and my partner has not received a single communication from XXXX. The {$4900.00} is not in my partner 's XXXX account nor has it been returned to my SOFI account. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, she calls XXXX again and they say that they can not do anything and that the funds are "" lost ''. 

After this, I decide to call SOFI. I speak to an account XXXX who tells me that they can not do anything because the money is out of their hands.

I C System Inc has reported a charged-off debt to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than XXXX  days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, I C System Inc has failed to provide me with a 1099-C form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

I C System Inc has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability. 

I C System Inc actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, I C System Inc is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ). 

Furthermore, I C System Inc has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to XXXX of XXXX statutory exceptions. I C System Inc improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX without my permission. 

Additionally, I C System Inc has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated XXXX  parties ) and XXXX ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ). 

Supporting Documentation : Credit Reports to Show Lack of Unison and Accurate Reporting Opt Out Letter to I C System Inc that was ignored FDCPA Documentation concerning charge-off statuses Requested Relief : I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action against I C System Inc XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX.

Despite the full payment being made on time, Capital One assessed a late fee and interest charges.

2024-08-11,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Fraud or scam,,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by phone by individuals claiming to be Wells Fargo Bank employees with granular knowledge about my checking account. I was informed by said individuals that a {$XXXX} charge was attempting to be processed from my checking account. I tried to check my mobile banking application and could not log in, trying multiple times with my login information. I was told that was because of the attempt to withdraw funds from my account. I hung up and immediately called Wells Fargo to inform them that suspicious activity was going on, and to not authorize any transactions out of my accounts. Nonetheless, the {$XXXX} transaction was fraudulently approved by my bank that night, after I notified them in real time, as a result of my online banking account being compromised. Rather than stopping the fraudulent transaction, the bank honored it despite the suspicious nature of the charge and closed the claim without contacting me. I was told that I would receive resolution on my case number that I was given while on the phone with a Wells Fargo representative the night of the XXXX. Also, on the night of XX/XX/XXXX, I issued a fraud alert on XXXX and XXXX credit reporting agencies and requested that my credit file be locked, and to notify me of any further attempts to open accounts or move funds. On XX/XX/XXXX, the transaction was posted in my checking account transaction history as authorized on XX/XX/XXXX with the bank transaction number and last XXXX digits of my debit card number. In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, and received by me on XX/XX/XXXX, claim # XXXX, I was informed that the transaction was "" authorized or that a processing error did not occur. Please consider your claim closed. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed an FBI report for wire fraud. The same day, I called Wells Fargo bank to dispute the resolution of my claim and to try to obtain more information. As none was forthcoming, I asked them to reopen my claim and elevated the dispute with Wells Fargo 's Line of Business Executive Office for further review. I spoke with another representative at that point and was told that they would attempt to reopen the claim. I informed them that I expected to hear from them within XXXX hours. During this conversation with the elevated service representative, he said that they received authorization for the fraudulent transaction. I informed them that I did not receive any request for authorization via text, phone call, or email and I did not authorize any transactions. It would be apparent from my account history that I do not have, and would not make, large transactions of this nature and it is inconceivable that I did not receive a phone call or further attempts from Wells Fargo Bank to verify this suspicious transaction. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX simply stating that they would respond within 10 days, providing me with a new claim number XXXX. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from a Wells Fargo XXXX representative in response to the XXXX hour deadline I had demanded from them on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told only that they would continue to investigate and that once a transaction is processed, they can not undo it. I again reiterated that I did not authorize this transaction. She did not provide me with any further information despite my continued request for more information about why this happened in light of my notification in real time to prevent the fraudulent transaction from posting. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo bank with the new phone number and case number contained in the email I received on XX/XX/XXXX, mentioned above. Again, I requested more information and repeated that I had not authorized this fraudulent transaction, and had notified Wells Fargo immediately that fraud was being attempted. My own investigation in the pursuit of more information as to what courses of action to take indicates that my checking account was compromised via my debit card in my XXXX XXXX. The night of the fraudulent transaction, I removed my debit card from my XXXXXXXX XXXX while on the phone with Wells Fargo, as I was suspicious that was how my account was compromised. The Wells Fargo employee deflected to XXXX. When initially asked about the status of my case number and if there was any further information including a person to speak to on a direct phone line, he initially stated that the case was still pending assignment. Later, when pushed about the lack of action on the behalf of the bank, he suddenly stated that it had been assigned to another representative, whose full name he did not disclose with an extension number. This new representative would not be able to speak with me until at least Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. This is 6 days after receiving the email from their Line of XXXX XXXX XXXX that the issue would be looked into, starting the clock again on the 10 day time frame and delaying further action by me. The Wells Fargo employee kept arguing that the transaction was authorized, despite my continuing assertion backed up by factual evidence that it was not, and that their only course of action can begin after the fraudulent transaction goes through. The transaction was fraudulently authorized XX/XX/XXXX by Wells Fargo Bank despite the fact that I was on the phone with a Wells Fargo representative alerting them to fraudulent activity in real time. This makes it impossible for them to assert that this transaction was authorized by me, as I was on a recorded line the entire night asking them to stop the transaction, freeze my accounts, and send me a new debit card. I was told again to wait to hear from their XXXX during this call on XX/XX/XXXX. 

This transaction eliminated my entire life savings. This negligence and delay tactics on the part of Wells Fargo Bank have cost me considerable time, resources, and money in addition to the fraudulent {$XXXX} money transfer to persons unknown to me. I have contacted my state and local representatives, as well as filing a complaint with the Missouri Attorney General 's office, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which regulates Wells Fargo Bank.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MO,63116,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9777134

NCB Management Services , Inc. ( NCB ) has reported a charged-off debt to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than 180 days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, NCB Management Services , Inc. ( NCB ) has failed to provide me with a 1099-C form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

NCB Management Services , Inc. ( NCB ) has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability.

NCB Management Services , Inc. ( NCB ) actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, NCB Management Services , Inc. ( NCB ) is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ).

Furthermore, NCB Management Services , Inc. ( NCB ) has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to XXXX of XXXX statutory exceptions. NCB Management Services , Inc. ( NCB ) improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX without my permission. 

Additionally, NCB Management Services , Inc. ( NCB ) has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

Their actions have violated my rights under several federal and state consumer protection laws. 

Details of the Issue : XXXX. Unlicensed Debt Collection : PRA is not licensed to collect debt in the state of Wisconsin. According to Wisconsin state law, any entity engaged in debt collection must be licensed by the XX/XX/XXXXDepartment of Financial Institutions. PRA 's failure to obtain this license renders their collection efforts illegal under the Wisconsin Consumer Act ( Wis. Stat. 421.301 ( 9 ) and Wis. Stat. 427.104 ). 

XXXX. Violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1692 : PRA has engaged in practices that violate the FDCPA, including : 15 U.S.C. 1692e : Making false or misleading representations regarding their legal right to collect the debt.

15 U.S.C. 1692f : Using unfair practices by attempting to collect a debt without proper licensing.

15 U.S.C. 1692g : Failing to provide proper validation of the debt upon request. 

XXXX. Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681 : PRA has provided inaccurate information to credit reporting agencies, damaging my credit report. They failed to : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) : Ensure the accuracy of the information reported.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : Investigate and correct inaccuracies after I disputed the debt.

4. Violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 U.S.C. 5531 : PRAs actions constitute unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices ( UDAAPs ), violating the CFPA. The CFPBs prior actions against PRA, including significant penalties for similar practices, underscore their continued non-compliance with the law.

5. Violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ) - 47 U.S.C. 227 : If PRA has used automated calls to contact me, they may also be in violation of the TCPA, which restricts the use of automated dialing systems and prerecorded messages.

I request that the CFPB take immediate action to investigate PRA 's illegal collection practices and enforce the necessary penalties.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,WI,53143,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9777158

have not supplied proof under the doctrine of estoppel by silence, Engelhardt v Gravens ( Mo ) 281 SW 715 719. I may presume that no proof of the alleged debt, nor therefore any such debt in fact exists. 

XXXX. **Debt Collection and Validation Failure** Midland Credit Management has reported accounts on my credit reports without providing me with the necessary validation of the debt, as required by 15 U.S. Code 1692g. Specifically, I did not receive a notice of debt collection or validation of the debt. This failure to provide required documentation violates my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which mandates that debt collectors must send a written notice within five days of their initial contact.

2. **Arbitration Clause and Legal Proceedings** The account in question was originally held with WebBank/Fingerhut and has since been transferred to Midland Credit Management. As per the legal precedent set in XXXX XXXX Midland Credit Management XXXX XXXX ( No. XXXX - Document XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) ), Midland Credit Management holds the right, title, and interest to these accounts, including the right to enforce arbitration clauses. The arbitration clause, as outlined in their agreements, mandates binding arbitration for disputes. 

Despite this, Midland Credit Management is pursuing legal action against me in a civil court in XXXX. This is contrary to the arbitration clause stipulated in their agreements, which is meant to resolve disputes through arbitration rather than court proceedings. 

XXXX. **Consumer Rights and Arbitration Clauses** According to Midland Credit Managements arbitration clause : - Any dispute or claim related to the account must be resolved through binding arbitration rather than court proceedings. - The arbitration clause is designed to replace the right to a jury trial and restricts the resolution of disputes to individual cases rather than class actions. 

It appears that Midland Credit Management has not adhered to this arbitration provision, which significantly affects my legal rights. 

XXXX. *XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX* Under the principle of "" volenti non fit injuria, '' which means "" to one who is willing, no harm is done, '' I do not owe this debt, as I have not been provided with proper validation. Additionally, the pursuit of legal action in court contradicts the binding arbitration agreement that governs this account. 

In light of the above, I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate these issues and take appropriate action to ensure that Midland Credit Management complies with federal debt collection regulations and their own arbitration provisions. I also request that the CFPB assist in addressing the inaccuracies on my credit report resulting from Midland Credit Managements actions. 

Enclosed with this letter are copies of relevant documents, including my credit report showing the disputed accounts and any correspondence related to the debt collection efforts. Please let me know if additional information or documentation is required. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in resolving these issues.

er 15 U.S. Code 1692, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) aims to protect consumers from abusive debt collection practices, which can include invasions of privacy and actions that compromise an individual 's capacity to contract. The law acknowledges that abusive practices contribute to personal bankruptcies, marital instability, and job loss, thereby highlighting the need to safeguard consumer privacy and competence in contractual matters. When a creditor or debt collector communicates through consumer reports without consent, it can be considered an invasion of privacy. The FDCPA restricts debt collectors from using any false, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with debt collection, which includes unauthorized use of consumer reports. By asserting your rights under this law, you can demand that such communications cease and that any damaging information be removed from your consumer report, thereby protecting your right to privacy and ensuring your competency to contract is not compromised.",,CL Holdings LLC,CA,93313,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9777150

I am sure you know that a printout of a bill or itemized document does not constitute verification according to FTC opinion letter from Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have attached the documents that were sent in response to my request. 
I require compliance with the terms and conditions of this letter within 30 days of your receipt, or a complete removal from my credit profile, in writing, of your claim.

After thoroughly reviewing 15 U.S.C. 1692g, I noticed multiple violations. As stipulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), any information reported to credit bureaus must be accurate, complete, and verifiable. And according to 15 USC 1681b, this company has not provided sufficient evidence demonstrating that there is a permissible purpose for the reporting of this debt according to my facts. 

I am requesting that you thoroughly reinvestigate this. Make sure that all relevant documents and information supporting the validity of this debt are available for examination in a timely manner. Specifically, I ask for verification of the original creditor, the amount owed, and any applicable contracts or agreements such as the debt agreement. Please also provide proof that this company is able to collect this debt on behalf of the original creditor or any other subsequent purchasers. 
I require compliance with the terms and conditions of this letter within 30 days of your receipt. If you can not comply, I demand a complete removal of your claim from my credit profile in writing. In the event of noncompliance, I reserve the right to file charges and/or complaints with the FTC, attorney general, and appropriate county, state, and federal authorities. I also reserve the right to take private civil action against this company to recover damages. 

Stop all collection efforts, including communications such as phone calls, texts, automated messages and reporting to credit reporting agencies and/ or third parties until this request is fulfilled. Reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus is fraud. 

This notice serves as my final attempt to urge your compliance with the laws under the FDCPA and FCRA. If deemed necessary, I will seek legal advice, which may result in federal or small claims court action to seek damages against your company for violations, including defamation and false claims.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,MS,390XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9777536

2024-08-11,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the application process,"XX/XX/XXXX RE : Formal Compliant Against Lakeview Mortgage Company NMLS ID XXXX To Whom It May Concern : This is a formal compliant against Lakeview Mortgage Servicer regarding an uncompleted loan assumption request. The mortgage company has been unresponsive since XX/XX/XXXX after numerous attempts to receive an answer this issue is unresolved. Their inability to complete the requested loan assumption has negatively impacted my ex-husband and his ability to borrow due to the liability still reporting on his credit. 

The situation : My Ex-Husband and myself owned our marital home jointly located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, OK XXXX utilizing a VA loan which is serviced by Lakeview Mortgage. Upon the divorce settlement and then an additional incidental real estate settlement agreement that superseded the divorce decree, I was awarded the home and the mortgage associated with the property. According to our incidental property settlement agreement, I am required to assume the mortgage for the property. My ex-husband and myself completed the required paperwork and submitted it to the mortgage company on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, we were told it would take 180 days from XX/XX/XXXX. Since this time the mortgage servicer has refused to accept our documentation to complete the loan assumption. The mortgage servicer has requested we amend our divorce decree which is not legally possible in the state of Oklahoma. What is legal in Oklahoma is completing an incidental property settlement agreement, of which we did and submitted to the mortgage servicer. However, they are refusing to accept the documentation even though the VA Underwriting guidelines state it is acceptable form of documentation of mortgage loan assumptions. The mortgage servicer has recommended I refinance the home at a cost and a much higher interest rate, which I see the mortgage servicer would profit from a refinance at a much higher rate than the current loan I have. My ex-husband and myself are both in agreement and would like this to be completed. Unfortunately, the mortgage servicer is refusing to comply and complete the loan assumption. I have called multiple times of which a several week period in XXXX of XXXX when the mortgage servicer didnt answer the phone. After trying several weeks in a row I finally was able to speak with someone who said their phone lines had been down. The representative also explained that I am unable to speak with someone over the phone regarding the assumption that I may only email. Unfortunately, this Lakeview mortgage servicer just opted to stop responding to me by email. Since I can not speak with someone via phone or email, filing a compliant with the CFPB is my last resort at attempting to comply with my ex-husband and myselfs legally binding agreement for me to assume this mortgage. Everything has been executed except for the compliance of the mortgage servicer with the legally binding contract. 

My ex-husband moved to Georgia in XXXX of XXXX to care for his terminally ill mother which is why I agreed to take the house post our divorce, leading us to draft the incidental property settlement agreement. My ex-husband has since purchased a home in Georgia where he resides today. I am the sole legal owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, OK XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX ( per the deed attached ). The only piece of business left unfinished from our divorce is this mortgage loan assumption. Again, this negatively impacts XXXX XXXX XXXX and his ability to borrower when this servicer refuses to remove this liability from his credit report. I am solely liable for this debt. XXXX XXXX XXXX and Myself would greatly appreciate if the mortgage servicer would do its job and complete the loan assumption request. We are very much looking forward to a resolution and quickly as taking 1 year and 4 months to complete this is ridiculous. 

Kind Regards, XXXX XXXX Under VA underwriting guidelines, I have the right to assume the mortgage removing the loan and liability from my ex-husband. The acceptable documentation to complete the loan assumption is outlined in the VA underwriting guidelines utilizing the last bullet point. A transfer resulting from a decree to dissolve a marriage, legal separation agreement, OR from a incidental property settlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower becomes the sole owner of the property.

15 U.S. Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information to Consumer Reporting Agencies ( a ) Duty of Furnishers of Information to Provide Accurate Information Prohibition ( A ) Reporting Information with Actual Knowledge of Errors As per 15 U.S.C. 1681s2, you are prohibited by law from furnishing any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if you know or have reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 
The IRS defines a charge-off as gross or ordinary income, which is not to be reported on a consumer report. This makes your reporting of this account inaccurate. The IRS clearly states that canceled debt or charge-offs are considered income. Therefore, reporting this account as a debt is inaccurate and a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681s2, which states that as a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency, you are legally obligated to provide accurate information. 
You are hereby notified that you are furnishing incorrect and inaccurate information. 
IRS Requirement for Form 1099-C The IRS requires that a lender file Form 1099-C and send a copy to the borrower if the amount of debt canceled is {$600.00} or more, and the lender is a financial institution, credit union, federal government agency, or other applicable entity. As you have filed this account as a canceled debt, I demand that you send me my Form 1099-C, as required by law.

In conclusion, you have been put on notice that you are reporting inaccurate information. The information you have reported is, in fact, inaccurate. 
The continued reporting of this inaccurate information is a clear violation of 15 U.S.C.

2024-08-11,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Delays with the closing process,"I called Veterans United in XX/XX/year> to discuss prequalification and the necessary steps to pursue buying a home. I discussed my case with a loan officer who determined that I initially qualified for a VA loan lower than I wanted for a home and discussed how to increase what I am eligible for. In XX/XX/year>, I contacted them again and with my partner 's income included received preapproval for a VA loan up to $ XXXX. I understand that my partner is a travel nurse and has a very complex case for loan inclusion. I proactively reached out and clarified exactly what was needed from us and Veterans United prior to us looking for homes. 

We found a house and our offer was accepted on XX/XX/XXXX with a closing date set for XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX weeks out. We notified Veterans United who began their process for loan approval. We were very responsive and provided all requested information same or next day throughout the approval process. They conducted an incredibly and frustratingly thorough approval process where we provided XXXX line items and XXXX different documents worth of information, most of which triggered further questions that required further revision and additional documents. While I understand the need for additional information and thoroughness to submit for a VA loan with a non-veteran additional person on the loan, they did not request the needed information in a timely manner and instead nearly every other night they would request XXXX to XXXX additional items of clarification that would then trigger them to request more in the next few days. 
They were so focused on completing the VA loan correctly that they did not concern themselves with the timeline or submit it for VA approval by XX/XX/XXXX, and did not notify me of the delay. They fixated on the loan details, dragged out the process, and ignored what effects this would have on me as a buyer. In essence, they were unable to do their job as a lender who had issued preapproval for a loan. 

I contacted Veterans United on XX/XX/XXXX to verify that we were approved for the loan and clear to close on the scheduled closing date of XX/XX/XXXX, and was told that despite us providing all of this information and doing it so responsively, they still needed more information before they could submit to the VA for approval which would take up to XXXX additional days. I had to reach out to them to find out that they needed at least until the end of the month to finish loan approval, and could not give me a specific date to change closing to. The job of a lender is to work with the buyer to achieve loan approval within the agreed timeframe, and to notify all parties to any changes or delays. They not only extended out their data gathering for over XXXX weeks, they did not inform me that they were not going to meet closing until I contacted them. I now have to pay to extend my current lease, provide additional funds requested by the sellers due to delay of closing, risk losing the home and earnest money that I paid, and go through the emotional and personal hardship that this has caused. They never got to the point where they submitted the file for VA approval. 

I'm a reasonable person and truly was diligent about providing all information needed when needed and followed up with them to ensure everything was set for the closing date. I even called and asked XXXX weeks prior to closing if we could bypass some requirements by decreasing my XXXX or other ideas to make the process more hassle free. I was told that the VA loan was the best way to go, no changes were needed by us, and we were nearly done with the process. I was misled, and after paying them to do the appraisal for the home, inspections and additions they said were required by the VA, and now additional costs of delay, I feel like I was paying money into a process that had no intention of getting me a loan. I called their escalation team and explained the situation. I was told that I was far enough along that the only thing they could do was to talk to my loan coordinator and officer about the lack of communication that caused the unexpected shock of not meeting the closing day. I had already discussed this with them and with no other recourse available to address these concerns, am now entering this complaint. 

I went with Veterans United instead of other lenders because of what I thought was their understanding of the VA loan. They do not understand how to coordinate VA loan requirements, by exceeding the closing date and not notifying myself or realtor risked both my earnest money amount and me losing the home, and with an extension now accrued extra costs to me.

You { XXXX, XXXX, XXXX } reported an alleged transaction as Late. 15 U.S. Code 1666b - Timing of payments ( a ) TIME TO MAKE PAYMENTS A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 15 USC 1681e ( b ) ( b ) ACCURACY OF REPORT Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. I requested the information that you must have or possess by law in order for you to report a payment as late. This is being request pursuant rule 1002. In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the conditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met. You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late and the evidence that must be sent to you to prove that this transaction was late. It has been over 30 days and you have not properly verify the information. Id. at 1303 ; see also Blacks Law Dictionary ( 11th ed. 2019 ) ( defining verify as [ t ] o prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate ). 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) REINVESTIGATIONS OF DISPUTED INFORMATION ( 1 ) REINVESTIGATION REQUIRED ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified. Hinkle, 827 F.3d at 1304. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account. I am requesting pursuant 15 USC 1681i ( 6 ) NOTICE OF RESULTS OF REINVESTIGATION ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by the consumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to the consumer by the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher. when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information. In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information. That provision thus contemplates that when information can no longer be verified, the proper response is to delet [ e ] it.

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX are in violation of The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. FERPA, also known as the Buckley Amendment, is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Key points of the law include : Ownership of Records : Students own their education records and have the right to inspect and review them. 
Consent for Disclosure : Schools generally can not disclose personally identifiable information ( PII ) from student records without written consent. it prohibits educational institutions from disclosing personally identifiable information in education records without the written consent of the student, or, if the student is a minor, the student 's parents. ( 20 U.S.C.S. 1232g ( b ) ) .Schools may disclose, without consent, "" directory '' information such as a student 's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. Transaction history is prohibited under this law, which covers the amount of the educational loan and payment methods or deferment. Their actions constitute unauthorized and illegal reporting of my educational records, specifically the transaction history, to consumer reporting agencies. This action by DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET is a clear violation of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) of 1974. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) safeguards educational records, encompassing a wide array of information, including but not limited to grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, and personally identifiable information ( PII ) directly linked to a student. Transaction history pertinent to educational loans or financial matters, although not explicitly outlined in FERPA, falls squarely within the realm of protected information due to its direct association with the educational journey and financial status of the student. As custodians of these records, DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET is bound by FERPA regulations. However, they have egregiously disregarded these regulations by reporting transaction histories to consumer reporting agencies without obtaining my explicit consent, thereby breaching the privacy rights guaranteed under FERPA. Moreover, the Privacy Act of 1974 supplements FERPA by regulating the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by federal agencies. This act establishes stringent measures to ensure confidentiality, accuracy, relevance, and proper use of personal information. DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET disclosure of my transaction history to consumer reporting agencies without my explicit consent constitutes a blatant violation not only of FERPA but also of the broader principles established under the Privacy Act of 1974. These actions compromise the confidentiality and privacy protections afforded to my educational records and personal information, resulting in tangible financial damages and emotional distress. Despite my attempts to rectify this matter directly with DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET , their failure to acknowledge or resolve the issue necessitates the intervention of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .

DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the transaction history of my educational affairs, DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers ( Me ).

Furthermore DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX without my permission.

Additionally, DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELNET has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

To Whom It May Concern, This letter serves as a formal notice of dispute concerning the reported late payments associated with my account XXXX with ALLIANT CREDIT UNION. This dispute is brought according to my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ), specifically under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), which requires the prompt investigation and correction of disputed information. 

My dispute is further supported by the legal precedent established in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX.

Accordingly, I hereby request that you provide the following specific documentation to substantiate your claim that the payment in question was late : Internal Records, Logs, or Notes and Interactions : Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681m ( a ), please provide all internal records, logs, or notes and interactions that indicate the exact date and time the payment was received by your institution. 

Supporting Communication or Documentation : In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which mandates the accurate reporting of information, I request any communication or documentation that supports the assertion that the payment was received after the established due date. 

Relevant Policies or Procedures : As provided by 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ), which requires furnishers of information to notify consumer reporting agencies of corrections to information that is found to be inaccurate, please supply any policies or procedures that were in place at the time, governing the handling of payments and the reporting of late payments. 

Please provide the requested documentation by XX/XX/XXXX, which falls within the legally required XXXXay period as stipulated under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

2024-08-11,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"I am unable to access the funds in my checking account. I first became aware of the problem on Monday XX/XX/XXXX when I was unable to login to my account online. I subsequently attempted to use my citicard at a Citibank atm to see my balances and got a screen advising me to call the bank. I called and was told my account had been "" referred for closure ''. They were unable to give me any information about why. I was told they would send me a letter explaining their decision and I would receive a check in the mail for any money remaining in the account. I asked to speak to a manager and was told there is no one I could speak with who could tell me anything more - I would have to wait for the letter. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I have NOT received any letter from Citibank. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX of Citibank who left a voicemail, saying he is my personal banker and asking me to call or stop by the XXXX XXXX XXXX. The following day, XX/XX/XXXX, I visited the XXXX XXXX branch. I asked for XXXX- he came and said hello and then passed me to XXXX XXXX. XXXX was unable to see any information about my accounts in the bank 's system. He called, after confirming my identity with my license and security questions, and spoke with the fraud division who told him nothing except that a letter had been sent to me explaining the situation. He informed them I had not received the letter. At my request, he asked if the letter could be emailed or faxed to me and was told no. He confirmed the address the letter was mailed to and asked them to resend it. 

I waited another week - still no letter. Still no explanation from Citibank about why this was happening. Still unable to access my account, unable to know if bill payments that I had setup online had been paid, wondering if my money was still in my account or if it had been stolen, or if had been a victim of identity theft. After bit of research on line, I filed a complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 

On XXXX, I went to my home branch, XXXX XXXX ( # XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I was first assisted by teller XXXX XXXX and then by Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX. Unlike the staff at the XXXX XXXX branch, they were able to see the activity on the accounts and the current balances so they were able to reassure me that the money was still in my account. I asked to close both my checking and savings accounts. They said the checking account was locked and could not be closed. However, there was no hold on the savings account. I closed the savings account and was given a bank check. The branch manager encouraged me to call again to see if they would explain the hold on my checking account. ( Note : unlike all of my other encounters with Citibank personnel, the branch staff delivered excellent customer service ; they were helpful and professional, expressing their regrets for the situation I found myself in and trying to reassure me that Citibank was probably acting to protect me. At the Branch Manager 's suggestion, I again called the Citibank Customer Service number while still at the branch. I spoke with XXXX, who told me there was a hold on the account but he could not see why. He gave me the number for the security division : XXXX ext XXXX. I called that number and was connected to XXXX, who told me that a decision had been made to close my account and end XXXX relationship with me. She could not tell me why but said I would receive a letter explaining the situation. I told her of the previous conversations with Citibank promising a letter but no letter had arrived. She said it could take from XXXX days. I pointed out that it had been more than 10 days since XX/XX/XXXX when the first letter had supposedly been sent. She informed me that since there was a note in the file from XX/XX/XXXX to resend the letter to the verified address '' and it had not yet been 10 days, she would not put in another request to resend the letter. I asked if the letter could be emailed or faxed to the branch and she said no. I asked her what she thought I should do if I dont receive the letter once it had been more than 10 days from XX/XX/XXXX. She said I could then call back and request that they again resend the letter. ( She did not seem to appreciate how absurd this was from my point of view. ) I asked her when I would receive the money that was in my checking account. She explained that Citibank had the right to terminate their relationship with me and they had up to 60 days to release the funds. She said I would be mailed a check for any funds remaining in my account at that time. I pointed out that it was hard for me to believe that I would be mailed a check since I had not yet received either letter that they said they had sent. She somewhat officiously repeated her script Citibank was within its rights to close my account and had XXXX days to return the funds to me and this was all in accordance with XXXX policy. 

I have had a checking account withe Citibank for more than XXXX  years. I remain unable to access the more than {$10000.00} in my account. Citibank 's only response has been to tell me to wait for a letter that has not yet come and then wait several more weeks to receive a check for the money that is in my account. I have little faith that Citibank will ever explain what they did or return my money to me.

I reported the identity theft with the Federal Trade Commission.

Barclays Bank Delaware has denied that it is fraud on the basis of the flights being booked in my name. I appealed with a letter and a copy of my FTC report.

I signed up for a 24-month, 0 % interest Home Depot consumer credit card through Citi Bank in purchasing these windows, putting {$20000.00} on the credit card. Due to high window costs, I was able to meet the promotion of 24-month, 0 % interest financing as advertised by Home Depot and qualified for the {$20000.00} balance charge on my credit card. Since the purchase, an automatic payment of {$1000.00} was set up each month to ensure the balance of {$20000.00} will be paid within less than 24 months. For the first month, {$200.00} additional payment was made as the automatic payment had not taken place right away. 

On XXXX XXXX, we noticed that there was a higher balance remaining than we anticipated, considering {$1000.00} payment had taken place each month. It turns out Citi Bank never honored this and defaulted the terms at 6 months, 0 % interest. We never agreed to 6 months, 0 % interest financing. They pulled a BAIT AND SWITCH. We called Home Depot after Citi Bank said there is nothing they can do, and the Home Depot manager did confirm the promotion and for the purchase period. The Home Depot manager tried calling Citi Bank but they told him they couldnt help because 60 days had passed. Keep in mind we originally agreed to 24 months, 0 % interest since day one and since day one, the payments have been on automatic withdraw. Home Depot manager stated he would even agree to be in a three-way call to confirm.

However, Citi Bank will NOT take any responsibility and play oh, you did not read the fine prints. We never agreed to those fine prints, we agreed to 24 months with 0 % interest and out of nowhere Citi Bank or Home Depot did a bait and switch. Problem is that Citi Bank and Home Depot will do anything to sell their business but change the contract without your consent or your knowledge. This is not only deceiving but this is fraud!

I was just put in contact with another worker with Wells Fargo and no check was done to make sure they are actually looking at the evidence provided. I sent wells Fargo and lengthy email detailing the locations of the false charges and my personal location on not only the date that the charges were placed but on several days before as well to thoroughly exclude myself from being the one who made said charges. I showed my fill location history for several days at no point going to any of those facilities but I was still somehow found to be the one going into those establishments and spending amounts of money i have one never spent before and at places i had two never been before.

I am confident that these entries are the result of a grievous error, if not outright fraud, and I am requesting their swift removal.The inquiries in question are as follows : XXXX XXXX Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX Nature of Dispute : Unauthorized Inquiry Explanation : I have never initiated or consented to any credit inquiry with XXXXXXXX XXXX or any affiliated entity on the specified date. This inquiry appears to be an erroneous or fraudulent entry that I insist be expunged from my record immediately. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX Account Number : Nature of Dispute : Unauthorized Inquiry Explanation : I have no affiliation with XXXX XXXX XXXX nor have I sought any credit or financial services from them. This unauthorized inquiry is both perplexing and unwarranted. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  Inquiry Dates : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX Nature of Dispute : Unauthorized Inquiries Explanation : I am disputing these inquiries as I did not authorize any credit applications with XXXX  XXXX on these dates. These entries are entirely spurious and must be corrected without delay.

2024-08-11,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"I opened an account with Bank of America XXXX  XXXX XXXX card on XX/XX/XXXX and received a card in the mail within a few weeks. I activated it and used it to charge {$3000.00} to cover the reward amount necessary to spend in first 90 days, by calling my timeshare company and paid my annual Maintenance Fees with the card. 

Within a few more weeks, I received a text notification that questioning whether I tried to use the card at XXXX XXXX. I explained I had not used it again since that XXXX charge not at XXXX XXXX nor anywhere else, and the card had never left my house, being safely store in a safe, only to be used on trips. 

They canceled the card immediately ( I cut it up and tossed the scraps away ) and they had a new card sent out and transferred everything about my account ( reward points, balance, history ) to the new card. I received a new card several weeks later and activated from my home phone. I then placed that card in the safe. 

Without it ever coming out of the safe, never being used anywhere- not online nor in person, not using the number or swiping the card, the same thing happened again with XXXX XXXX XXXX and I received a text asking me if the charges were mine. I spoke to BoA who said the best thing would be to speak with XXXX Fraud and they transferred me. The rep at XXXX said they have absolutely nothing to do with consumers and fraud and cant help me and that it has to be taken care with Bank of America and transferred me back. When the rep answered I asked to speak to a fraud Supervisor. He said the way they can stop it since it is only happening with XXXX XXXX is to put a stop on it Ito prevent any XXXX charges on the card since it was only happening with XXXX.. He also said that by creating a paper trail of fraud detection, it will be investigated by a higher level. THe assured me it would not happen again.I received yet another new card and activated it from my cell phone, and then put it away in the safe. You know by now I did not use it ever- not online, in person, nor over the phone! And yet, tonight I received yet another text informing me of XXXX declined charges at XXXX XXXX and XXXX at XXXX XXXX. At the post I am beyond frustrated as the Floor Supervisor I spoke to said there is nothing that they can do other that starting a fraud claim to refund the payment and that the card had already been cancelled and a new card will arrive soon. I pressed her to record in my account that she was saying she was the highest level this can go. That there is nothing else BofA can do. That she would expect it not to happen again, and if it does I should feel satisfied to know I wont be liable for fraudulent charges.I believe there could be an internal fraud happening at BofA, and that maybe there are lots of other s in a similar situation all being told not to worry. Meanwhile, who knows the information they might be accessing? Please help stop this nonsense so I can stop wasting my time and energy on this, and that I might actually be able to use the card and rewards if I ever have a card long enough for it to be useful.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",WA,98370,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,9778396

2024-08-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Other personal consumer report,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"I have had an issue with XXXX about my background check since XXXX of XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, I was charged with a crime against my abuser and an a XXXX  of XXXX  XXXX. The case was pending for XXXX Mos, during this time I lost XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX finally, was dismissed. This had happened once previously, same charge yet I lost no access though did have a background report re run and submitted to each company during the pending status. Once my case was dismissed, I filed disputes with checkr for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I obviously needed to dispute with XXXX eats as well but XXXX XXXX web site has no option to do so like it did the others. I reached out to them regarding this and notified them of changes in my report and I would need it re run and sent to XXXX eats. I noticed previously on their canidate portal that I also had an XXXX account but thought nothing of it and assumed it was related to my XXXX XXXX account. When reaching out via chat, as it is frustratingly their only communication option, I was alerted to identify theft by being asked if I was referring to my delivery or driver account. I said I do not have a driver account only delivery. They said I had a driver account which was associated with a location and an email and a phone number I did not recognize. They did not remove any of it though over the past few months I have requested many times. They don't seem concerned at all that they are incorrectly reporting or allowing identity theft. They have said they find it to be correct via email. Though, I don't even know what they are referring to when they say that and I do not think they do either. From XXXX to XXXX went by different last name and that is also the name the thief is using. Which caused XXXX to deactivate due to multiple accounts which is a violation of their terms and conditions. Even though I had reported the identity theft to them days prior. XXXX has also failed to assist in this matter and will not inform me the status of anything and continues to refer me to companies of which I have no relationship as they were created by the thief. They continue to send an automated response to contact other company. This had been incredibly frustrating as I continue to, via chat, explain myself to XXXX XXXX  and XXXX and am given the same automated responses. My income has been affected. I am being evicted and do not have anyone so I am terrified because I have kids. Both companies do not tell me of their response to identity theft or even acknowledge it has happened. I believe both companies keep no notes of correspondence. I figured fine, it is obviously computers doing all the approving. So I began requesting Checkr just re run my report and send it to XXXX eats but only XXXX eats and not XXXX as XXXX has tighter requirements and I would not be approved for an XXXX XXXX account. Also, reminding them that the XXXX rideshare account is identity theft and fraudulent and therefore not a request I even authorized. One of the many facts that are just completely jamming up their system and making my account look like total chaos and another total violation of the fcra on their part. They tell me, over many months, they will not send a report to XXXX eats because XXXX eats had not requested it and I should contact them. Contacting XXXX eats is equally as frustrating and they say to contact XXXX. I have in XXXX occasions been told by XXXX eats that there is a technical issue stopping it and it happens some times and that they are escalating to another department to have my report manually entered. Though, when I follow up about this it is as if they have no idea what I'm talking about but they do not attempt to understand. They do not aknowledge at all and tell me my deactivation sticks and to contact company that I have no relationship with regarding the fraudulent account. I of course can not a they are online only and I have no idea the numbers or emails or passwords or even city. It is interesting companies that exist to know who a person is is not able to deal with this or even understand that is an issue. The XXXX account background check obviously would be denied due to other charges I had from XXXX ish not just the recent pending charges that are now dismissed. However, applying to XXXX eats orginally in XXXX and being approved and delivering for them for 2 years, during which time many background reports were re run and sent to them without issue. Obviously, charges from XXXX where on my report at this time. It was never an issue. When the pending charges de activated all my accounts recently, though it has not previously, different county perhaps? Not sure because it was same charge only different county don't know why this time. In any event all others immediately re activated my account expect for XXXX eats. Contacting XXXX eats and them telling me to contact the companies of which I can not because it isn't mine and that account being opened during my deactivation leads me to believe it is the fraudulent account for XXXX rideshare that is messing me up. It even shows in the app that I am ready to go for XXXX eats. XXXX eats refuses to aknowledge the company they refer to had never sent me an email and that my rideshare account should be deleted completely and any background check related to it should be retracted on their end and deleted on checkrs  and other third parties end. XXXX eats has told me they submitted the request again to XXXX but that has proven to be false. Checkr continues to say they can't re run and send to XXXX eats and omit the fraudulent account. They also will not manually dispute XXXX eats, which I believe would solve this problem. XXXX, for all my gigs will not delete my statement that added to the dispute while my charge was pending. Which, for door dash and XXXX XXXX now that the charge is gone just hangs out on my report associated with and referring to absolutely nothing. Those reports are totally clear aside from my statement which now just makes me look crazy. I am beyond frustrated and suffering due to this. No one will listen or address these very serious matters.

This caused me to be sent to collections not only by XXXX but its contractors radiology associates and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, so a total of three times I was sent to collections for one XXXX  room visit that covered XXXX day. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed XXXX accounts with XXXX as they were never supposed to be sent to collections in the first place. I also never received a bill or notification by either XXXX XXXX or Wakefield and Associates, the last debt collector I am having issues with still. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I tried to contact the original creditor to set the record straight when I found out XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had gone bankrupt when my debt was sent to collections. I have no sure way of contacting XXXX and so far Wakefield and Associates have not provided proof that this is my debt or provided me current information to contact this creditor. I emailed them asking them to validate the debt and all contact information related to the original creditor. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, a XXXX XXXX  billing associate sent the insurance information I provided a second time to the XXXX  to Wakefield and Associates without my knowledge, I'm concerned that this could trash my credit for years, even though it was a medical billing error only. 

As a result of this adverse action taken on my credit report by Wakefield and Associates I've been denied a student loan.

2024-08-11,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"It feels like a massive waste of time to have to write this complaint, but without doing so, nothing will get resolved. I opened this credit card, the card was never shipped to me. I had waited for several weeks and had to call in. From the start they were going to tell me it would take another week or two to receive it. I stated very clearly that it was already their fault I did not have it, I wanted to make a large purchase with said card. I had to speak to a supervisor to get a next day card. 

Fast forward to my first statement balance. The website would not allow me to add any payment information, I tried several times. I eventually had to call the customer support line and provide this information over the phone which I was not happy about. They paid my bill over the phone and i was under the impression they signed me up for auto bill pay. I have very strong credit, I enroll in auto pay for all my credit cards, mortgage, etc. 

Fast forward to last week while I was on vacation, I saw I was past due on a payment, no email was sent to me.. I went into the payments section to explore why a payment was not sent.. all my checking account information was gone from the website. I did not modify this on my own. It was just gone.

So not only did I not receive an email reminder ( paperless billing ), but my payment information was gone so I was unable to easily make a payment from my phone. I had to find a laptop, while on vacation, just to gather all the necessary information to post a payment of the full account balance.

Fast forward to today, I had to speak to an IVR and give 5 -6 voice prompts just to speak to someone. They gave me the general statement about a 1 time XXXX $ credit for late fee, assuming I pay my next balance in full, etc. I said I want the full XXXX credited because this is bank is a comedy of errors. 

Why does paperless billing not send me an email to alert about upcoming payment? 

Why is my payment information suddenly gone? 

Why doesn't the bank look into my support interaction to see the initial trouble I had with this bank and have empathy for a customer? 

This all feels like they are setting up customers to fail and have to suffer late fees. XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  are EXTREMELY easy to work with. Comenity has a frustrating user experience.

We received a notification from all 3 credit bureaus that our Loan Depot balance increased from {$470000.00} to over {$470000.00}. I was extremely confused as there's no reason for our balance to increase while payments are paused. When I called the executive team at Loan Depot they confirmed that our balance has not increased, and our payments have simply been paused. They also confirmed that paused payments do not get added to the existing balance of the loan, they just get added to the life of the loan. She said she would inquire about how they reported it, but she said she only shows that it was reported as a forbearance, nothing more. I explained to her that all 3 credit bureaus are showing an "" increased balance '' so it is more than likely not something that the credit agencies are doing and I asked if she could check into this again because something either isnt getting reported correctly, or is being left out. Our balance is the exact same as of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). It hasn't changed or increased at all. Someone is reporting it to the credit agencies incorrectly and they are adding our paused payments as additional payments and causing a notification of an "" increased balance '' instead of reporting them as paused payments. My husband and I both took a 60+ point hit on our credit scores because of this, resulting in damaged credit. We also confirmed with Loan Depot that there is no negative reporting to our credit as it is a forbearance on a current account, and we are also under a VA moratorium until XX/XX/XXXX regardless.

We tried to get general information from them about our options and they would not provide any options or information unless we applied for Loss Mitigation, even though we were still current on our mortgage at the time. We explained that we were trying to be proactive, as to not have any late payments reported, but the representative said they can only assess options for us once we apply for the loss mitigation and that an application would only be considered IF we were delinquent. 
We applied in XXXX of 2023 when we didnt make our payment on the XXXX, and after about a month of back and forth with the company asking for additional documents, our application was officially complete on XX/XX/scrub> 2023. 
During this application period, we talked with a representative named XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX expressing our concerns about the late payments and we were assured that we would not be foreclosed on and that nothing had been reported to the credit bureaus about the late payment because we had applied for loss mitigation. 
On XX/XX/scrub> 2023, we called Flagstar because we still had not heard from them about our application. The representative XXXX let me know that they marked our application as complete and that it was in underwriting on XX/XX/scrub> 2023. We were assured once more that we were not in any threat of foreclosure but that we were reported to the credit bureaus as a 30 day late on XX/XX/scrub> 2023. 
We then received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX notifying us of pre-foreclosure. 
On XX/XX/year>2023 we called Flagstar about this notice and we spoke with representative XXXX and she assured us not to worry about it and disregard it because we were covered under the Loss Mitigation application. 
On XX/XX/scrub>, 2023, we called to get current on the mortgage payments, as we still did not have a resolution/recommendation from our Loss Mitigation application. We made the payment of {$5100.00} and were told that we were current. We then let the representative know that we did not need to proceed with the Loss Mitigation, as we decided we were going to list the home for sale and scale down with the changes in our income. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, Flagstar mailed the approval for FLEX MODIFICATION PLAN and we received the letter at the end of XX/XX/scrub> 2023.

We made one last mortgage payment on XX/XX/scrub>, 2023 and sold the home on XX/XX/year>. 
We moved out of state and my credit was hit with two 30 day lates AFTER we closed through escrow.

We are now trying to purchase our next home and can not because there are two 30 day lates and a 60 day late that is showing on our credit report.

In addition, I was the only person on this home loan with Flagstar, but they ran a hard credit inquiry on my wife ( without our knowledge ) during the loss mitigation review, significantly negatively affecting her credit.

Because of the loss mitigation representatives failure to provide accurate information to us regarding credit reporting, we are now without a home and potentially having to wait 24 full months before we can be considered for a home loan again. We both have credit scores in the mid-high XXXX even with these lates reporting.

We have applied for an internal review of the credit reporting and after their review, they denied us the deletion we requested.

We finally reached a supervisor with Flagstars credit reporting department after many lunch break phone calls and being placed on hold for 45 minutes to an hour, and he said theres nothing they can do about it, but we were welcome to submit a letter noting the dates of these conversations so they could review the calls and to also submit the letter directly to the credit bureaus.

Our late payments werent reported until a month after we sold the home, and 3 months after we got current on the mortgage. It feels like we were told very wrong information by multiple Flagstar loss mitigation representatives and are now paying the price. If they had been clear to us that they would be reporting late payments even during the loss mitigation, we would have borrowed money from family until the home sold to avoid taking hits on our credit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANCORP INC,TX,77338,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9789902

Synchrony 's newest response from this past week is telling me I need to contact Paypal directly to figure this out. Well, I DID previously contact them directly on CFPB Case Number XXXX. Paypal rejected this report without saying anything to me, and it was silently passed over to Synchrony. The past four months have been an unrelenting battle where I'm getting kicked around in every direction and I'm not getting any clear answers for my legitimate privacy concerns. Please see the attached PDF reports from XXXX XXXX XXXX for that whole horrendous paper trail. So, I'm back to my second attempt where I'm asking Paypal this question directly : WHY was my account getting locked at random hours two nights in a row? Is this something Paypal was legitimately doing as part of the identity theft case, or was this some anonymous goofball trying to hack another one of my bank accounts as a prank? The thing is : IF this is just something Paypal did manually as a precaution, I really don't mind! I would still be wondering why they chose to lock my account twice at XXXX EST in the XXXX, but at least I would know who is doing it. BUT I still need to know : Was this someone trying to hack me again?!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,PA,159XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9775075

This process with the XXXX XXXX started in XXXX of XXXX. Even with their assistance, we still had problems with Ameirsave working with us in a timely manner.

However, the agreement with XXXX  was to pay them to communicate with Amerisave and our payments would be halted until an agreement was reached with Amerisave on a modification. Finally, after back and forth communication with Amerisave over a 7 month period, Amerisave finally sent us a modification agreement. We signed the agreement and started our trial payments. However, on the last payment, I spoke with one of the loss mitigation reps to set up the payment to come out on the first of the month. The payment posted on XXXX the XXXX to our account, but Amerisave said that it post on their end on the XXXX of XXXX, which they say voided the trial plan agreement because the payment posted early.

2024-08-11,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"I am writing to file a complaint regarding a credit card application denial by American Express that I believe may involve discriminatory practices and a lack of equal consideration. 

On XX/XX/year>, I applied for the Blue Cash Everyday card from American Express. My application was denied, and I received an adverse action letter citing my XXXX score ( XXXX ) as the primary reason for the denial. 

I believe this denial may be discriminatory for the following reasons : 1. Religious Discrimination : As a XXXX, I operate with the belief of conducting business honorably and in good faith. I believe this religious principle may have been used against me in the credit decision process.

2. Lack of Equal Consideration : The adverse action letter does not provide sufficient information about how my application was evaluated beyond the XXXX score. I believe my entire financial profile and my commitment to honorable dealings were not given proper consideration. 

3. Potential Violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) : The ECOA prohibits discrimination in credit transactions based on religion, among other factors. I believe my application may not have been evaluated fairly and in compliance with this act.

4. Misleading Advertising : The credit card was advertised with certain terms, but the denial seems to contradict the implied accessibility of the product based on those advertised terms.

5. Lack of Transparency : The adverse action letter does not provide a clear explanation of how my religious beliefs and principles of honorable dealings were factored into the decision-making process. 

I request a thorough investigation into American Express 's credit application evaluation process to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws, particularly regarding religious beliefs and practices. 

Additionally, I ask for a review of American Express 's advertising practices to ensure they are not misleading consumers about the accessibility of their credit products.

2024-08-11,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"XX/XX/XXXX The basis of my complaint is that my Wells Fargo Bill Pay account was hacked when a Bill Pay category ( XXXX XXXX credit card ) was added to my Bill Pay account and {$1900.00} was taken from my account without my knowledge, consent, permission or authorization. Wells Fargo is denying my claim, does not believe my account was hacked and have concluded that after their research, theyve found that "" the transaction was made through a secure online banking session by you ( me ) or someone who had your ( my ) authority and that no other processing errors occurred ''. This is not true. I do not, nor never had a XXXX XXXX credit card. 
It is my belief that Wells Fargo has conducted an incomplete investigation with a faulty conclusion. I further assert that Wells Fargo is not considering my signed affidavit stating that the transaction did occur without my knowledge or consent and that other circumstances surrounding this incident are not being considered. The events and other circumstances will be detailed below as succinctly as I can demonstrate. In fact, in talking with several Wells Fargo representatives about their research, no one was able to tell me what device they determined had been used, what time of day the transaction occurred, whos IP address was recorded and whether in their research anyone reached out to XXXX XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, a woman by the name of XXXX who identified herself as a Case Specialist with the Executive Office Complaint Department with Wells Fargo reached out to me, where previously no one had. At this time, I provided her all the details I could about the hack, and she said there would be further consideration, and shed get back to me within 10 business days or less. XXXX reached me on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX and informed me that they would still deny my claim. I was very angry and frustrated, and she continued to assert that in their research it was still determined that the transaction was made with my consent. Of note is that this woman was completely and utterly devoid of any empathy or concern, in itself disturbing. She offered little to no assistance. 
I asked her if they had contacted XXXX XXXX during their research and her response was essentially avoidant and she directed me to either contact XXXX XXXX myself or to call the Wells Fargo Claims department myself. I also asked what my next step was in my complaint, and she was not able to help me. When I called the claims department, the recording said I had an up to thirty-minute wait, so I hung up. 
I have now contacted XXXX XXXX and with the assistance of XXXX XXXX who faxed the requested information, they are conducting some research into this incident. This Im sure will still take several weeks. 
Finally, what I believe that Wells Fargo is not taking into account is the following : That on XX/XX/XXXX and on or about XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX  credit card was hacked and my points stolen and then on XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX  XXXX XXXX account was also hacked. I informed XXXX of all of these events. 
Ive never, to my knowledge possessed any kind of account with XXXX XXXX It seems that Wells Fargo has failed to recognize that it is possible for a hacker to make it appear that a transaction came through my device I live alone and have no children or ex-wives who might have access to my account information I have not given anyone any of my banking information Why would I have called Wells Fargo as soon as I saw on my Bill Pay account the first time the XXXX XXXX account was added? 
Why would I have called Wells Fargo the 2nd time I saw the XXXX XXXX card added the second time to stop the payment? 
Why did I receive a notification that a payee was added to my Bill Pay account the second time the XXXX XXXX account was added ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and not the first time ( XX/XX/XXXX )? I may have been able to prevent the debit from going through had I been notified. 
Why would I have gone through the trouble of changing the email accounts attached to my Wells Fargo account and my other financial accounts. 
Finally, why would I have gone through the trouble of changing my username and passwords on all of my financial accounts multiple times and the username and password for my email and Ive now signed up for a more secure email account and linked my accounts to this? 
There is more but Im afraid Ive already written too much.

2024-08-11,Credit card,Store credit card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"I am writing this letter to formally register a notice of dispute. It has come to my attention that frankly my securities have been stolen from your organization. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX I applied an application for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX miles, listed for {$310000.00}. The dealership knew there was no cash involved in this transaction because the vehicle was being financed as a consumer credit transaction. 15 USC 1605 clearly states that the finance charge is the sum of ALL charges. I attempted to call your organization and was met with only resistance. I know my securities were accessed because of the inquiries on my consumer reports, I am deeply concerned about the failure of consideration in our transactions. Failure of consideration is a concept which relates to the law of contracts. In contract law, a party trades something of value ( My application ) in exchange for consideration ( My truck ). The term failure of consideration implies that the consideration, which was sufficient at the time of bargaining, has ceased to be sufficient. This could happen if the consideration offered becomes worthless or miniscule compared to the value of the contract, or if the party promising to furnish the consideration fails to do so. Furthermore, the definition Congress gave adverse action in 15 USC 1681a ( k ) never mentions a denial of credit, only for insurance or employment, neither of which I applied. The Federal Reserve Act is clear. Federal Reserve Act-Any Federal Reserve bank may make application to the local Federal Reserve agent for such amount of the Federal Reserve notes hereinbefore provided for as it may require. Such application shall be accompanied with a tender to the local Federal Reserve agent of collateral in amount equal to the sum of the Federal Reserve notes thus applied for and issued pursuant to such application. The collateral security thus offered shall be notes, drafts, bills of exchange, or acceptances acquired under section 10A, 10B, 13, or 13A of this Act, or bills of exchange endorsed by a member bank of any Federal Reserve district and purchased under the provisions of section 14 of this Act, or bankers ' acceptances purchased under the provisions of said section 14, or gold certificates, or Special Drawing Right certificates, or any obligations which are direct obligations of, or are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States or any agency thereof, or assets that Federal Reserve banks may purchase or hold under section 14 of this Act or any other asset of a Federal reserve bank. In no event shall such collateral security be less than the amount of Federal Reserve notes applied for. The Federal Reserve agent shall each day notify the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of all issues and withdrawals of Federal Reserve notes to and by the Federal Reserve bank to which he is accredited. The said Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may at any time call upon a Federal Reserve bank for additional security to protect the Federal Reserve notes issued to it. Collateral shall not be required for Federal Reserve notes which are held in the vaults of, or are otherwise held by or on behalf of, Federal Reserve banks. Legal tender- Legal Tender also includes Federal Reserve notes as well as notes from Federal Reserve Banks and national banking associations for purposes of settling public and private debts, duties, dues, and taxes. Legal tender generally does not include personal checks, credit cards, or other general forms of noncash payments., the specific act of tendering the payment absolves the debt. '' The Bill of Exchange Act clearly says that the way to properly perform your bills are with interest. I know its not a common low people know, however I do. I have put in my application and attached my tender of payment with specific instructions for {$310000.00} plus any additional cost for warranties, insurance and delivery which is more than {$1.00}. 15 USC 1615. I have already stated that I am creditworthy. I understand that my current consumer report has some inaccurate and fraudulent accounts, however, I am rectifying all of my accounts and holding everyone accountable. I have read The Federal Reserve Act multiple times, but I have not come across the passage that calls a XXXX score into a consumer credit transaction, but I did read where congress calls consumer reporting agencies elaborate mechanisms. I understand that in a consumer credit transaction, I am extending my credit to you, and its discrimination to deny me access to something I applied for in good faith. I know that each consumer has an open ended credit plan, which is another reason I know I should be approved in this situation. I will preform all of my accounts, including this one, monthly for as long as the contract stays active. One of my inalienable right is the right to choose. I choose the best option for me and my family, and no one gets to take that away. This is my version of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. I dont want any special treatment, just what already belongs to me. My original instructions stated to have my XXXX delivered no later than Monday XX/XX/XXXX. You are already in breach of the contract. I will be filing a case with the SEC, CFPB, XXXX XXXX XXXX and FTC reports for every unauthorized use of my card. The CEO and CFO of your company and anyone else I feel needs to hear about this humongous error. I will be pursuing Section 29 of the Federal Reserve Act until I receive remedy. Civil Money Penalty ( d ) Maximum Amounts Of Penalties For Any Violation Described In Subsection ( c ). The maximum daily amount of any civil penalty which may be assessed pursuant to subsection ( c ) for any violation, practice, or breach described in such subsection is -- in the case of any person other than a member bank, an amount to not exceed {>= $1,000,000} ; and in the case of a member bank, an amount not to exceed the lesser of -- {>= $1,000,000} ; or 1 percent of the total assets of such member bank. 

such section ) and any such assessment shall be subject to the provisions of such section. Since I have applied my credit to this transaction on XX/XX/XXXX I have been deceived, lied to, mentally abused and discriminated against. My tender had specific instructions to have the automobile delivered no later than XX/XX/XXXX. Its now XX/XX/XXXX and no resolve has been made. It has now been 10 days since my application which has your total at XXXX XXXX dollars and counting. Not to mention the thousands you will have to pay in arbitration, and all my court fees on the back end. All I want is what is owed to the principal, a clean XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX keys and a full tank of premium gas or {$100000.00} in revolving credit. I have cited the law for you, and will remind you again that as a corporation, willful non compliance comes with many fines as well as possible prison time. 15 USC 1681n. I dont want to take this to arbitration or make this a lawsuit, but if my rights are going to continue to be violated I will. I have done my due diligence and now its time for you to do yours. Again all I want is what is owed to the principal, which is my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX delivered to me with two ( 2 ) working keys and a full tank of premium gas as requested or {$100000.00} in revolving credit. I would like this matter handled yesterday, however from Monday XX/XX/XXXX, you have 5 days, Friday XX/XX/XXXX to have my property delivered or I will be forced to take my next steps. I trust that you will treat this matter with the gravity it deserves and that you will collaborate with me to resolve this issues promptly.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I immediately started getting BOMBARDED with very bizarre, very invasive and scary e-mails from a supposed loan company calling themselves XXXX XXXX XXXX. Their e-mails make a very deliberate effort to look like someone with my personal information is applying for a large loan, when Ive never even heard of this company. Their e-mails show the last four digits of my SSN, my birthday ( off by exactly one month ), and my mobile phone number. Every previous CFPB case Ive filed where Im just trying to understand where this company came from has ended up in an unresolved black hole. They have a website, but its just filled with placeholder information and a Staff page comprised of reused photos of people from other companies. Their e-mails come from multiple bank domains. CFPB kept forwarding my reports to the FTC, because apparently no one can verify what this XXXX XXXX company actually is. This is very, very exhausting and confusing. And for the past four months, while this XXXX mystery kept attacking me, Ive been going through another horrific experience with another creditor : XXXX XXXX and their crummy unethical legal representatives, XXXX XXXX XXXX. They casually violate consumer disclosure laws by refusing to answer my serious concerns about my XXXX account. They lied and said I stopped making payments to justify a brute-forced lawsuit against me last year. They MIGHT be related to some new identity theft problems Im having, but I'm not sure. They hired a dodgy local attorney named XXXX XXXX, who used some fake-friendship routine at the last minute to make sure I didnt even have a trial about any of this. And every now and then, XXXX XXXX  XXXX takes potshots at my stressful mental state to further treat me like garbage. I could sit here writing essays about how my accumulated family problems lead to my money problems. But let me try to put this into the most straightforward perspective : Ive already been legally toyed around with by backstabbing, childish family members RIGHT after my father died from XXXX in XXXX, and in every year since then. Ive already been legally and financially violated. Ive had every basic human right and every estate survivor right ripped away from me by demented family trolls playing Hide and Seek games in e-mails and social media. The primary reason I cant promptly pay off my debt right now is due to half-a-dozen unresolved legal arguments constantly being hidden in the dark. AND THEN lawyers like those from XXXX XXXX pop out in their clown car and start doing their horrendous consumer-rights-violating comedy routine. So, Im a little on-edge over the whole debt / creditor situation right now, to say the very least. BUT thats an entirely different case, with an entirely different creditor, and I HOPE I never wind up in a similar malicious relationship with Discover Card. Heres what I need to know from Discover Cards representatives : What the heck is XXXX XXXX XXXX? Why did they start their games on the same day you were writing your response CFPB case XXXX? Do you have ANYTHING you can tell me that can help me understand this?",,"CAPITAL ONE, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION - GREENWOOD DELAWARE BRANCH",PA,159XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9762089

I have not given permission for FMA Alliance to access my consumer report, and there is no permissible purpose by law for this inquiry. I am a victim of identity theft. I have filed an identity theft report with my local police department and the FTC. ( see Evidence ) I have not initiated any transaction with FMA Alliance. Furthermore, I do not have an account as defined under 15 U.S.C. 1693a ( 2 ) with FMA Alliance for review or collection. I wrote to FMA Alliance on XX/XX/XXXX [ certified mail # XXXX ] and again on XX/XX/XXXX [ certified mail # XXXX ] to resolve this issue to no avail ( See Evidence ). I have requested the general or specific certifications pursuant to Rule 1002 required by 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) ( 2 ) to establish permissible purpose and they have provided no such documentation.

Details of Violation : Date of Unauthorized Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Consumer Reporting Agency : XXXX ( 1 violation ) By obtaining my consumer report on the aforementioned date without any permissible purpose, FMA Alliance is in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), codified at 15 U.S.C 1681b ( a ) 3 ( f ) ( i ), 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) ( 2 ), and15 U.S.C. 1681e ( a ). Therefore, FMA Alliance has committed 15 U.S.C. 1681q, which is tantamount to 18 U.S.C. 1028A. This statute invokes 15 U.S.C. 1681n ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), and I am owed remedy per violation.

I applied for and was approved for a Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select Card with a credit limit of {$14000.00}. At the end of the application process, there was an option to get a temporary card number. I planned to use this credit card to purchase my XXXX XXXX flight. The promotion offered up to a {$250.00} statement credit on eligible XXXX XXXX purchases in the first 6 months of account opening, plus XXXX bonus miles after {$2000.00} in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening. 

The XXXX XXXX website timed out or I might have close out of the tab, so I had to re-enter all of my information. By the time I was ready to input the credit card information, I couldn't find the tab with the temporary credit card number. I attempted to log into my new Citi account, but it said I needed the CSV on the back of my credit card. Since I was approved the same day, I won't receive my physical credit card for 7-10 business days.

I called Citi and spoke to 5-6 different agents. I was ultimately told that there was nothing they could do to trigger the temporary credit card number again and that I would need to wait until my physical card arrived. 

I believe I was deceived because the advertisement suggested I could use the credit card for the specific flight at a certain price. Now, I'll need to wait 7-10 business days to book the flight, and the specific flight will very likely be at a different price.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",UT,84094,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9777782
