Despite numerous disputes, these agencies continue to report open accounts inaccurately, falsely claiming that these accounts have been verified as accurate. This situation has caused significant damage to my credit profile, and I have exhausted all direct channels with the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. I am now seeking your assistance to ensure that my rights are protected, and that these violations are addressed promptly. The specific FCRA violations I have identified include : # # # Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violations - **15 USC 1681i ( a ) : Reinvestigations of Disputed Information** Requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable investigation of disputed information and correct or delete inaccurate information. - **15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Notice of Dispute** Requires that when a dispute is made, the credit reporting agency must notify the creditor or furnisher of the information being disputed. - **15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) : Prompt Deletion of Inaccurate Information** Mandates the deletion of inaccurate information from a credit report if the information can not be verified. - **15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 8 ) : Expedited Dispute Resolution** Provides that the credit reporting agency must resolve disputes in a timely manner, typically within 30 days. - **15 USC 1681b : Permissible Purpose of Reports** Limits the circumstances under which a credit report can be accessed, ensuring it is only used for permissible purposes such as credit evaluations. - **15 USC 1681e ( b ) : Accuracy and Integrity of Information** Requires that credit reporting agencies follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate and complete. - **15 USC 1681g : Disclosures to Consumers** Grants consumers the right to request and obtain a copy of their credit report and information about their credit file, including information that is being disputed. - **15 USC 1681h : Disclosure of Sources of Information** Requires that when a consumer disputes an item, the credit reporting agency must provide the consumer with the sources of the information. - **15 USC 1681m : Notice of Negative Information** Requires that if negative information is used in a credit decision, the consumer must be notified. - **15 USC 1681n : Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance** Allows consumers to seek damages for willful noncompliance with FCRA requirements. - **15 USC 1681o : Civil Liability for Negligent Noncompliance** Allows for damages in cases of negligent noncompliance with FCRA provisions . # # # Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Violations - **15 USC 1692d : ** Prohibits debt collectors from engaging in conduct that harasses, oppresses, or abuses any person. - **15 USC 1692j : ** Prohibits furnishing certain deceptive forms. - **15 USC 1692g : ** Requires debt collectors to provide validation of debts. - **Section 807 : ** Prohibits the use of any false, deceptive, or misleading representation. # # # Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Violations - **15 USC 1601 et seq. : TILA Disclosure Requirements** If any inaccuracies or discrepancies in the terms and disclosures of the accounts are found, they must be corrected immediately. # # # Additional Violations - **18 USC 1028 ( a ) ( 7 ) : ** Addresses issues related to identity theft. - **15 USC 1681a ( k ) ( B ) ( iv ) ( ll ) : ** Relates to the misuse of personal information. # # # Request for Expedited Deletion Under FCRA I demand the CFPB ensure these agencies comply with the following : - **15 USC 1681i ( a ) : Reinvestigations of Disputed Information** Upon receiving my dispute, the credit reporting agency must reinvestigate the disputed information.

He defaulted three times in XXXX, using my credit unlawfully from XXXX to XXXX, without my knowledge. This has unjustly impacted my credit history.

The property has been sold, and he was solely responsible for these defaults. Additionally, my ex-husband has a history of fraudulent actions. Another property mentioned in our divorce decree, a lake home referenced in line XXXX, was also sold using my credit until the date of its sale. His current wife, XXXX XXXX, fraudulently impersonated me and signed the papers to sell the property, acting as me. Despite my name being on the debt and mortgage until the date of sale, the sale documents were drafted in her name, not mine. I had to contact the title company to obtain the sale records to close on my current home and became of aware of this fraudulent action. I want no ties to this type of behavior nor the repercussions of other 's fraud. 

I urge you to rectify this issue immediately by removing these defaults from my XXXX XXXX.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to dispute inaccurate information on my credit report and request its removal if it can not be verified. The account in question was opened fraudulently using my personal information without my knowledge or consent. 

Upon contacting the collection agency to dispute this account, I was informed that they have the incorrect name associated with the account. Despite this acknowledgment, the collection account continues to appear on my credit report, causing significant harm to my creditworthiness. 
In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, I have the right to dispute inaccurate information on my credit report and have it corrected or removed if it can not be verified. The collection agency 's failure to correct this error and the continued presence of this incorrect information on my credit report is a clear violation of my rights under the FCRA.

3. Cease all collection activities related to this account.

4. Provide written confirmation that the account has been removed from my credit report.

I am requesting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that the collection agency and the credit reporting agencies comply with their obligations under the FCRA. This inaccurate information must be removed from my credit report promptly.

Please investigate this matter and instruct the collection agency and the credit reporting agencies to remove the incorrectly associated collection account from my credit report. I request a written confirmation once the investigation is complete and the account has been removed.

15 U.S.C 1681 section 604 A Section 2 : It also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish a account without my written instructions I am writing to file a complaint regarding inaccuracies on my credit report. Recently, I requested an investigation from the credit bureaus to ensure the accuracy of the information on my credit report. The credit bureaus conducted their investigation and concluded that all the information was accurate. 

However, after receiving their response, I conducted my own thorough review of my credit report. During my investigation, I identified several inaccuracies that the credit bureaus failed to address. These inaccuracies include [ describe the specific inaccuracies you found, such as incorrect account balances, outdated information, accounts that do not belong to you, etc. ]. 

Despite the credit bureaus ' assertion that the information was accurate, my findings indicate that their investigation was insufficient and did not address the errors present in my report. This has caused me considerable distress and has potentially impacted my credit score and financial standing.

2024-07-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Please see the attached as evidence on both the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX negatively reported accounts. 
All three CRAs have stated they verified the XXXX XXXX TAB account and have found me to be lying and, through FCRA investigation requirements, have concluded, based on documentation, account, and billing statements, specific inquiry into my incessant claims of having on XX/XX/XXXX reported immediately to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Department of fraudulent transactions due to identity theft, a listing of the XXXX hotels that are under the same parent company, the employees involved, and how the fraud occurred, for which each time over XXXX months I called to check status of investigation and holding these fraudulent actors accountable. I have spoken twice with XXXX XXXX XXXX, as requested via email. Both times, the following was stated to me ; We were never asked, inquired about, nor provided any documentation on the fraudulent occurrences due to identity theft because the CRAs only requested verification of the account being obtained. On my own and for me, so because you filed complaints through the CFPB, which has no bearing on us, and because the XXXX was requesting verification of your opening the account as owner, we will not provide you or them with any further information. It would have been best if you had come only through us, but because you didnt, we are not offering any additional information about the fraud due to identity theft transactions. I am requesting the CFPB either request the time-stamped documentation, billing, and transactional history, the reporting history, and the information requested by each CRA of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to the fraudulent transactions due to identity theft, as each has stated repeatedly they have acted by FCRA guidelines and have determined to leave this negatively reported dishonest, fraudulent account on my credit file when the original creditor states they have neither requested nor received such information, simply verification the account was my own. I am requesting the CFPB to investigate these investigative processes as well as refer this case to the XXXX XXXX, which can investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX. All I am doing is further stating that if this is commissioned and if I am found to have been dishonest, misled, misrepresented, and committed fraud on a federal site against a federal agency, I will be criminally charged and held fully accountable. I attest again to the CFPB and the CRAs here, as an oath, XXXX XXXX TAB is knowingly, willfully, and intentionally committing additional fraud and has stated my filing complaints has sealed my fate. However, I am sure of my telling the truth, which in turn makes me sure that the CRAs have not investigated, have not had the time-stamped documentation, statements, transactional history, etc., called for under FCRA, XXXX this account would have long ago been deleted. Attached is the proof of mailing XXXX priority receipt all documents to XXXX XXXX inclusive of the FTC, CFPB complaints, the Notice XXXX XXXX and obligations of Furnishers with the returned file torn open and then refused, which was admitted to. 
On the second negatively reported account, LVNV and Credit XXXX, I also have attached proof of their both receiving the same file PRIOR to then reporting negatively against FCRA guidelines, and further, a Letter of Verification from XXXX XXXX for all CRAs to delete all negative accounts connected to Credit XXXX. This is being refused. 

While XXXX and Equifax have demonstrated professionalism, respect, and compliance with the FCRA and the CFPB and have been communicative, efficient, and 95 % fair while adhering to laws, regulations, and guidelines, I request a thorough investigation into these XXXX accounts. I am seeking a conclusive outcome that addresses any potential criminal implications for myself and the conduct of the XXXX CRAs and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX has in total, and with total disregard for FCRA, the CFPB, myself, and likely thousands of other consumers like myself who should unite ; I am requesting a full review, investigation, and an investigation into the comprehensive, willful, intentional neglect, actions, and harm imposed on myself through unlawful reporting, inaccurate systemic inaccurate and false reporting, failure to investigate, to give an adequate response, failure to communicate, and a willful disregard of FCRA, the FTC, CFPB guidelines and oversight as is pervasive throughout my account, and is most likely a strong, reasonable conclusive objectively derived necessitation for a comprehensive investigation as their having a systemic, foundational, and operational deficiency that possibly hundreds of thousands citizens of specific statuses, economic levels, and class of our society is facing daily, and the overall economic harm being caused to our country. When XXXX months later, after multiple accounts unlawfully stating accounts as XXXX in chapter XXXX bankruptcy while still providing amounts owed, past due, negative delinquencies ; While taking a title-loan that was closed and written off over a year ago with an original debt and total debt owed even according to the creditor of {$3800.00} and less than XXXX months later, XXXX intentionally XXXX credit by taking that amount up by a 300 % interest rate to now show me owing over {$11000.00} and growing every month, increasing debt amount, the amount owed and being repeatedly disputed as an unlawful, intentional fraud to cause my credit and financial standing continued harm is not operational malfunction at a single level ; it is along with all other unlawful actions evidence of a pervasive systematic unfair, improper act against most likely the lower 30 % of our country. If XXXX were to ask the original creditor what amount would satisfy the debt, and the answer is {$3800.00}, why is XXXX stating to all possible creditors that the number is nearly 300 % higher and growing? How does XXXX knowingly and intentionally leave a fraudulent account due to fraud on my report for over XXXX years, knowing it was removed from every other CRA immediately, inclusive of XXXX, and then placed back on my credit file? Especially after XXXX XXXX, XXXX of the creditors from XXXX, has agreed it is unlawful and incorrect? Why does XXXX report completely inaccurate information on almost every account? Is it objectively clear, and refuses to fix it? Why does XXXX not once mail out a copy of my credit report, an explanation of an investigation, and never once find that a single dispute results in a finding in my favor, even when clearly evident? XXXX has never once investigated under FCRA as guided and has never once responded to a single complaint, dispute, or factual unlawful act by repairing it. XXXX XXXX was sent pages of substantial, incessant, harmful, unlawful, and inaccurate complaints, to which they responded the issues had already been raised. Nothing about the issues being addressed, nothing about correcting the issues, and I am requesting the CFPB, given my persistence in bringing forward significant, numerous, continual unlawful, anti-regulatory, actions that have caused me financial harm at the highest level, simply request XXXX to provide time-stamped documentation, tangible information, a listing of what measures XXXX used in investigating issues raised and an explanation why they repeatedly act unlawfully, incompetently, and with such disregard to FCRA in the pursuit of harming an entire status of class in our society and review them from a large segment of our citizenry that is devastating the financial strength, capability, and increasing inequitably the challenges when this segment and class of our society is the least empowered already.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TN,38122,,Consent provided,Web,2024-07-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9574780

Per my XXXX divorce decree ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX ) filed and XX/XX/XXXX, page XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX  number XXXX, my ex-husband was responsible for refinancing and maintaining the property. He defaulted three times in XXXX, using my credit unlawfully from XXXX to XXXX, without my knowledge. This has unjustly impacted my credit history. I became aware when I went to purchase my current home. 

The property has been sold, and he was solely responsible for these defaults. Additionally, my ex-husband has a history of fraudulent actions. Another property mentioned in our divorce decree, a lake home referenced in line XXXX, was also sold using my credit until the date of its sale. His current wife, XXXX XXXX, fraudulently impersonated me and signed the papers to sell the property, acting as me. Despite my name being on the debt and mortgage until the date of sale, the sale documents were drafted in her name, not mine. I had to contact the title company to obtain the sale records to close on my current home and became of aware of this fraudulent action. I want no ties to this type of behavior nor the repercussions of other 's fraud.

I urge you to rectify this issue immediately by removing these defaults from my credit score.

15 U.S.C 1681 Section 604 A Section 2 emphasizes that a consumer reporting agency can not furnish an account without my written instructions.

15 U.S.C 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) Section states that no consumer reporting agency may include certain adverse items of information in a consumer report, particularly any other adverse item of information that antedates the report by more than seven years.

Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) stipulates that a person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

These violations not only compromise my privacy but also infringe upon the fundamental principles outlined in the FCRA. I request a thorough investigation into this matter and appropriate action to rectify these breaches.

I spoke with an agent who advised that I must pay the loan agreement amount of {$560.00} opposed to what their system shows on their phone app. This information is misleading and confusing as a customer. I thought that I was paying what was owed due to what their system reflects just to find out that I can't trust the amount noted on the app. I also was never called as they had the incorrect number listed for myself and my husband, however in the app my phone information is listed correctly as when I need to verify my account they text me on the correct number to allow access to my account. I am also not receiving the hardcopy statements hence as to why I go strictly off of what the app reflects.

2024-07-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally dispute the unauthorized furnishing of my personal credit information by your bureau and company. According to my recent credit report, there are entries that I did not authorize and which I believe are in violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This is the 6 letter and dispute I have sent to the creditors along with my police report, FTC report, and supporting identity documents verifying my identity. I indicated in all my letters and police report that I am indeed a victim of identity theft, and this credit bureau and credit companies are violating my consumer rights and not protecting me as an American consumer according to the stated laws. This is my 6th notice to the bureau and the creditor companies notifying them that these listed accounts are fraud. My information isnt protected and this credit bureau or creditors are not honoring my identity theft claim. My 7th notice of litigation will be a lawsuit suing this credit bureau and all these creditors, these companies and credit bureau did not honor my rights or acknowledge my supporting documents regarding identity theft. I was incarcerated for 10 years with proof when all these accounts were open illegally and fraudulently and Ive proven this matter and will prove it in court without a doubt, Im going to sue for my rights being violated, pain and suffering, false allegations from creditors, and assisting to furnish wrong and fraudulent accounts. I demand all accounts and inquiries be removed as soon as possible. 

Specifically, I refer to the following entries : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX {$37000.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX {$53000.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX {$500.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX {$1000.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX {$2500.00} XXXX. XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX {$530.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$410.00} XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX {$970.00} XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Under the FCRA, 15 U.S. Code 1681b , consumer reporting agencies may furnish a consumer report only under specific circumstances, such as with the consumers written consent or in connection with a credit transaction initiated by the consumer. I did not provide my consent for the release or sharing of my personal information related to these accounts, nor did I initiate any credit transactions with the entities listed.

Furthermore, 15 U.S. Code 1681c requires that consumer reporting agencies ensure the accuracy and privacy of consumer information. The unauthorized disclosure of my information not only violates this statute but also exposes me to potential identity theft and other forms of financial harm.

I request that you take the following actions : 1. **Conduct an immediate investigation** : As required by 15 U.S. Code 1681i, I request that you investigate these unauthorized entries on my credit report.
2. **Remove the disputed entries** : If the investigation finds these entries were indeed unauthorized, they must be promptly removed from my credit report.

3. **Provide written confirmation** : Send me a written confirmation that the unauthorized entries have been removed from my credit report.

4. **Send an updated credit report** : Provide me with a current copy of my credit report to verify the corrections.

Enclosed are copies of the relevant documents, including my recent credit report highlighting the disputed entries and any supporting documents that substantiate my claim.

Please consider this letter as a formal complaint and take all necessary actions to resolve this matter within the 30-day timeframe stipulated by the FCRA. Failure to do so may result in further legal action to protect my rights. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious matter.

2024-07-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to formally dispute the unauthorized furnishing of my personal credit information by your bureau and company. According to my recent credit report, there are entries that I did not authorize and which I believe are in violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This is the 6 letter and dispute I have sent to the creditors along with my police report, FTC report, and supporting identity documents verifying my identity. I indicated in all my letters and police report that I am indeed a victim of identity theft, and this credit bureau and credit companies are violating my consumer rights and not protecting me as an American consumer according to the stated laws. This is my 6th notice to the bureau and the creditor companies notifying them that these listed accounts are fraud. My information isnt protected and this credit bureau or creditors are not honoring my identity theft claim. My 7th notice of litigation will be a lawsuit suing this credit bureau and all these creditors, these companies and credit bureau did not honor my rights or acknowledge my supporting documents regarding identity theft. I was incarcerated for 10 years with proof when all these accounts were open illegally and fraudulently and Ive proven this matter and will prove it in court without a doubt, Im going to sue for my rights being violated, pain and suffering, false allegations from creditors, and assisting to furnish wrong and fraudulent accounts. I demand all accounts and inquiries be removed as soon as possible. 

Specifically, I refer to the following entries : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2. Wells Fargo Auto XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Under the FCRA, 15 U.S. Code 1681b , consumer reporting agencies may furnish a consumer report only under specific circumstances, such as with the consumers written consent or in connection with a credit transaction initiated by the consumer. I did not provide my consent for the release or sharing of my personal information related to these accounts, nor did I initiate any credit transactions with the entities listed. 

Furthermore, 15 U.S. Code 1681c requires that consumer reporting agencies ensure the accuracy and privacy of consumer information. The unauthorized disclosure of my information not only violates this statute but also exposes me to potential identity theft and other forms of financial harm. 

I request that you take the following actions : 1. **Conduct an immediate investigation** : As required by 15 U.S. Code 1681i, I request that you investigate these unauthorized entries on my credit report. 
XXXX. **Remove the disputed entries** : If the investigation finds these entries were indeed unauthorized, they must be promptly removed from my credit report. 
XXXX. **Provide written confirmation** : Send me a written confirmation that the unauthorized entries have been removed from my credit report. 
XXXX. **Send an updated credit report** : Provide me with a current copy of my credit report to verify the corrections. 

Enclosed are copies of the relevant documents, including my recent credit report highlighting the disputed entries and any supporting documents that substantiate my claim. 

Please consider this letter as a formal complaint and take all necessary actions to resolve this matter within the XXXX timeframe stipulated by the FCRA. Failure to do so XXXX result in further legal action to protect my rights.

I called the number left in the VM. I spoke with XXXX XXXX. She stated she was the Senior Paralegal for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX at XXXXZoca Loans. She stated that on XX/XX/XXXX, I took an {$800.00} loan. She provided me with the email address of XXXX. I told her that was not my email and she said it did not matter. She gave me two four-digit numbers stating these were the last four of the routing number and account number, but was not sure which was which. She provided me with my full SSN, all assets attached to my SSN, my email address, my physical address and threatened to garnish my wages and seize my assets and put liens on my bank accounts. She stated they were going to start arbitration and litigation if i did not pay them {$6900.00} ( the amount i owed with interest ). I searched all my bank accounts and i did not have any deposits in my account from any of the companies stated in that amount on that date. I did have a loan on that date, but it was from a different company, with a different name and has been paid in full. I did have an account with XXXX, which was closed in XXXX with no balance or pending charges. I told her I have never pulled a loan from XXXX and have never heard of Zoca Loans. I requested they send me the letters they allegedly sent to me notifying me of this debt. She stated she could not. She stated that the actual reason for her call was to get my attorney information since I failed to respond to any of their communications. I told her this was the first I heard of this and needed some proof. She stated she could not send my anything, the call was being recorded and she would let XXXX XXXX listen to our conversation and make a decision on the next steps. After a brief hold, she came back on the line. She stated that she was not supposed to collect monies, but an exception would be made. She stated that XXXX XXXX agreed to two options for collection on this debt. I could pay XXXX payments of {$280.00}, making a good faith payment that day and the rest at my leisure or pay a settlement of {$1700.00} - three payments of {$590.00}, making a good faith payment that day. Unsure of what to do as I was not given the opportunity to make calls and call them back, I paid the settlement amount. I did not want to chance this being real and getting my non-profit seized, wages garnished and losing my car and bank accounts. She sent me a receipt for the transaction, gave me a confirmation code, and her direct phone number ( XXXX XXXX ). Immediately, I contacted XXXX and asked to speak to their loan department. The agent verified that my account was closed in XXXX and there were no loans taken out in my name or SSN. I gave him my full SSN to run through their system. I gave him the numbers she provided me as the last four of the routing and account numbers. He stated those were not numbers associated with the account I had with them. I provided him with all the phone numbers used in this interaction and he stated none of those numbers are associated with XXXX. After this verification, I contacted my credit card company and filed a fraudulent charge and froze all three of my credit reports. When the charge went through, there was a completely different company on the charge, XXXX XXXX XXXX. The receipt emailed to me had XXXX XXXX  on the letterhead with an address in NY. When I researched that address, it did not show this company in that location. I did not file a police report as I felt filing here would be sufficient.

2024-07-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Please see the attached as evidence on both the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX negatively reported accounts. 
All three CRAs have stated they verified the XXXX XXXX TAB account and have found me to be lying and, through FCRA investigation requirements, have concluded, based on documentation, account, and billing statements, specific inquiry into my incessant claims of having on XX/XX/XXXX reported immediately to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Department of fraudulent transactions due to identity theft, a listing of the XXXX hotels that are under the same parent company, the employees involved, and how the fraud occurred, for which each time over XXXX months I called to check status of investigation and holding these fraudulent actors accountable. I have spoken twice with XXXX XXXX XXXX, as requested via email. Both times, the following was stated to me ; We were never asked, inquired about, nor provided any documentation on the fraudulent occurrences due to identity theft because the CRAs only requested verification of the account being obtained. On my own and for me, so because you filed complaints through the CFPB, which has no bearing on us, and because the XXXX was requesting verification of your opening the account as owner, we will not provide you or them with any further information. It would have been best if you had come only through us, but because you didnt, we are not offering any additional information about the fraud due to identity theft transactions. I am requesting the CFPB either request the time-stamped documentation, billing, and transactional history, the reporting history, and the information requested by each CRA of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to the fraudulent transactions due to identity theft, as each has stated repeatedly they have acted by FCRA guidelines and have determined to leave this negatively reported dishonest, fraudulent account on my credit file when the original creditor states they have neither requested nor received such information, simply verification the account was my own. I am requesting the CFPB to investigate these investigative processes as well as refer this case to the XXXX XXXX, which can investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX. All I am doing is further stating that if this is commissioned and if I am found to have been dishonest, misled, misrepresented, and committed fraud on a federal site against a federal agency, I will be criminally charged and held fully accountable. I attest again to the CFPB and the CRAs here, as an oath, XXXX XXXX TAB is knowingly, willfully, and intentionally committing additional fraud and has stated my filing complaints has sealed my fate. However, I am sure of my telling the truth, which in turn makes me sure that the CRAs have not investigated, have not had the time-stamped documentation, statements, transactional history, etc., called for under FCRA, XXXX this account would have long ago been deleted. Attached is the proof of mailing XXXX priority receipt all documents to XXXX XXXX inclusive of the FTC, CFPB complaints, the Notice XXXX XXXX and obligations of Furnishers with the returned file torn open and then refused, which was admitted to. 
On the second negatively reported account, LVNV and Credit XXXX, I also have attached proof of their both receiving the same file PRIOR to then reporting negatively against FCRA guidelines, and further, a Letter of Verification from XXXX XXXX for all CRAs to delete all negative accounts connected to Credit XXXX. This is being refused. 

While XXXX and XXXX have demonstrated professionalism, respect, and compliance with the FCRA and the CFPB and have been communicative, efficient, and 95 % fair while adhering to laws, regulations, and guidelines, I request a thorough investigation into these XXXX accounts. I am seeking a conclusive outcome that addresses any potential criminal implications for myself and the conduct of the XXXX CRAs and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Experian has in total, and with total disregard for FCRA, the CFPB, myself, and likely thousands of other consumers like myself who should unite ; I am requesting a full review, investigation, and an investigation into the comprehensive, willful, intentional neglect, actions, and harm imposed on myself through unlawful reporting, inaccurate systemic inaccurate and false reporting, failure to investigate, to give an adequate response, failure to communicate, and a willful disregard of FCRA, the FTC, CFPB guidelines and oversight as is pervasive throughout my account, and is most likely a strong, reasonable conclusive objectively derived necessitation for a comprehensive investigation as their having a systemic, foundational, and operational deficiency that possibly hundreds of thousands citizens of specific statuses, economic levels, and class of our society is facing daily, and the overall economic harm being caused to our country. When XXXX months later, after multiple accounts unlawfully stating accounts as XXXX in chapter XXXX bankruptcy while still providing amounts owed, past due, negative delinquencies ; While taking a title-loan that was closed and written off over a year ago with an original debt and total debt owed even according to the creditor of {$3800.00} and less than XXXX months later, Experian intentionally XXXX credit by taking that amount up by a XXXX % interest rate to now show me owing over {$XXXX} and growing every month, increasing debt amount, the amount owed and being repeatedly disputed as an unlawful, intentional fraud to cause my credit and financial standing continued harm is not operational malfunction at a single level ; it is along with all other unlawful actions evidence of a pervasive systematic unfair, improper act against most likely the lower XXXX % of our country. If Experian were to ask the original creditor what amount would satisfy the debt, and the answer is {$XXXX}, why is Experian stating to all possible creditors that the number is nearly 300 % higher and growing? How does Experian knowingly and intentionally leave a fraudulent account due to fraud on my report for over XXXX years, knowing it was removed from every other CRA immediately, inclusive of Experian, and then placed back on my credit file? Especially after XXXX XXXX, XXXX of the creditors from XXXX, has agreed it is unlawful and incorrect? Why does Experian report completely inaccurate information on almost every account? Is it objectively clear, and refuses to fix it? Why does Experian not once mail out a copy of my credit report, an explanation of an investigation, and never once find that a single dispute results in a finding in my favor, even when clearly evident? Experian has never once investigated under FCRA as guided and has never once responded to a single complaint, dispute, or factual unlawful act by repairing it. Experian Legal was sent pages of substantial, incessant, harmful, unlawful, and inaccurate complaints, to which they responded the issues had already been raised. Nothing about the issues being addressed, nothing about correcting the issues, and I am requesting the CFPB, given my persistence in bringing forward significant, numerous, continual unlawful, anti-regulatory, actions that have caused me financial harm at the highest level, simply request Experian to provide time-stamped documentation, tangible information, a listing of what measures Experian used XXXX investigating issues raised and an explanation why they repeatedly act unlawfully, incompetently, and with such disregard to FCRA in XXXX pursuit of harming an entire status of class in our society and review them from a large segment of our citizenry that is devastating the financial strength, capability, and increasing inequitably the challenges when this segment and class of our society is the least empowered already.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TN,38122,,Consent provided,Web,2024-07-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9570928

Recently, I received notifications from all three major credit bureaus indicating that this entity has reported a collections account under my name. I have never consented to any debt collection practices by this entity, nor have I entered into any agreement that would authorize them to report a debt on my behalf. In addition, not only did they give inaccurate information in reference to the address but the address given is for a state they are bonded to engage in debt collection activities or to report collections accounts to the credit bureaus. Their actions have caused me undue stress and XXXX coupled with damaging my credit standing ( XXXX XXXX ) This constitutes a clear violation of my consumer rights along with potential violations of state and federal regulations governing debt collection practices. Because of this, I will be seeking compensation in the form of monetary and non-monetary ( Removal of unauthorized reported collections account ) compensation and ask that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau promptly investigate this matter.

15 U.S.C 1681 Section 604 A Section 2 emphasizes that a consumer reporting agency can not furnish an account without my written instructions.

15 U.S.C 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) Section states that no consumer reporting agency may include certain adverse items of information in a consumer report, particularly any other adverse item of information that antedates the report by more than seven years.

Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) stipulates that a person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

These violations not only compromise my privacy but also infringe upon the fundamental principles outlined in the FCRA. I request a thorough investigation into this matter and appropriate action to rectify these breaches.

I spoke with an agent who advised that I must pay the loan agreement amount of {$560.00} opposed to what their system shows on their phone app. This information is misleading and confusing as a customer. I thought that I was paying what was owed due to what their system reflects just to find out that I can't trust the amount noted on the app. I also was never called as they had the incorrect number listed for myself and my husband, however in the app my phone information is listed correctly as when I need to verify my account they text me on the correct number to allow access to my account. I am also not receiving the hardcopy statements hence as to why I go strictly off of what the app reflects. I have paid the lesser amount as shown on my account in XX/XX/2024, XX/XX/2024 as based off what the app payment amount due reflected and was not penalized for paying less than the {$560.00}.

2024-07-21,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"I discovered a noticeable increase of monthly payment amounts applied to interest and decrease in principal. I called XXXX to ask and the agent, who admitted not understanding finance, a per diem dollar rate was being assessed. This was not in the contract nor could be a linear value, as any timely payment table would require. 

I escalated and received a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on XX/XX/2024. Here it was stated basically that Bridgecrest has no responsibility for the loan. 

Quote "" XXXX XXXX : Bridgecrest is in receipt of your email below. Please note that Bridgecrest is the servicer of your account and is neither the originator nor the holder. We have forwarded your email regarding your contract to XXXX and encourage you to reach out to them for any questions or concerns that you may have. 

Please let us know if you have any additional questions '' I'd said below : "" Per discussions, there is no contract point that binds parties to a rate, or derived, calculable amount, to conclude a per diem of {$9.00} per day for each day from the date of the previous month 's payment. '' Then in response to XXXX XXXX : Dear XXXX, My appreciation for responding. 

I do hope you and Bridgecrest will recognize the significance of the underlying issue, it's breadth, depth, and potential impact if not immediately met with proposed and satisfactory remedy. My loan instruments are not the only ones. 

Notwithstanding the XXXX and Bridgecrest relationship in forming the language, XXXX addressing practices observed, evidenced, and conceded as fact which Bridgecrest took and continues to take as the loan servicer. And this again, despite XXXX originating the loan. 

Bridgecrest 's role as the servicer does not absolve it of legal accountability. The following highlight Bridgecrest 's culpability and potential violations of state and federal law, regardless of its status as a non-originator : As the servicer, Bridgecrest has a fiduciary responsibility to manage the loan according to the terms disclosed to the borrower. The loan agreement lacks any specific rate or calculable amount justifying a per diem of {$9.00} per day from the date of the previous month 's payment. This absence of disclosure violates the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), codified at 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., which mandates that lenders and servicers disclose all terms and conditions of credit. Bridgecrests failure to ensure this transparency breaches its legal obligations under federal law. 

Bridgecrest 's financial practices have involved the use of undisclosed terms and rates, constituting deceptive trade practices under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act ( DTPA ), codified at XXXX. XXXX. & XXXX. Code XXXX et seq. The inconsistency between verbal statements and the written contract indicates a deliberate intent to mislead the borrower. As the servicer, Bridgecrest is responsible for ensuring that all communications and calculations are accurate and truthful ( XXXX. XXXX. & XXXX. Code XXXX ). 

Bridgecrest 's method of calculating and applying finance charges violates the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Specifically, the practice of charging interest on the down payment, or misapplication month to month, either of which constitutes the borrowers own cash and asset liquidity, is illegal. XXXX. Fin. Code XXXX ( b ) requires that interest must be clearly agreed upon and should not artificially inflate the principal. As the servicer, Bridgecrest is accountable for ensuring that interest calculations comply with state law. Remedies for violations include the forfeiture of principal or interest, or both, as provided under XXXX. Fin. Code 305.001. Here I will begin to seek voluntary refund as a potential mitigation avenue prior to taking more adversarial positioning.

Bridgecrest 's failure to deliver a copy of the TILA disclosures is a federal violation under 15 U.S.C. 1638. Without these disclosures, the borrower can not determine the true interest rate, undermining their ability to make informed financial decisions. As the servicer, Bridgecrest must ensure these disclosures are provided.

Bridgecrests use of undisclosed rates and charges constitutes a material breach of contract under Texas law. Even as the servicer, Bridgecrest is bound to administer the loan according to the terms set forth in the contract. The clandestine methodologies employed by Bridgecrest in the deployment of these terms violate the fundamental agreement between the borrower and the lender. Remedies for breach of contract in Texas may absolutely cause for surrender of any underlying asset as fully outlined in XXXX. XXXX. & XXXX. Code XXXX. 

Bridgecrest 's illegal practices will necessitate reporting to the appropriate financial regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) under 12 U.S.C. 5491 et seq. for federal violations and the Texas Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner under Tex. Fin. Code 14.201 et seq. for state violations.

Bridgecrest can not evade accountability through its role as the servicer ; complicity in these practices, whether due to internal directives or failure to act, does not exempt it from legal consequences.

Awaiting your next reply and a firm avenue of resolution prior to escalation.

If you have questions, you're welcome to call.

If you need further information or documents in support, I'm glad to share preemptively.

Sincerely, Justin Long '' I must conclude now that the terms being used by the Bridgecrest financial department are not disclosed to the borrower. This is against the law, first and foremost, and your duty should be to report this conduct to financial regulators. 
Based on the only clause I can find, the verbal provisions are incorrect, and the contract is written such that it will exceed the sales price in time. This violates its own terms and I am obligated not to pay. Since I am aware the contract is illegal, I won't be complicit. 
Such a contract is not viable or enforceable in the State of Texas or elsewhere I'm aware.

You ( Bridgecrest ) are on notice for failure to deliver a copy of "" TILA '', or the Truth in Lending disclosures. This is a federal violation of consumer protection law. This was said to be delivered but I state it never was, or can be, when the *true* interest rate can not be known.

The below language is both inconsistent with verbal explanation and considered deceptive trade. Complaints to be filed with the appropriate agencies barring timely and proper resolution. 
"" We will figure the XXXX XXXX by applying the true daily earnings method, as defined by the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Using this method, the XXXX XXXX will be figured by applying the daily rate to the unpaid portion of the Amount Financed for the number of days the unpaid portion of the XXXX XXXX is outstanding. The daily rate is XXXX of the contract rate. The unpaid principal balance does not include the late charges or returned payment charges, if any. '' I have on record the Bridgecrest financial division stating that there is a daily dollar rate, which is cumulatively applied to interest each term ( monthly or thereabouts ). This rate was stated first to be {$9.00}, then the senior financial person corrected to say the rate is a per diem of {$9.00}. The rate cycle is initiated, or "" restarts '', upon clearing of the previous payment remittance. 
Such a rate could not be fixed, as it is a factor of the *remaining* balance, which presumably, is an ever decreasing amount. I submit that Bridgecrest does not intend to lower the principal and is committing acts deliberately intended to preclude principal reduction, also illegal.

Despite my repeated attempts to resolve this issue directly with Synchrony Bank, the matter remains unresolved, and I am seeking the CFPBs assistance. 

Background : 1. Fraudulent Account : Between XXXX and XXXX, an unauthorized credit card account was opened in my name with Synchrony Bank. I did not apply for or authorize this account. 
2. Unauthorized Transactions : Unauthorized individuals accessed my mailbox and used my checkbook details to make unauthorized ACH payments to this fraudulent account. Additionally, my phone was stolen, and my safe, containing my Social Security number and other personal information, was broken into. 
3. Reporting the Fraud : Upon discovering the fraudulent activity, I immediately contacted Synchrony Bank to dispute the charges. I also reported the issue to the police and filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 

Issues with Synchrony Bank : 1. Failure to Investigate : Synchrony Bank failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into the disputed account, continued to report inaccurate information to credit reporting agencies, and pursued collection efforts against me by suing in me in civil court. 
2. Inadequate Response : Despite providing Synchrony Bank with evidence of the fraud, including the police report and FTC Identity Theft Report, they have not taken appropriate action to resolve the issue or correct the fraudulent information on my credit report. 

3. Unfair Practices : Synchrony Banks continued attempts to collect the fraudulent debt, despite being informed of the identity theft, constitute harassment and unfair debt collection practices. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in resolving this issue promptly.

I was skeptical to accept it because of problems I had had with a XXXX 's credit Card issued through Synchrony. ( Note : XXXX 's has since cease to do business with Synchrony and has switched to XXXX XXXX. 

I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and have had XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an EFT payment of {$50.00} to the account. This was not a regular, scheduled payment, but an extra payment to reduce my outstanding balance. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an EFT payment of {$100.00}. Again this was an extra payment. Several days later, when I went online to check my account I notice that the payment had not been credited and there was a {$30.00} fee from Synchrony.

I contacted Synchrony and was told that the payment had not gone trough because of a numerical error in either the tracking number or the account number. 

I immediately contacted Sychrony, gave them the XXXX number and asked that they remove the {$30.00}. They refused. After escalatling my complaint they removed the {$30.00} charge. ( Subject of my previous complaint ) On XX/XX/XXXX I made an extra payment of {$100.00} and On XX/XX/XXXX I made an extra payment of {$200.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received notification from my internet provider that my automatic scheduled payment of {$13.00} was denied by Synchrony, I contacted the provider and made sure that they had the right information. I then contacted synchrony was told that my account had been cancelled and that I would be receiving a letter informing me of their decision to cancel my account. Even though I escalated my complaint, no one at Synchrony would discuss the cancellation with me.

When I tried to view my account online, I discovered that I was locked out of my account and could not access any of the information needed to file this complaint. Synchrony has refused to allow me access to my online information. I need that information in order to file a complaint with the Commonwealth of Massachuetts under MGL c92A ( the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute ).

Cancelling an account due a numeric information error which was immediately corrected ; refusing to honor a charge that was scheduled before I was informed of the account closure and hiding my online financial records from me is unconscionable, but wholly typical of the management 's attitude at Synchrony Financial.

I have contacted senior management at Verizon whose name and logo appear on the card and, apparentl

Background : On XX/XX/2024, I submitted a dispute letter to XXXX challenging inaccuracies on my credit report. Enclosed with my dispute letter, I provided the following notarized documents as proof of my identity and address : A copy of my driver 's license A copy of my Social Security card A proof of residence document These documents were included to fulfill XXXX 's requirements for verifying my identity and address. I took extra care to ensure that all provided documentation was clear, legible, and properly notarized. 
Issue : Despite submitting all necessary and properly notarized documents, I received a response from XXXX stating that my dispute could not be processed because I did not include the proper documentation for proof of address. This response is both inaccurate and unjustified, as I have complied with all the requirements set forth by XXXX. 
Violation of Rights : XXXX 's failure to acknowledge and properly review the provided documentation is a direct violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). According to the FCRA, consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate information on their credit reports and must be provided with a fair and reasonable investigation of their dispute.

Prior to the XXXX autopayment, to be processed XXXX, I contacted Synchrony Bank by phone on XXXX and was told by their agent that the interest fee had already been credited back to my account. However, it had not been and my autopayment on XXXX included this interest charge. It also is not included in pending transactions. 

Today, I attempted to use their online system, since calling customer service did not resolve the issue. After several attempts my message did not show in the sent messages folder. This has been a chronic issue with Synchrony Bank. I have made them aware of the issues with this app on numerous occasions, yet they have made no attempt to correct it. This complacency is unacceptable for any industry, but particularly disturbing when it involves a financial institution. 

On XXXX I attempted to use this card to pay for airline tickets and it was refused and my account was suspended. I called Synchrony and was told it was not their fault, but the airline told us different. XXXX XXXX requires 3rd party verification as a security precaution and Synchrony 's system is clearly not equipped to handle this. I subsequently used my XXXX XXXX card without issue. Additionally, they required me to verify all transactions that had occurred in the last several days before they would restore my account, These were all local transactions, made in my home town and were not questioned until the airline ticket incident.

Recently, I requested an investigation from the credit bureaus to ensure the accuracy of the information on my credit report.

These inaccuracies include [ describe the specific inaccuracies you found, such as incorrect account balances, outdated information, accounts that do not belong to you, etc. ].

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX, a supervisor in the Fraud Department who advised that she would expedite the reopening of the account in order for the funds to be transferred and to call on XX/XX/XXXX because this process usually took between 7-10 days. At this time, I instructed Marcus Bank to provide the funds in a check as the origination account was closed with XXXX XXXX XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX, a representative in the Fraud Department who advised the initiation of the reopening of the account was still in process. I was then transferred to XXXX XXXX same supervisor I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX ) who said there was nothing to do at this time as the Review Department was still reviewing the alleged expedited request. I asked to be transferred to the Review Department and was advised that was prohibited. I asked to be transferred to someone higher than a supervisor and was told that was prohibited, they can all call you, you can not call them or be transferred. I asked XXXX to leave a note with a higher supervisor in addition with the Review Department to contact me. To date, I did not receive a call from the Review Department. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX who advised that the expedited link was expiring to reopen my account. XXXX provided me with a newer case number upon request as it seems the Supervisors in the Fraud Department tried to reopen the second CD account and not the first which was funded over a year ago. I put in a complaint with Marcus Bank and later that evening I received an email to call Marcus. I was advised the supervisor had left for the day by XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX, an advanced supervisor whose demeanor left much to be desired. She advised that this matter was still being processed and there was nothing for her to do other than to wait and call back. 

After XXXX ( XXXX ) year, XXXX ( XXXX ) calls with various supervisors in the Fraud Department, one ( 1 ) complaint with the company, and two ( 2 ) requests to be contacted by the Review Department, this matter is still pending.

At this juncture, I enacted a Power of Attorney as this matter seems to be cumbersome with XXXX Bank and their determination to keep my monies from me. It appears that Marcus Bank and their Fraud Department provide frivolous comments only to pacify me with empty apologies and statements in which they can not make true on. I am beyond frustrated about this matter. I can not go to a branch due to the lack of one, can not speak to an advanced supervisor, can not be contacted or contact the Review Department and it seems Marcus Bank does not care. It feels as if they are holding my monies intentionally. It bears the question- is their fraudulent activity being conducted within their own Department? How can Marcus Bank, a FDIC branch of Goldman Sacks, not be able to resolve this matter after this many attempts over this period of time? 

I truly hope CFPB can help or I will be forced to speak to someone at a News Outlet in hopes they would be able to get the attention of Marcus Bank. 

Please note the monies were left to me by my late father and it was instructed that the monies to be used for higher education. I XXXX this XXXX and intended to use this money to achieve a XXXX XXXX, the first in my family, and to continue to make my father proud.

According to my recent credit report, there are entries that I did not authorize and which I believe are in violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This is the 6 letter and dispute I have sent to the creditors along with my police report, FTC report, and supporting identity documents verifying my identity. I indicated in all my letters and police report that I am indeed a victim of identity theft, and this credit bureau and credit companies are violating my consumer rights and not protecting me as an American consumer according to the stated laws. This is my 6th notice to the bureau and the creditor companies notifying them that these listed accounts are fraud. My information isnt protected and this credit bureau or creditors are not honoring my identity theft claim. My 7th notice of litigation will be a lawsuit suing this credit bureau and all these creditors, these companies and credit bureau did not honor my rights or acknowledge my supporting documents regarding identity theft. I was incarcerated for 10 years with proof when all these accounts were open illegally and fraudulently and Ive proven this matter and will prove it in court without a doubt, Im going to sue for my rights being violated, pain and suffering, false allegations from creditors, and assisting to furnish wrong and fraudulent accounts. I demand all accounts and inquiries be removed as soon as possible.

Furthermore, 15 U.S. Code 1681c requires that consumer reporting agencies ensure the accuracy and privacy of consumer information. The unauthorized disclosure of my information not only violates this statute but also exposes me to potential identity theft and other forms of financial harm. 

I request that you take the following actions : 1. **Conduct an immediate investigation** : As required by 15 U.S. Code 1681i, I request that you investigate these unauthorized entries on my credit report. 
XXXX. **Remove the disputed entries** : If the investigation finds these entries were indeed unauthorized, they must be promptly removed from my credit report. 
XXXX. **Provide written confirmation** : Send me a written confirmation that the unauthorized entries have been removed from my credit report. 
XXXX. **Send an updated credit report** : Provide me with a current copy of my credit report to verify the corrections. 

Enclosed are copies of the relevant documents, including my recent credit report highlighting the disputed entries and any supporting documents that substantiate my claim. 

Please consider this letter as a formal complaint and take all necessary actions to resolve this matter within the 30-day timeframe stipulated by the FCRA. Failure to do so may result in further legal action to protect my rights.

I was charged {$16.00} in interest, which was bewildering since I always pay the last statement balance to avoid any interest. I have done this for over XXXX years. After advocating for myself, Capital One refunded me the interest charge of {$16.00} on XX/XX/year>. They reported it will take XXXX business days to show up on my account. 

The reason for this letter is to illustrate XXXX problems. 

I paid off my last statement balance of {$1000.00}, but somehow it changed after the cycle date to {$1100.00}. This is the first problem. The second problem is that the {$16.00} was calculated from a fictitious balance of {$700.00} and not {$90.00} ( the difference between what I paid and the mysterious new payoff of {$1100.00} ). Using their own calculation XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX per month or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX My actual published XXXX from Capital One is XXXX XXXX 

They literally calculated interest off a fictitious balance and changed my last statement balance to charge me {$16.00}.

2024-07-21,Debt or credit management,Debt settlement,Charged upfront or unexpected fees,,"I have been working with Beyond Finance since late XXXX. Four credit cards and two student loans were enrolled, and two of the credit cards have been completely settled. One credit card was scheduled to be settled this month ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and the other in XXXX, with the two loans to be settled in XX/XX/XXXX. Until last month, everything had gone according to schedule, though I was always mystified at the lack of communication on some important elements. 

In early XXXX, a large credit was issued to my account -- possibly because they were not able to negotiate a very favorable deal with the student loan people, and I had said that I thought they should give me a break on the settlement fee. Or not -- it was never explained, it just appeared. Several months ago, amounts were withdrawn from my account -- possibly because it was decided that the original credit was an error. Or not -- it also was never explained. 

This meant that the amount that I was paying into the account would be less than the amount needed by them to make payments to the creditors. Again -- this was not communicated to me, I worked it out for myself. Since then, I have called the company each month and the agent and I figured out ( with much difficulty! ) how much extra that I should deposit to cover the shortfall. So far, so good. 

In XXXX -- I believe it was the XXXX -- they sent a very puzzling ( to me ) communication about a settlement (? ) which I assumed to be an error, but I did call and spoke to an agent ; I believe it was on XX/XX/XXXX. She couldn't see any reason for my having received that message, but we worked out how much money needed to be deposited for XXXX, and I arranged to put in an extra {$250.00}. 

A week or so ago when I logged on to the Beyond website, there was a lot of confusing information about settlements that were in progress, and nothing available about the previous and future payments I was making on the remaining 4 accounts. Several calls to Beyond resulted in even more confusion, until the other day, the agent informed me that because there had not been enough funds in the account to cover one of the credit card payments, and because I had not responded within 15 days (!! I did!! ), that account had reverted to delinquency. For reasons that were not explained ( are we seeing a pattern here? ), two other accounts that were paid on time through XXXX also went back into "" Settlement negotiation ''. One account was not affected and seems to be continuing on its way to settlement ... at least for the moment. 

I was finally able to log on to the website that is used to track the actual payments ( the "" Dedicated Account '' page on Beyond 's website does not give any details on... much ), and discovered that in XXXX, Beyond had assessed another "" Settlement Fee '' which not only did I not know about, but apparently the agent that told me to deposit {$250.00} didn't know about either. That Settlement Fee was the reason that there were not enough funds to pay the one creditor. At no time was I ever contacted and asked for a specific amount that would have covered it -- if I had, I would have paid it! 

So now they seem ( I say "" seem '' because, again, no communication ) to be re-negotiating settlement agreements on 3 accounts, which look like they will come in at a higher level than what I have been paying. Also, I'm guessing that they will assess a "" Settlement Fee '' for each of the three accounts -- the one that was delinquent through no fault of mine, and the two that were not delinquent at all. Meanwhile it also seems that this whole situation is playing havoc with my credit rating. All this after almost 3 years of on-time payments, and good faith, proactive efforts to be sure the account remained in good standing.

There was no way I or anyone I know was using my gift card for those transactions. It was involved in a gift card scam! I contacted Vanilla gift cards and told them everything. Submitted a form that took months for them to review because they had an error in the dispute form that I had to repeated email and call them to fix. After FINALLY fixing my dispute form and submitting it, I received an email months later that they DENIED my dispute. They refused to put the STOLEN funds back on my Vanilla Visa Gift Card. Their response : "" Dear Cardholder, This letter is to inform you that we have completed our investigation regarding the referenced ticket above.

We take concerns from cardholders very seriously. After a thorough review of your account and evaluation of the evidence provided, we regret to inform you that we are unable to approve your dispute. With the denial of this dispute, your case has been closed.

2024-07-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XX/XX/XXXX From, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Email : XXXX Phone : XXXX To, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB Complaint Against : CMG Financial, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX Mortgage Loan # XXXX Description of the Issue : Inappropriate Credit Reporting that Ruined our Loan capability Due to auto-pay mishap, we ( husband and wife ) were reported 1X30 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and 1X 60 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX ) mortgage payment to credit bureaus by one of the 5 mortgage lenders namely CMG. This ruined our new purchase loan/refinance loan capability. We have 2 adjustable-rate mortgage loans and one of which adjusted this month to 8 % interest rate and we need to refinance this loan urgently. Both my husband and I currently have 5 mortgage loans and one auto ( XXXX ) loan on-going as our obligations and we have never ever been late for any of the other loans. We had several mortgage loans in the past that were paid-off/refinanced and none of them has ever been late ( See Attachment 3, pages 21-138 ). We also have several credits cards and none of them has any late payments ( See Attachment 3, pages 21-138 ). 

I am attaching my husband XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  statements covering the period XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, of the account that is used to make the mortgage payments to CMG ( Attachment 3, pages 9-20 ). You can see the payments went through for XXXX and XXXX and did not go through during XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX due to Autopay mishap. 

All XXXX missed payments + on-time XXXX payment were paid together on XX/XX/XXXX ( approx. $ XXXX ). You can see the balance in the account was ~ $ XXXX by the end of XXXX and increased to ~ $ XXXX by the end of XXXX. The account piled up on money from the direct deposit of his employment paychecks when the payments were not going through. His account balance is a proof that he doesnt have to stop the payment due to any financial burden. At that time, we both had a combined reserve of approx. $ XXXX ( See Attachment 3, pages 139-171 ). 

My husband did not cancel the Autopay. After the 3rd party credit monitoring agency alerted me of my lower credit score, it was when I alerted my husband and we reviewed everything and realized the missed payments. Immediately we swung into action and paid-up all missed payments altogether on XX/XX/XXXX ( approx. $ XXXX ). My husband was not well during the missed payments ' time and so he wasn't checking his bank account. Else, he would have noticed the money piling up and investigated. 

My husband immediately called CMG who promised to remove the late reporting from credit file and also promised to remove the late fees. They removed 1 late fee, but did not remove the other late fees. After that we did not hear anything from CMG. We then initiated email dispute with CMG ( Attachment 1 and 3 ). CMG suggested that we initiate dispute directly from credit bureaus and also submit a letter to CMG with our wet signature ( See Attachment 1, page 9 ). We complied to both. But CMG denied fixing the late reporting in response to both. 

Why did CMG give false promise on the phone? Why did CMG ask us to go in the laborious routes of dispute with credit bureaus and letter with wet signature if they knew they will eventually deny it? Attachment 1 has written proof of CMG asking us to submit letter with wet signature and to submit dispute with credit bureaus. We then filed complaint with XXXX  but CMG maintained its denial position ( See Attachment 2 ). 

CMG never got in touch with my husband or me ( both of us are on the loan ) to alert us on the missed payments. Our address changed, and lender 's portal doesn't display our contact details and doesn't have an option to add/update our contact details. If the mortgage portal doesnt have an option to update contact details, how are we to inform CMG of our address/phone change? If lender couldn't get in touch with my husband, they should have contacted me ( I am co-borrower ) as plan B. But they never contacted me. How is it fair that my credit is ruined without me knowing none of these events? Lender should be reaching out to borrowers when a payment is missed and not wait indefinitely and report to credit bureaus. This happened because the mortgage portal doesnt have option to update contact details. A low budget lender with low budget systems failed us? How is it fair? I request CFPB to intervene and help us by instructing CMG to remove the late payment reporting from our credit files.

My auto loan account number is # XXXX, and it was with consumer portfolio services inc. 

In XX/XX/2023, my car was declared a total loss due to an auto theft. My insurance company, XXXX XXXX, paid off the remaining balance of the loan in full. I received confirmation from both my insurance company and the lender that the payment was processed and the loan was settled. 

However, despite the loan being paid off, I have continued to receive billing statements from consumer portfolio services, indicating that I still owe money on the account. I have contacted the lender multiple times to resolve this issue, but they have failed to correct the account status and stop the billing. 

This ongoing issue has caused me considerable stress and has adversely affected my credit score, as the lender has reported these supposed missed payments to the credit bureaus. I believe this is an unfair and deceptive practice and is causing me undue financial harm. 

I am requesting the CFPBs assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that consumer portfolio services, corrects the status of my account to reflect that the loan was paid off by the insurance company in XX/XX/2023.

The XXXX charges totalling {$4200.00}. They were sent to a person that was in a treatment facility with no access to any devices that could make a transaction. During their time at the facility their account was hacked as well. I informed the chime agent of this when I filed the dispute. The next day, XX/XX/year>, chime sends me a email saying they found no error and my account would not credited. I immediately filed a Rebuttal. Today, XX/XX/year>, I called chimes dispute team around XXXX eastern time to request a email so I could upload a email from a merchant where my current chime debit card was used to make an unauthorized transaction by someone I do not know, never even heard of before. Around 12 hours later I check my account finding no credits has been issued even though they have had evidence proving my account was hacked. I called the dispute team around XXXX to ask if the email from the merchant with my card number and a stranger 's name was evidence that a error has occurred with my account, therefore only further proving that the XXXX charges were fraudulent just as I said. The dispute team Agent I just got off the phone with said the document I sent them at a little after XXXX today was proof a error has occurred with my account since the name on the account is not my name and my visa debit card issued by XXXX XXXX FDIC Insured was charged unauthorized. I asked the Agent since the Federal Law requires the financial institution to place the funds in a consumers account within one business day after a error has been proven & acknowledged by the financial institution if my account would be credited by XXXX tomorrow since that would be 24 hours after Chime got the evidence proving without a doubt that a recent charge was fraudulent. She informed that it was up to the investigation team and if any credits was going to be issued it would be by XX/XX/year>. She would make a note for the investigation team, that apparently has no phones or direct email for me to get in contact to actually see what is going on and why my account has not been credited already. I'm beyond infuriated with this situation. Chime Financial Inc Dispute Team Agent said YES a ERROR was made, yes my dispute was originally denied a few short hours after filing, YES the email I sent to them was evidence enough to show my account was used unauthorized, and then she said I DONT KNOW IF THE INVESTIGATION TEAM WILL CREDIT YOUR ACCOUNT! I KNOW MY RIGHTS AND CHIMES INVESTIGATION TEAM DOES NOT HAVE A CHOICE IN REGARDS TO PUTTING STOLEN FUNDS BACK INTO MY ACCOUNT. FEDERAL LAWS ARE NOT TO BE FOLLOWED ONLY BY THOSE WHO CHOOSE, THEY ARE TO BE FOLLOWED BY ALL! Now that the Chime Agent admitted to the error on my account originally at XXXX on XX/XX/year> and a different a chime Agent admitted she sees the same error around 12 hours later, at XXXX on XX/XX/year>, THAT is 2 separate chime dispute Team agents admitting errors on my account why is the rebuttal even open? If the evidence is proving the error them my account should have {$4200.00} placed as a temporary provisional credit to my account immediately if the investigation team needs more time to investigate, which I don't see why they would since they can fully investigate and deny a dispute within a few hours why can't they approve one in the same amount of time? It could not take much effort to read a email and press a few buttons. Regardless of what Chime Financial Inc and Stride Bank NA wants to do, the Federal Law and Regulation E along with my account being FDIC insured says my visa debit card has a zero fraud liability.

According to my recent credit report, there are entries that I did not authorize and which I believe are in violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This is the 6 letter and dispute I have sent to the creditors along with my police report, FTC report, and supporting identity documents verifying my identity. I indicated in all my letters and police report that I am indeed a victim of identity theft, and this credit bureau and credit companies are violating my consumer rights and not protecting me as an American consumer according to the stated laws. This is my 6th notice to the bureau and the creditor companies notifying them that these listed accounts are fraud. My information isnt protected and this credit bureau or creditors are not honoring my identity theft claim. My 7th notice of litigation will be a lawsuit suing this credit bureau and all these creditors, these companies and credit bureau did not honor my rights or acknowledge my supporting documents regarding identity theft. I was incarcerated for 10 years with proof when all these accounts were open illegally and fraudulently and Ive proven this matter and will prove it in court without a doubt, Im going to sue for my rights being violated, pain and suffering, false allegations from creditors, and assisting to furnish wrong and fraudulent accounts. I demand all accounts and inquiries be removed as soon as possible. 

Specifically, I refer to the following entries : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX {$37000.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX {$53000.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX {$500.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX {$1000.00} XXXX.

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX {$410.00} XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX {$970.00} XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Under the FCRA, 15 U.S. Code 1681b , consumer reporting agencies may furnish a consumer report only under specific circumstances, such as with the consumers written consent or in connection with a credit transaction initiated by the consumer. I did not provide my consent for the release or sharing of my personal information related to these accounts, nor did I initiate any credit transactions with the entities listed.

Furthermore, 15 U.S. Code 1681c requires that consumer reporting agencies ensure the accuracy and privacy of consumer information. The unauthorized disclosure of my information not only violates this statute but also exposes me to potential identity theft and other forms of financial harm.

I request that you take the following actions : 1. **Conduct an immediate investigation** : As required by 15 U.S. Code 1681i, I request that you investigate these unauthorized entries on my credit report.

2. **Remove the disputed entries** : If the investigation finds these entries were indeed unauthorized, they must be promptly removed from my credit report.

3. **Provide written confirmation** : Send me a written confirmation that the unauthorized entries have been removed from my credit report.

4. **Send an updated credit report** : Provide me with a current copy of my credit report to verify the corrections.

Enclosed are copies of the relevant documents, including my recent credit report highlighting the disputed entries and any supporting documents that substantiate my claim. 

Please consider this letter as a formal complaint and take all necessary actions to resolve this matter within the 30-day timeframe stipulated by the FCRA. Failure to do so may result in further legal action to protect my rights.

It had not been updated since XX/XX/XXXX. The error says that my creditors may have different information and I can't have access until it is fixed. 

I called Experian member services. The agent told me that it hasn't been updated because my creditors have not sent Experian any information. She recommended I call every company and ask them to send Experian my account information, which is ridiculous. 

She told me there is nothing that Experian can do to fix this. She was rude, raised her voice, and spoke over me. She further stated that I can not prove that my creditors are or are not submitting information to them without calling. 

I advised her that XXXX, my student loan company, reports to all 3 credit bureaus monthly. She then said that I haven't had student loans on my credit report since XXXX ; which can not be true since I have 4 years of payments to finish. 

I called back the following Monday and was transferred to another department. The man I spoke with says there was nothing wrong with my report and wanted to transfer me back to member services. When I asked for someone above him to help make sense of this issue, he hung up on me. 

I have been denied credit line increases because when the company attempted to pull my Experian account, they were told there was no credit file available.

2024-07-21,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","Im writing to express my deep disappointment in Rushmore Loan Management, Rushmore Servicing and Mr. Cooper. Allow me to explain...

When my loan was held by Rushmore Loan Management, I was asked to provide a copy of the XXXX policy ( see attachments ). I provided evidence of this, but then was notified that they purchased an XXXX  policy for me and included it in the escrow. I was unaware of this until the loan was transferred to Rushmore Servicing. At that time, Rushmore Servicing continued to escrow for the XXXX  policy knowing the policy was covered under my HOA ( XXXX XXXX ) since the inception of the loan in XXXX XXXX. 

I have spoken to several Rushmore Servicing agents, escrow department, insurance department and loss mitigation department over the year to update my policy, but unfortunately, that has not occurred. This issue has now cost me {$2000.00} to bring my loan up to date and escape foreclosure scheduled on XX/XX/XXXX. I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX of {$2000.00} and hope to rectify the problem by recovering the overcharged amount for an XXXX policy from XXXX XXXX to today. My loan payment was {$490.00}, but since Rushmore Servicing was charging me for XXXX insurance, the loan payment increased to {$580.00} for the period of time in question. I understand that Rushmore Loan Management is no longer in existence and transferred all loans to Rushmore Servicing ; therefore, I can not contact Rushmore Loan Management directly. I was also information that my XX/XX/XXXX payment was not received which isn't correct ( see payments attached below ).",,Mr. Cooper Group Inc.,PA,15108,,Consent provided,Web,2024-07-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9574900

I have been using the exact same device ( my mobile phone ) and accessed the account using the same network at my house which I have been using prior to XX/XX/year>. I still continued to be asked a one time pin even after successful authentication. 

I had to login multiple times on my mobile app on XX/XX/year> since my transaction using a Virtual card tied to an account reported for fraud was getting rejected. I was also working with one of the agents to resolve the issue. After a few attempts my request for getting a One time pin on the mobile app was blocked with a message that I have exceeded the number of attempts to get a One time pin for the day. I was prompted to wait for 24 hours to get a PIN. This meant all my access to my accounts from the Capital one app was blocked. I have 2 Credit card accounts, 1 Savings account and 2 CDs with Capital One. I wouldn't have access to these accounts for more than 24 hours. I called their customer service. Some of the agents didn't show any empathy and just replied that I need to wait for 24 hours. This seemed a bit scary me not having visibility into my financials on a weekend for 24 hours.

One of the agents suggested I access the account through a browser instead of the app. Again this required me to authenticate on the mobile app. I was finally able to login to my account from a browser after verifying on my mobile app. I felt this ridiculous since my account access was blocked from my mobile app but I could use the app to authenticate and access my account on a browser. Every agent I spoke to mentioned that these are security features taken to protect my account. I found this more of an inconvenience for the customer. Also how could this be protection if the mobile app was used to authenticate me to access my account from a browser. 

It has been close to 24 hours since I accessed my account from my mobile app. This has caused a lot of inconvenience for me performing some of the financial updates during the weekend.

I as the owner of the account 1. Never requested the bank to setup a One time PIN always to access my account.

2. Was never told that there would be a "" THRESHOLD '' on the number of times I can access my account from the mobile app since this was tied to the number of one time pins I can generate in a day.

I even stated at the very beginning of my original XXXX complaint that I was making partial payments to keep the account alive for Synchronys benefit ( CFPB : Please see attached ).

Where they accused me of making things up with my imagination, which carelessly contradicted part of Synchronys explanation they had already filed about my account being locked on case number XXXX, while XXXX & XXXX claimed things I NEVER said! ) The only slander, if any, I see throughout this entire case are the routinely dishonest and instigative responses provided by XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.

All of the frustration and confusion on this specific part of the complaint is the fault of YOU ( XXXX & XXXX and Synchrony ) and only YOU! I have never heard of a situation where theres a client ( the bank ), an attorney representing client ( XXXX & XXXX ), the attorney files major legal cases on behalf of the client, but then the client and the attorney make a pointed effort to have NOOO coordination between each other whatsoever. You know guys, a little bit of friendliness and communication between your two organizations could have cleared up that other Why was my account getting locked out in XXXX? question months ago. I tried to file that question directly to Paypal on case number XXXX ( since the Account Locked emails came from Paypals system ), but they rejected it without actually saying anything, and CFPB forwarded it to Synchrony. Synchrony took 60 days to come back with a long-winded response about my written identity form being declined ( WHICH WASNT EVEN THE THING I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT IN CASE NUMBERS XXXX AND XXXX ) and then their response barely addressed the e-mails I got from Paypal saying my account was locked due to unusual activity ( thats the thing I WAS trying to figure out in those two complaints! ) XXXX XXXX also states in his most recent CFPB communication regarding the more recent, NOT DUPLICATE complaints : Synchrony has responded. XXXX & XXXX has responded. Well, please just refer to the attached screenshot of my current CFPB dashboard, which disproves half of that statement. SYNCHRONY HAS NOT RESPONDED to about five different new complaints so far. In fact, they keep telling the CFPB they need more time before they CAN respond! Again, we see an example of XXXX XXXX being an unapologetic, wildly hypocritical XXXX through a Federal reporting system, where hes filing patented false responses in a cheap rush to crush me like a bug ( when HIS company is the one who is unjustly attacking ME! ), while avoiding any legal integrity or responsibility on his side. But what else is new?! Also in the process of his XXXX response, XXXX XXXX AGAIN completely refused to address my question : XXXX XXXX letter were you talking about in XXXX? ( To CFPB and Synchrony : The reason I keep making a case about this right now is because I cant find any evidence on my side that I sent XXXX & XXXX a written request not to call me prior to XXXX. But I DID have such requests in place for other creditors, and some of those other creditors were violating their request within a matter of weeks when XXXX & XXXX popped out with their ambush lawsuit last year. Im dealing with a big powerful bully forcing me into a corner, where I have to wonder if theres some kind of illicit connection between XXXX & XXXX strange timing last year and the other creditors, too! Im attaching another CFPB case from last year just to illustrate ONE example of this happening. ) XXXX & XXXX is going to keep treating me like total junk with no consumer rights whatsoever, and I dont even understand why, other than just because I have debt. Whatever advice XXXX XXXX is getting from the CFPB, this advice is clearly skewed by the fact hes not giving an honest account of his actions to the CFPB. AS IT SPECIFICALLY PERTAINS TO IDENTITY THEFT : Was I victimized by identity theft in XXXX and XXXX that was perfectly and eerily timed just before XXXX XXXX XXXX legal attacks? Yes, that REALLY happened, and thats why I was in a wild XXXX XXXX all last year! ( CFPB and Synchrony : You can review the case Ive attached from XXXX Bank proving two of the three instances where this happened, and the company where the fraudulent accounts were opened apologized. XXXX & XXXX : Youre in XXXX XXXX and youre refusing to apply your brains to anything Im saying, so I dont really care what you do with this information. The third instance of this identity was someone opening an online checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, just before XXXX & XXXX mailed their lawsuit in XXXX. In the months before XXXX & XXXX ever popped out with their lawsuit, I was honestly already thinking : Okay. Is this a family member acting up again, or is this a creditor somewhere trying to verify my credit line in a really slimy way? That was last year. But this year, after the past several rounds through the CFPB, Ive come up with a third theory : Was this some kind of whistleblower who knew XXXX & XXXX was about to commit their garbage legal attack and they were trying to draw attention? Maybe its one of those three possibilities. Maybe its none of those three! I honestly dont know, and it sickens me every day Im not allowed to figure it out! BUT COMPLETELY IGNORING THE IDENTITY THEFT, heres the other problem : I didnt even mention the unnerving identity theft being part of XXXX XXXX XXXX  hostile actions when I wrote XXXX two weeks ago. What that complaint is addressing is XXXX XXXX XXXX general manipulation and abusiveness through this legal case and through the CFPB system, and their constant question-dodging. So why is XXXX XXXX response to XXXX once AGAIN trying to divert the issue to be all about my written identity theft form, when thats not even what I was talking about?! And then, XXXX XXXX ended his response in this most recent report by unofficially, indirectly admitting hes just going to keep marking everything Im saying as duplicates so he doesnt have to deal with it. Thats wonderful! Thats exactly the honest and helpful attitude I was already anticipating from you, but its nice to see written confirmation. At least I wont be stressing out even more from reading your XXXX  dismissive CFPB responses. And as long as Im not reading those, I wont need to fill out more CFPB reports with new examples showing the blatantly obvious : XXXX & XXXX is, and has always been, completely full of it!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,PA,159XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-07-23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9573487

In XXXX XXXX the taxes are tripled when a home is processed as an investment property. However, once you obtain residency, the loan is adjusted to reflect the taxes for a primary residence. 

So, the week of XXXX XXXX, after the closing, I obtained my XXXX XXXX  driver 's license, I updated my license plates and my car registration and insurance were switched to XXXX XXXX. It wasn't until XXXX XXXX XXXX  that the XXXXXXXX XXXX Assessor 's office approved my application for primary residency. Normally, the mortgage lender would take this information and quickly and promptly readjust the tax rates on the loan to reflect the change in residency. This is has not been the case almost two months later! 

I contacted XXXX at the end of XXXX to process this change for my mortage payment because it will reduce my payment by about {$470.00}, along with whatever the new escrow adjustment will be! This is a hefty overage that I have to pay! XXXX said my bank switched to Specialized Loan Servicing ( I did not sign off on any contracts or documents to SLS ). So, my bank lender, XXXX XXXX / XXXX XXXX, and I contacted SLS on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. They instructed us to send over the residency approval and tax adjusted rate, uploading the documents to XXXX. We did and the woman said it would take 10 days to process, so we said we'd call back in 10 business days.

I called SLS back on XX/XX/XXXX and they said my loan had just transferred from SLS to shellpoint/new rez, again ... without me signing any agreement or contract... and they can't access my information in the computer to check status of my documents until the loan transfers. This was a Friday and I said I'd call on Monday. I called back SLS on Monday and my loan had transferred, but the rep said there's nothing in the computer. I argued how that's possible in 2024 that documents are not carried over! This loan was in the process of being adjusted and now, all traces are wiped from the system?? And we have to start the process over?? I told the woman I want a supervisor or manager to call me, and no one did! 

My bank lender, XXXX, and I conferenced called SLS AGAIN on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX to get this resolved. The gentleman instructed us to send an email with the same documents we already uploaded on XXXX to which he said their company doesn't use/their computer doesn't recognize. He also said to call back in two business days to check status. Today is Sunday, the XXXX. My lender was unable on Thursday and Friday of last week for us to call back again. I want this mortgage adjusted before my XXXX payment AND I want a refund for the overage for my XXXX mortgage because this should have been processed!! My lender said she has never seen this process take THIS LONG or anyone have this much trouble getting it straightened out, ESPECIALLY in this state where it is a requirement!! 

We are planning to call tomorrow! However, I went on XXXX to check out New Rez/Shellpoint and came across comments of people going through the same situation with this company extorting money from lenders! One individual commented and said "" New Rez is part of SLS, which is a 3rd party collection agency, which is illegal! They get away with criminal activity by merging with new rez shellpoint so they can extort money from you. If you never signed a purchase of agreement to pay a debt, it is illegal on their part! It is identity theft and ask then to show you where you signed this purchased and if they are licensed in your state. They are nothing but criminals, and third party with no legal right to receive extorted money. '' He goes on to say that SLS is a collection agency and they break the law all the time selling and buying mortgages as a third party without you signing a contract with them. 

How is this allowed??? My loan was processed through XXXX XXXX!!

The initial one is legitimately what I authorize them to make in order to pay for my trip but I do not authorize them to place another hold on my account, besides. The second is illegal because it is not authorized by me. The bank I use simply accespts those holds, but it is clearly wrong. The second is that XXXX is a technology-based service and one would expect their holds to last no more than a day after the completion of a trip. On average the holds last 4 days and nothing justifies this reckless conduct. Besides, the holds I authorize which are legitimate XXXX may place other holds days after the trip was concluded and they do not care to explain why. Every time, I have complained they have no customer service personnel answering questions so their website requests me to send the documentation accompanying the complaint. Sad story is that they never revert to me to fix the problem. I have come to understand from other users of both XXXX and XXXX that this is the way these two companies do business here in the United States. XXXX does not do that in that countries and it is not even standard practice in other countries where the rideshare services exist. 

There is also an unfair business activity XXXX and XXXX engage in. If a rider is not immediately available to ride when the driver arrives, after 5 minutes the driver can cancel the trip and charge the rider anything between {$3.00} and {$10.00}. Similarly XXXX levies extra charges after 2 minutes of a driver arriving at a pick up. Their drivers delay riders all the time, but there is never any compensation for our lost time. If it is good for them to charge riders for missing rides and or delaying the pick ups, it must be equally good for them to compensate riders when their drivers routinely cancel trips. 

The net effect of this conduct on poor people like me is that XXXX places more holds than they should on my money thus denying me access to my money for days on end. This conduct is wrong if not criminal. This needs to be thoroughly investigated, and they must be punished. My complaint is about conduct that is wrong and the majority of these rideshare companies have now gotten used to the illegal treatment. For the avoidance of doubt, there is not a single way to justify their system not completing their trips like they used to do with all the necessary charges calculated at the end of a trip.

I perform exceptionally. 
This is an unfair and abusive practice. In addition, I called the bank and the agent said they can not tell me why my credit card was closed.

Despite my diligent efforts to ensure that I received all necessary notifications from Bank of America, I did not receive any alerts notify regarding these unauthorized activities on my account. 

At the time of the transactions in question, Bank of America failed to notify me as agreed upon. This lack of communication directly contradicts the protections and services that Bank of America is obligated to provide its customers. Furthermore, Bank of America was not authorized to send out replacement cards on my behalf, which directly contributed to the unauthorized activities on my account over the past ten months. Additionally, I have been charged twice, sometimes even three times, for transactions that I did not authorize or make. 

I was only notified about the unauthorized fraudulent activity in XXXX when I received a letter stating the issue. This activity should have been spotted years ago if Bank of America was providing the services that offered to me at the beginning of account being opened Due to these failures and the resulting financial loss, I am requesting an immediate investigation into these unauthorized transactions and a full reimbursement of the disputed amounts.
