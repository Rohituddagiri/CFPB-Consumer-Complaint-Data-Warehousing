These derogatory marks have significantly impacted my credit score, and I believe they are being reported erroneously.

Details of the Inaccuracies : 1. Incorrect Payment Status : Several accounts are being reported as late or in collections, even though I have made payments or resolved disputes. These include : XXXX XXXX ( Experian and XXXX ) Reported as 90 days late despite payments being made. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Experian and XXXX ) Reported as late 120 days, though this account should not have been marked delinquent due to resolved payments.

2. Charge-Offs for Paid or Resolved Accounts : The following accounts are listed as charge-offs, but I have either paid them off or reached settlement agreements that should have updated their statuses : XXXX XXXX  ( Experian and XXXX ) Charge-off status persists despite payments made. 
XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Experian and XXXX ) Multiple accounts still marked as charged off after disputes were resolved. 
XXXX XXXX and XXXX ( Experian and XXXX ) These accounts were charged off but should reflect resolved balances due to settlements made.

3. Inaccurate Balances : Some revolving accounts are showing high balances that are outdated or incorrect. This includes : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Experian and XXXX ) Reported balances remain high despite recent payments. 
XXXX  XXXX ( Experian and XXXX ) The balance on this account is also outdated and does not reflect current payments.

4. Disputes Not Properly Resolved : Several accounts reflect disputes that were supposedly resolved, but the resolution has not been satisfactory, and the derogatory marks remain : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Experian and XXXX ) The account was marked as a charge-off despite a resolution of my dispute. 
XXXX XXXX ( Experian and XXXX ) The account is listed as a resolved dispute, though I disagree with the outcome, and the derogatory mark is incorrect.

5. Duplicate or Repetitive Accounts : XXXX is reporting duplicate entries for the following accounts, which unfairly impacts my credit score : XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Multiple listings for the same account appear on my XXXX report. 
XXXX XXXX  The same account is reported more than once, and the duplicate entry contributes to an incorrect number of derogatory accounts.

6. Outdated Information : Some accounts, such as XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, appear to have been listed as derogatory for an extended period, longer than the statutory XXXX years for charge-offs and collections. These outdated entries should be removed. 

Derogatory Account Breakdown : Experian XXXX Derogatory Accounts : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Harm Caused : The presence of these erroneous derogatory accounts has : Severely impacted my credit score, limiting my ability to obtain credit at reasonable terms. 
Caused undue financial stress by misrepresenting my creditworthiness to potential lenders. 
Affected my ability to secure housing and favorable credit terms.

Resolution Sought : I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate the inaccuracies and require Experian and XXXX to : 1. Remove all inaccurate derogatory marks from my credit reports.

2. Correct the reporting of balances on revolving credit accounts.

3. Update the status of accounts that have been paid, resolved, or disputed.

4. Remove duplicate and outdated derogatory entries from my reports.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"COMES NOW, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Living, Breathing, Sentient Man bring forth this claim against Navy Federal Credit Union ( `` NFCU '' ) for violations of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( "" FCRA '' ), specifically pertaining to the furnishing of false, inaccurate, and misleading information on my consumer report. 

1. Violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( 7 ) ( A ) : Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information to Consumer Reporting Agencies NFCU has failed to adhere to its responsibilities as a furnisher of information. Under 1681s2 ( 7 ) ( A ), furnishers are required to provide accurate information to consumer reporting agencies. I have identified multiple instances where NFCU reported incorrect information regarding my credit account, which has adversely affected my credit score and caused me significant distress. 

2. Violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681c ( 5 ) : Requirements Relating to Information Contained in Consumer Reports NFCU has also contravened 1681c ( 5 ), which mandates that information regarding accounts in collection must be reported accurately. Notably, NFCU charged off my account but failed to provide me with a copy of the Form 1099-C, which is necessary for my tax filings. According to the Internal Revenue Service, a charged-off amount is considered taxable income that should be reported on my 1040 tax return, not on a consumer report. This misreporting further misrepresents my financial status and creditworthiness. 

3. Violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) : Compliance Procedures Under 1681e ( b ), NFCU is obligated to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information it furnishes. The false and misleading information provided in my report indicates a lack of such procedures, resulting in a significant breach of the FCRA. 

4. Violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681n : Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance NFCUs actions constitute willful noncompliance with the FCRA, as they knowingly and willingly reported inaccurate information regarding my account status. Under 1681n, I am entitled to seek civil liability for these violations, which have caused me both financial harm and emotional distress. 

Supporting Case Law Additionally, in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), the court found that a data furnisher can be held liable for reporting inaccurate information if it fails to conduct a reasonable investigation after receiving a consumer dispute, reinforcing the obligations of furnishers under the FCRA. 

Furthermore, in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX ), the court emphasized that data furnishers must be proactive in ensuring the accuracy of the information they report, highlighting the legal expectation for compliance with the FCRA. 

In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), the Supreme Court underscored the necessity for accuracy in credit reporting and the implications of inaccuracies on consumer rights. The court emphasized that consumers must be protected from the repercussions of erroneous information, as such inaccuracies can severely impact their ability to obtain credit. 

Lastly, in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), the court ruled that furnishers of information have a duty to ensure that the information they provide is accurate and that consumers have the right to seek redress when this duty is not fulfilled.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,NJ,08094,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10517537

2024-10-20,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I started using this credit account from PayPal this year in XXXX. They gave me six months of no interest.

However, I noticed they did charge me XXXX dollars of interest in my second month of having an account. I paid {$100.00} roughly {$100.00} a month toward my balance but by the time my six months came around I still had a balance of over {$400.00}. Because of this high balance, I was not able to fully pay it off in one payment so they started to charge me a very high amount of interest. I noticed they also would charge me a late fee if my posted payment was a day late which I called about and they reversed XXXX of them but with the interest and the other late fees, they did not reverse. My balance is {$220.00} of interest and late fees and I owe a total of {$300.00} roughly. So I really only owe them {$79.00} And I can definitely pay that off, the XXXX $ is a very high balance. I asked if they would remove any of the other fees and they some agents said they would not that it was applied just fine. A lot of the customer service people Ive spoken to over chat had a rude sentiment with me. I didnt feel like they were really trying to help me. It sounded more like they were accusing me of not wanting to pay at all and trying to get over on them and just being a bad customer just were very rude. 

I did not have a good experience with the customer service and they refused to help me and wanted to cut off my conversation shirt. I did, however, speak to two agents over chat who offered to take off all of my interest and my late fees so I could pay the balance, and unfortunately, my browser would refresh when they asked me how I could pay and they were asking me to pay through the chat. 
When I tried to reconnect, mysteriously I was given a new agent and that person said they can see that although I was given an interest and late fee refund offer they would refuse and didnt say exactly why. They just said it was not possible. With the other two agents, it was possible so I am very confused. Id like to know exactly why I was offered this with two agents and then never again offered with any other agents. And what that meant exactly that I could pay them through the chat. For some reason, no one knows what or why that was offered to me and can not answer these questions. Or they refuse to answer these questions.

This is very Misleading and a bit deceitful. And predatory in my opinion. I would like to pay off my balance and take the offer that the two agents offered me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,CA,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-13,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10515424

This has led to unlawful collection practices. I demand restitution of the principal and interest collected and request that monthly payments be made directly to me as compensation. Should Capital One fail to comply with this demand, I will pursue arbitration based on our agreement and relevant legal protections.

1. Securitization of Debt and Improper Collections According to Capital Ones financial disclosures ( see Exhibit A ), the debt tied to my account was likely securitized and sold to investors. Once securitized, Capital One relinquished its right to collect payments directly from me, as ownership of the debt was transferred. However, Capital One has continued to collect payments from me despite no longer holding the debt. This action is in violation of the Holder in Due Course Rule and constitutes unjust enrichment, as Capital One has already been compensated through the securitization process. 
Based on Capital Ones 10-K filings, the company has profited substantially from the securitization of consumer debts, generating significant capital through these transactions. This profit was earned while Capital One continues to unlawfully collect direct payments from consumers like myself, which is not only unjust but also violates principles of fair debt collection and transparency.

In Heritage Bank v. Bruha, it was established that collecting payments on a debt that has been sold or securitized amounts to unjust enrichment, as the creditor can no longer collect from the consumer. Capital Ones continued collection efforts have caused financial harm, and I demand restitution of these payments.

2. Restitution of Principal and Interest As the account holder and holder in due course, I am entitled to the full restitution of all principal and interest collected unlawfully. Under the precedents set in Cain v. Midland Funding, LLC, any interest and principal collected on a securitized debt must be returned to the consumer. Capital Ones actions have caused undue financial strain, and I demand that all principal and interest be refunded immediately.

3. Monthly Payments in Accordance with Legal Rights Under established principles of equitable restitution and unjust enrichment, I am exercising my right to demand that monthly payments be made to me to compensate for the improper handling of this debt. Since the debt has been securitized and Capital One continues to unlawfully profit, I demand monthly payments equivalent to the amount unlawfully collected until this matter is fully resolved.

4. Holder in Due Course Rule As the holder in due course, I retain the right to assert defenses against Capital Ones unlawful collection efforts. Capital One has failed to provide full disclosure regarding the securitization of my debt, and under the Holder in Due Course Rule ( 16 CFR Part 433 ), I am protected from further collection efforts. I am formally exercising my right under this rule to demand the cessation of any further collection attempts.

5. Account Closure and Unjust Actions Capital Ones decision to close my account without proper notice or correction of the billing errors constitutes a violation of consumer protection laws. Precedents set in Krieger v. Bank of America show that such actions by a creditor without rectifying billing errors or informing the consumer about the securitization of debt violate the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ). I demand that the account be reinstated, and that billing errors be rectified immediately, along with restitution of any wrongful charges.

6. Arbitration Notice In accordance with applicable laws and our agreement, I am notifying Capital One that should this issue not be resolved promptly, I will pursue arbitration as a means of resolving this dispute. Both federal and state laws governing debt collection and arbitration provide for a fair and binding resolution process. I am entitled to seek redress for the financial harm caused by Capital Ones actions, and I fully intend to pursue my legal rights through arbitration if this matter is not addressed within the specified time.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,IL,60617,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10514712

Even though I had three customer service agents say it was. And so me being a beneficiary of the account that was used means that they are wanting the fiduciary, and my dad is the fiduciary of the account that I have been using to make my deposits it is my first bank account I used XXXX XXXX once because my host home provider was willing to help me out in the time of need because I needed to get out of a sticky situation and my fiduciary was leaving to go on a trip to XXXX which is where they are now. And so that was that and now they're making it to wear apparently they can't close my account I can't open another account I can't make a payment I can't do anything with my account whatsoever nor am I seeing proper account balance that I need to pay off the point where I don't know exactly what to do I don't want this to cause my credit report to go down especially cuz I just this is my first credit card and I don't want it to negatively affect my credit report I don't want to have a bad banking history that might or might not affect future bank accounts that I might have and overall I just I'm needing to either come my account closed or have it reopened so that I can actually also pay my bills pay the outstanding balance and actually be able to function as a human being cuz I use that for gas I use that for work I use that for everything and with it being restricted I have no access to groceries gas food Lord asked anything and they are basically making me feel like they're giving me the runaround cuz I'm a new member cuz I've gone on and researched that Capital One can close your account, but the company itself has to do it I can't do it from my end ... and so overall there's no legitimate reason for this whole situation that I'm currently in now and I really would rather not just sit by and wait for a miracle to happen or for them to come to their senses or actually follow through with them saying they are going to send me important information and whatnot or mail me information that hasn't happened yet ... and I honestly don't think they're actually going to send me mail me or even really do anything to help rectify the situation",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CO,80016,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10509550
2024-10-20,Debt collection,Payday loan debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I received a fraudulent scam letter in the mail on XX/XX/year> which I initially noticed that the envelope post marked from XXXX, OR and when I took the letter out it said that the letter was from the "" law office '' of Quest Legal Group which is their office is located in XXXX XXXX, CA. As I started reading the letter it said that they represent a pay day loan company called XXXX which then I XXXX the company XXXX and I read that XXXX is owned by a pawn broker called XXXX XXXX so I started thinking that this is part of a scam but regardless the letter continued on saying that I had until XXXX XXXX to pay off the debt owed to XXXX in the amount of {$1500.00}. The other part of the notice which is strange is that it says it says that that the loan was taken out while I was working for a company called XXXX XXXX so now there is another company that is involved in this scam. The worrisome part of the letter is that they print family member 's names on the letter where they say that they will subpoena your family members and take them to court as well to testify against and also that they will call XXXX to damage your credit score which they actually print a fake credit score at the bottom of the letter so all this is from the first letter I received on XXXX XXXX. 
The second notice I received in the mail from Quest Legal Group which this one was actually post marked from California I received on XX/XX/year> which said the exact thing as the first notice except that the amount decreased to to {$490.00} instead of the {$1500.00} that they were demanding from the first notice. The notice said that they were going to be nice with me and help settle the debt as long as I pay them the {$490.00} by XXXX XXXX and if they did receive the payment then they would purse on taking me to court. 
Obviously I have never even heard anything or seen any of these companies or even worked at any of these companies in my life until i received this fraudulent scam letter from Quest Legal Group. I started doing some research online and I have read other warning notices from other victims that say that they too have received the same weird fraudulent scam letter from XXXX or from Quest Legal Group and in all the letters it says that they need to pay them the money that the victim supposedly took out with XXXX if not that they will be taken to court and legal action will be obtained. The other victims of this scam also say that they have never heard of Quest Legal Group or XXXX until they opened the scam letter that they received in the mail. I even read a complaint on XXXX  about another victim that received a notice from XXXX so I ; m not sure if all this scam companies are working together to create this fraudulent scam or could just be 1 person using all these companies including the law office of quest Legal Group to create this scam. 
I did check with XXXX representative to see if someone might have used my information to take out a pay day loan using my personal information but the XXXX representative guaranteed me that there is no activity on my credit report from any company called XXXX or XXXX XXXX or any from any debt collectors under the name Quest Legal Group so then raises the question where are these scammers getting people 's information tocreate these fake debts which are obviously fraudulent scams",,Quest Legal Group,FL,33434,,Consent provided,Web,2025-01-29,Untimely response,No,,10509093

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Formal Request for Removal of Nonpublic Information and Violation Notice For Account Number XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX, This is my final notice to formally request the removal of my nonpublic and transaction history to be deleted from Experian, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, also know as credit reporting agencies immediately. I am enforcing my consumer rights and privacy to what can and can not be shared with non affiated third parties. Any rights that was inserted into the terms of the credit card agreement at time of application, I am revoking any and all permissions to share anything about me and my experience with your financial institution.

Below is why I am requesting all of my transaction history to be deleted : 1. As a financial institution you must provide an initial notice to each customer explaining their privacy policies and practices regarding nonpublic personal information when the account was initially established and annually.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

3. As a financial institution you have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of your customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of our nonpublic personal information. You have not done that and have share my information to various non affilates.

4. As a financial institution you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ( credit reporting agencies ) any nonpublic personal information without my written consent.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies.

6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim. There are numerous laws that states I have the right to opt out and you must comply or be in violation of {$1000.00} per incedent. I am giving you 4 days to consult with your legal team to verify everything I have stated and to delete all of my nonpubic, transaction history from all CRAs immediately. If you fail to comply, I am ready to take legal actions. Please verify with your legal team, under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions can face substantial fines for each instance of non-compliant disclosure after you have been advised to stop numerous times. The amounts could potentially reach up to {$100000.00} per violation. As a consumer whose private information is being disclosed without consent may be able to sue the financial institution for damages, including compensation for emotional distress and legal fees. Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance. 

I trust you will take this matter seriously and resolve the issue promptly. Please provide written confirmation that my transaction history has been removed from Experian, XXXX and XXXX XXXX immediately. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

Under 15 USC 1681 ( e ) ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are legally required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in their reports. This has clearly not been done in my case, and the errors remain unaddressed.

Under 15 USC 1681i ( 5 ), it is the agencys responsibility to promptly delete or correct any information found to be inaccurate and incomplete during a dispute. Despite this legal requirement, the inaccuracies continue to persist on my report, causing unnecessary hardship.

Under 15 USC 1681s-2 explicitly states that furnishers must not report information they know, or have reasonable cause to believe, is inaccurate. These accounts have been reported in violation of this law.

XXXX, Experian, and XXXX are consumer reporting agencies bound by these principles. As a consumer, I am entitled to ensure my private information is safeguarded, supported by 15 U.S.C. 6801, which obligates financial institutions to protect customers ' nonpublic personal information. 

15 U.S.C. 1681, section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ), states that consumer reporting agencies can only furnish a consumer report with the consumer 's written instructions. Neither XXXX, Experian, XXXX, nor any financial institution providing information to these credit agencies has my explicit written consent to share my information. Therefore, any previous consent, whether verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or otherwise, is hereby revoked. 

15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ) ( c ) mandates that financial institutions can not disclose nonpublic personal information to third parties without giving consumers the option to opt out. I was not informed of my right to opt out by any information furnishers. Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) prohibits consumer reporting agencies from including adverse information older than seven years in a consumer report, except for criminal convictions. The adverse item reported on my account without my consent violates this regulation. 

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ) prohibits furnishing information to a consumer reporting agency if it is known or believed to be inaccurate. Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 1681e requires consumer reporting agencies to maintain reasonable procedures to avoid violations of section 1681c and limit the furnishing of consumer reports to permissible purposes.

Furthermore, I am requesting proof of any previous investigations conducted regarding my complaints. I would like to know the methods used in these investigations and request all records of communication with the lenders involved, including : 1.The contact information of the lenders ( name, address, and phone number ).

2.Documentation that substantiates any claims regarding late payments on my accounts.

Please provide this information within 10 days. If you are unable to furnish the requested documentation in this timeframe, I ask that my account be updated to reflect a status of PAID/LATE. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Upon reviewing my credit report, I identified several inaccuracies related to my XXXX XXXX account ( Account Number : XXXX ), including errors in the reported credit limit, last payment date, term length, late payment activity, and date of the last report. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), consumer reporting agencies are legally obligated to maintain accurate and complete information. These errors are in violation of this obligation, and they have the potential to misrepresent my financial standing.

Under the authority of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which mandates that consumer reporting agencies must ensure the maximum possible accuracy of reported information, I am writing to formally dispute the inaccuracies related to my XXXX XXXX account ( Account Number : XXXX ). The errors include incorrect reporting of the credit limit, last payment date, term length, late payment activity, and date reported.

As required by law, I am requesting that these inaccuracies be thoroughly investigated and corrected. Due to the nature of these violations, I am requesting that this account be completely removed from my credit reports across all three major bureaus within 15 days. Failure to rectify this promptly may result in further legal action to enforce my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Upon checking my personal EXPERIAN account, I realized that I have incorrect information in my credit report. The accounts are : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. There is a record of late payments and that is not correct. 

According to consumer protection, EXPERIAN is violating the following laws : 1. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 and 15 U.S. Code 1681i.

2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

5. It should be noted that the dates on which the alleged late payments are being reported coincide with the date on which the covid-19 pandemic began, violating a very important law which is the ''The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act ( 2020 ) '' The dates on which the incorrect late payments appear are described in each account as follows : Account # XXXX dates : XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>. 

Account # XXXX, date : XX/XX/year>. 

Account # XXXX, dates : XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>. 

Account # XXXX, dates : XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>. 

EXPERIAN must respect consumer protection laws and assume its responsibility to take care of citizens and not take advantage of wanting to benefit from inaccurate information.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Subject : Violation of 605B Rule and Unlawful Reinsertion of Fraudulent Accounts Without Notification Issue Summary : I am filing this complaint against Experian for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) specifically related to the unlawful reinsertion of fraudulent accounts into my credit report without proper notification. Details of the Complaint : Two fraudulent accounts were previously removed from m
y credit report after I filed an identity theft dispute under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( 605B ). However, these accounts have since been reinserted into my credit report without notification, which violates 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( ii ). I never received written or electronic notice of the reinsertion within XXXX business days, as required by law. The fraudulent accounts are : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Acct XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Acct XXXX XXXX These accounts were initially removed due to identity theft, and their reappearance on my credit report without notice constitutes a serious violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA. Additionally, the accounts have been reinserted as charge-offs, which is also unlawful because charge-offs representing income are prohibited from being reported on my credit report under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ).

Relevant Legal Requirements : Certification Requirement : The FCRA requires the furnisher of the information to certify that it is accurate and complete before it can be reinserted.

Notification Requirement : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must notify me within XXXX business days of the reinsertion, including the name, address, and phone number of the information furnisher.

To date, Experian has failed to meet these legal requirements.

Supporting Case Law : Cushman v. Trans Union Corp., 115 F.3d 220 ( 3rd Cir. 1997 ) Credit reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure accuracy.

Dennis v. BEH-1, LLC, 520 F.3d 1066 ( 9th Cir. 2008 ) CRAs are required to notify consumers when information is reinserted.

Pinner v. Schmidt, 805 F.2d 1258 ( 5th Cir. 1986 ) Failure to properly notify consumers of reinsertion violates their rights.

Desired Resolution : I request the following actions from Experian : Immediate removal of the fraudulent accounts from my credit report.

Written confirmation that these accounts will not be reinserted.

Copies of the certification from the furnishers of the information, confirming its accuracy, as required by law prior to reinsertion.

Any rights that was inserted into the terms of the credit card agreement at time of application, I am revoking any and all permissions to share anything about me and my experience with your financial institution. 
Below is why I am requesting all of my transaction history to be deleted : 1. As a financial institution you must provide an initial notice to each customer explaining their privacy policies and practices regarding nonpublic personal information when the account was initially established and annually.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

3. As a financial institution you have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of your customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of our nonpublic personal information. You have not done that and have share my information to various non affilates.

4. As a financial institution you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ( credit reporting agencies ) any nonpublic personal information without my written consent.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies.

6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim. There are numerous laws that states I have the right to opt out and you must comply or be in violation of {$1000.00} per incedent. I am giving you 4 days to consult with your legal team to verify everything I have stated and to delete all of my nonpubic, transaction history from all CRAs immediately.

The amounts could potentially reach up to {$100000.00} per violation. As a consumer whose private information is being disclosed without consent may be able to sue the financial institution for damages, including compensation for emotional distress and legal fees. Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance.

I trust you will take this matter seriously and resolve the issue promptly. Please provide written confirmation that my transaction history has been removed from Experian, XXXX and XXXX XXXX immediately.

In compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and as a gesture of respect to the Federal Trade Commission Committee on accuracy and completeness of credit information I am formally writing in today to dispute negative information appearing on my credit. This incorrect information is greatly hindering me from getting the credit score I deserve and hopefully, this letter will resolve all the issues on my credit. I demand to see Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) of the accounts listed below. Your failure to positively verify these accounts has hurt my ability to obtain credit. This company is reporting inaccurate high credit amounts, Last reporting dates, Date last Active, and Date of last payment. In pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 Congressional Findings, The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Formal Request for Removal of Nonpublic Information and Violation Notice For Account Number XXXX Dear XXXX  XXXX, This is my final notice to formally request the removal of my nonpublic and transaction history to be deleted from Experian, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, also know as credit reporting agencies immediately. I am enforcing my consumer rights and privacy to what can and can not be shared with non affiated third parties. Any rights that was inserted into the terms of the credit card agreement at time of application, I am revoking any and all permissions to share anything about me and my experience with your financial institution. 
Below is why I am requesting all of my transaction history to be deleted : 1. As a financial institution you must provide an initial notice to each customer explaining their privacy policies and practices regarding nonpublic personal information when the account was initially established and annually.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

3. As a financial institution you have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of your customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of our nonpublic personal information. You have not done that and have share my information to various non affilates.

4. As a financial institution you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ( credit reporting agencies ) any nonpublic personal information without my written consent.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies.

6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim. There are numerous laws that states I have the right to opt out and you must comply or be in violation of {$1000.00} per incedent. I am giving you 4 days to consult with your legal team to verify everything I have stated and to delete all of my nonpubic, transaction history from all CRAs immediately. If you fail to comply, I am ready to take legal actions. Please verify with your legal team, under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions can face substantial fines for each instance of non-compliant disclosure after you have been advised to stop numerous times. The amounts could potentially reach up to {$100000.00} per violation. As a consumer whose private information is being disclosed without consent may be able to sue the financial institution for damages, including compensation for emotional distress and legal fees. Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance.

I trust you will take this matter seriously and resolve the issue promptly. Please provide written confirmation that my transaction history has been removed from Experian, XXXX and XXXX XXXX immediately. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Formal Request for Removal of Nonpublic Information and Violation Notice For Account Number XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX, This is my final notice to formally request the removal of my nonpublic and transaction history to be deleted from Experian, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, also know as credit reporting agencies immediately. I am enforcing my consumer rights and privacy to what can and can not be shared with non affiated third parties. Any rights that was inserted into the terms of the credit card agreement at time of application, I am revoking any and all permissions to share anything about me and my experience with your financial institution. 

I have sent several notices with a list of XXXX documents to validate the debt but was only sent the loan documents, the note ( not the stamped paid in full copy ) and I requested a signed, certified penalty under purjury affadavit to validate their claim they loaned me money and validate the loan wasn't satisfied at closing. I have yet to receive all requested documents. Instead, they tried to foreclose. 


Below is why I am requesting all my transaction history to be deleted : 1. As a financial institution you must provide an initial notice to each customer explaining their privacy policies and practices regarding nonpublic personal information when the account was initially established and annually.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

3. As a financial institution you have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of your customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of our nonpublic personal information. You have not done that and have share my information to various non affilates.

4. As a financial institution you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ( credit reporting agencies ) any nonpublic personal information without my written consent.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies.

6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim. There are numerous laws that states I have the right to opt out and you must comply or be in violation of {$1000.00} per incedent. I am giving you 4 days to consult with your legal team to verify everything I have stated and to delete all of my nonpubic, transaction history from all CRAs immediately. If you fail to comply, I am ready to take legal actions. Please verify with your legal team, under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions can face substantial fines for each instance of non-compliant disclosure after you have been advised to stop numerous times. The amounts could potentially reach up to {$100000.00} per violation. As a consumer whose private information is being disclosed without consent may be able to sue the financial institution for damages, including compensation for emotional distress and legal fees. Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance. 

I trust you will take this matter seriously and resolve the issue promptly. Please provide written confirmation that my transaction history has been removed from Experian, XXXX and XXXX XXXX immediately. My next step is to file my lawsuit to show the securities fraud, breach of contract and compel them to enter all requested documents into discovery to prove my claim. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 USC 1681 section 602 a states "" There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. '' XXXX, XXXX, and Experian are consumer reporting agencies and I am the Consumer.

'' ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) is a financial institution by definition under that title. 15 USC 1681 section 604 a section 2 states that "" In general Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. '' ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) the financial institution and the Consumer reporting agencies XXXX and Experian do not have my consent to furnish this information and they surely do not have my written consent. Any and all consent to XXXX, Experian, ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) whether it be verbal, non-verbal, written, implied or otherwise is revoked. 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) states that "" A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. '' ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) Never informed me of my right to exercise my nondisclosure option.

On both occasions, I provided the necessary documentation to demonstrate that the reported late payments on the account in question were inaccurate. However, the information continues to appear on my credit report without the requested corrections, negatively impacting my credit profile and my ability to access credit on fair terms. 

Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dates of Reported Late Payments : XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/year> It is important to note that this account is only being reported by Experian and does not appear on the reports of other credit bureaus, suggesting a lack of consistency in the reported information. 
Under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ), it is mandated that if the reinvestigation of a dispute does not resolve the consumers complaint, the credit reporting agency must delete the disputed information within five business days following the conclusion of the reinvestigation. Experian has failed to comply with this regulation by retaining the inaccurate information, constituting a direct violation of the FCRA. 
This negligence not only disregards Experians legal obligations but has also caused significant financial harm and emotional distress by impairing my ability to access credit under reasonable conditions. 
I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and intervene to ensure that Experian fulfills its responsibilities under the FCRA. I am requesting the immediate removal of the disputed account from my credit report and the implementation of necessary measures to prevent this situation from recurring. Additionally, I expect to receive confirmation of the actions taken by the CFPB in response to this complaint. 
Enclosed are supporting documents, including copies of the dispute letters sent to Experian, my credit report, and evidence of the inaccuracies in the reported information.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am submitting a formal complaint against the credit reporting agency Experian, which has failed to correct inaccurate information on my credit report following two formal dispute attempts. On both occasions, I provided the necessary documentation to demonstrate that the reported late payments on the account in question were inaccurate. However, the information continues to appear on my credit report without the requested corrections, negatively impacting my credit profile and my ability to access credit on fair terms. 

Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dates of Reported Late Payments : XXXX 2023, XX/XX/year>2023 It is important to note that this account is only being reported by Experian and does not appear on the reports of other credit bureaus, suggesting a lack of consistency in the reported information. 
Under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ), it is mandated that if the reinvestigation of a dispute does not resolve the consumers complaint, the credit reporting agency must delete the disputed information within five business days following the conclusion of the reinvestigation. Experian has failed to comply with this regulation by retaining the inaccurate information, constituting a direct violation of the FCRA. 
This negligence not only disregards Experians legal obligations but has also caused significant financial harm and emotional distress by impairing my ability to access credit under reasonable conditions. 
I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and intervene to ensure that Experian fulfills its responsibilities under the FCRA. I am requesting the immediate removal of the disputed account from my credit report and the implementation of necessary measures to prevent this situation from recurring. Additionally, I expect to receive confirmation of the actions taken by the CFPB in response to this complaint. 
Enclosed are supporting documents, including copies of the dispute letters sent to Experian, my credit report, and evidence of the inaccuracies in the reported information.

REQUEST FOR DETAILED VERIFICATION METHOD : We hereby invoke all rights under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 7 ) and FCRA 623, necessitating a comprehensive explanation of the procedures employed to investigate the disputed items. Please note that a simple e-Oscar 2-digit code readout will not suffice.

Regrettably, credit bureaus frequently rely on a mere software that fails to conduct exhaustive investigations, falling short of the legal standards for verification. Our legal team is keenly interested in understanding the process your investigators follow to reach their conclusions.

15 USC 1681 603 ( A ) ( 2 ) ( E ) The term investigative consumer report means a consumer report or portion thereof in which information on a consumers character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates of the consumer reported on or with others with whom he is acquainted or who may have knowledge concerning any such items of information. However, such information shall not include specific factual information on a consumers credit record obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from a consumer reporting agency when such information was obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from the consumer.

Verification means to make sure one actually owes the alleged debt, see XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). The definition of verification according to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is... averment that the party pleading is ready to establish the truth of what he has set forth. ... The examination of a writing for the purpose of ascertaining its truth ; or a certificate or af idavit that it is true.. The court said Confirmation of the correctness, truth, or authenticity of a pleading, account, or other paper, by an affidavit, oath, or deposition. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ; and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) ; and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). 

I request a complete list of all documents and correspondence ( s ) with the original creditor, including, but not limited to : 1. The names and contact details of ALL employees involved in this investigation.

2. Concrete evidence tracing back to the original creditor ; and 3. Comprehensive information about the entire lifecycle of the loan.

4. The identity of the individual or entity that initially issued the loan.

5. The exact date when the loan was granted.

6. The original contact details associated with the loan.

7. Copies of all correspondence and documents sent in relation to this matter.

8. Copies of insurance contracts paying the creditor, securities held as a result of the contract, or tax benefits they have received from holding this account.

If an investigation can not be conducted or the required documents can not be located, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates the removal of the information from the credit reports, including the complete deletion of the account.

However, if an investigation of the account records can be carried out and inaccurately reported information is identified, it is necessary to update the credit reports to accurately reflect this information.

DEBT INVALIDATION NOTICE - Please find enclosed the correspondence sent to the alleged creditor. The absence of a validation response from the creditor automatically invalidates the account, serving as evidence of identity fraud. By law, this account must be expunged from the credit report. We request an updated credit report reflecting the resolution of the account dispute.

NOTICE OF FRAUD ALERT - This serves as a notice that you are now implicated in fraud by verifying information that can not be substantiated/ validated due to the absence of an authenticated contract with the creditor. If the agency fails to remove this information, we will be compelled to initiate legal proceedings for deliberate non-compliance under FCRA 616 and 15 U.S. Code 1681n.

OPPORTUNITY TO CURE - A point-by-point response to these demands in the form of an afidavit is legally required. As the XXXX, He who does not deny, admits, and An unrebutted affidavit stands as truth. According to Restatement 2nd 69, failure to respond within fifteen days will be taken as an admission that the debt is unverified, all legal claims are relinquished and are to be released, and the entity named on the account is a victim of identity fraud. If the debt is not verified, a demand is made to dismiss and withdraw the claim, and rectify any negative credit reporting that may have been associated with the alleged debt for all Credit Reporting Agencies ( CRAs ) and Credit Bureaus ( CBs ).

FINAL APPEAL TO AVOID LITIGATION - Legal proceedings can be costly and are best avoided. If necessary, I am prepared to represent myself in court and file a case in forma pauperis at no cost. However, I understand that your organization may need to engage an attorney, which could be expensive. This is so even if I choose to utilize Small Claims Court and require all claimants only, to appear with evidence and testify with first hand knowledge only. Therefore, this is a sincere attempt to settle this matter before resorting to litigation. I am open to resolving this issue in a private and amicable manner.

Thank you for your consideration and attention to this matter.

Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dates of Reported Late Payments : XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/year> It is important to note that this account is only being reported by Experian and does not appear on the reports of other credit bureaus, suggesting a lack of consistency in the reported information. 
Under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ), it is mandated that if the reinvestigation of a dispute does not resolve the consumers complaint, the credit reporting agency must delete the disputed information within five business days following the conclusion of the reinvestigation. Experian has failed to comply with this regulation by retaining the inaccurate information, constituting a direct violation of the FCRA. 
This negligence not only disregards Experians legal obligations but has also caused significant financial harm and emotional distress by impairing my ability to access credit under reasonable conditions. 
I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and intervene to ensure that Experian fulfills its responsibilities under the FCRA. I am requesting the immediate removal of the disputed account from my credit report and the implementation of necessary measures to prevent this situation from recurring. Additionally, I expect to receive confirmation of the actions taken by the CFPB in response to this complaint. 
Enclosed are supporting documents, including copies of the dispute letters sent to Experian, my credit report, and evidence of the inaccuracies in the reported information. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that a prompt resolution will ensure the accuracy and fairness in the handling of my credit report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,32256,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10509027

This company has failed to contact me or provide any proper validation of the alleged debt, as required by federal law. 

I do not believe that this debt is valid, nor have I had any prior dealings with Credit Collection Services. Furthermore, I suspect that this company illegally obtained my personal information and improperly used it to report inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. 

Under the FCRA, companies reporting debts must take the following steps : Provide written notice of the debt within five days of first contact.

Offer me the opportunity to dispute the debt and request validation within 30 days.

Upon dispute, supply proper documentation that validates the debt, including any original agreements or contracts with my signature.

Credit Collection Services has failed to follow these legal requirements. They did not notify me, provide any form of communication, or supply proper documentation verifying this debt. Reporting unverified information is not only unethical but also illegal under the FCRA. 

I am demanding that XXXX XXXX XXXX remove this unverified and inaccurate debt from my credit report immediately. If this issue is not resolved within 14 days of receiving this letter, I will have no choice but to pursue legal action against the company for violations of my consumer rights. 

I request that the CFPB investigate this matter promptly to ensure compliance and protect my credit profile from further harm. I also ask that written confirmation be provided once this debt is removed. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Before my home sold, we secured an approved transfer of the loan to the buyer ( the process itself was very difficult and the company tried to deny the buyer of the home multiple times without explanation ). After we received an approval, we submitted the transfer and assumption paperwork and our home sold to the buyers a few days later. In XXXX I received notification that the account was in collections in my name, and the company denied ever issuing the approvals even though we have everything in writing and on company letterhead, and emails! They said they issued a denial via mail without informing any of the parties involved in the home sale, days after issuing the approval and only two days prior to when our home was set to be sold to out of state buyers. After I spent countless hours on the phone and via email attempting to resolve this, I am at a standstill. Since XXXX, the company accepted their approval of the loan, and transferred to the buyer. My credit report is still affected almost 90 days later, and as of last week this debt was temporarily removed. This week, the debt was reinstated on my credit report as belonging to me after I submitted a dispute directly with the credit bureau. My credit score was negatively impacted by at last XXXX points for the last 4 months minimum, and it's caused an incredible amount of stress, I've not been able to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or even open up a new high yield savings account. An account executive confirmed last week XX/XX/XXXX on the phone that in order for it to be re-instated on my credit report, it needs to be confirmed by the company that the information is accurate ( meaning they reinstated the debt and missed payments as belonging to me ). The company also fraudulently back dated the payoff dates in my payment portal to show the loan was paid off XX/XX/XXXX, which is at 10 days before our home sold, to cover up this entire situation. I have proof that this was not done until at least XX/XX/XXXX ( this account view that I downloaded shows the debt on my portal, delinquency letters, etc ). Multiple times throughout this process I requested proof of submission of the correction sent to the credit bureaus, and nothing was provided. The company refused to take accountability for this situation or attempt to resolve this. The account executive I spoke with XX/XX/XXXX had empathy, but also acknowledged this ridiculous situation as something that should never have happened.

2024-10-20,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Account sold or transferred to another company,"To Whom It May Concern at Synchrony Bank/XXXX  , I am writing to formally file a complaint against Synchrony Bank ( SYNCB ) for inaccurately reporting late payments related to a closed account and for illegally reporting transaction history and income. These actions violate several federal consumer protection laws, specifically the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Privacy Act of 1974. 

Violations Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( FCRA ) - Accuracy and Fairness of Credit Reporting Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), furnishers of credit information must implement reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information reported. SYNCB has failed to verify the accuracy of the late payments on my closed account. SYNCB has not provided any validation or sufficient documentation to support these claims. Consequently, my credit report contains false and misleading information that undermines my creditworthiness.

Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b - Permissible Purposes of Consumer Reports According to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), consumer reporting agencies may only furnish a consumer 's report with my consent or for permissible purposes. SYNCB is illegally reporting transaction history and income, which is not permissible under IRS guidelines. I did not authorize the release of this inaccurate information, and my consent has not been properly obtained or documented.

Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) - Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), furnishers like SYNCB are prohibited from reporting information if they know or have reasonable cause to believe the information is inaccurate. The late payments being reported are indeed inaccurate, and SYNCB is violating this provision by continuing to report them. Additionally, SYNCB has a duty under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ) to correct or update information after a consumer disputes its accuracy. Despite my disputes regarding these late payments, SYNCB has failed to make the necessary corrections.

Violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 SYNCB has an obligation under the Privacy Act of 1974 to protect the privacy of its customers ' financial information. The ongoing reporting of inaccurate late payments without proper validation and disclosure violates my privacy rights and exposes my personal information to third parties without authorization. SYNCB has no
t sufficiently safeguarded my financial information nor provided the required disclosures.

Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681c - Illegal Reporting of Transactions Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), certain adverse information, including late payments, can not be reported to consumer reporting agencies if it falls outside the permissible scope outlined by the law. SYNCB is currently reporting late payments related to a closed account, which is illegal under the FCRA. This is a direct violation of consumer reporting guidelines and must be immediately corrected.

Violation of 12 CFR 1022.43 - Investigations of Disputes According to 12 CFR 1022.43, if a consumer disputes the accuracy of information being reported, the furnisher must investigate and respond promptly. I have notified SYNCB of the inaccuracies related to late payments on my closed account ; however, they have not conducted a reasonable investigation or provided a timely resolution. This failure constitutes a violation of the law. 
Ongoing Trading on a Closed Account Despite the account being officially closed, SYNCB continues to engage in trading activities related to this account. This practice misrepresents the account 's status and raises serious legal concerns regarding compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b, SYNCB is prohibited from reporting any information that misleads consumers about the nature of their accounts. The continued trading on a closed account constitutes a violation of these provisions and undermines my rights as a consumer.

Securities Fraud and Lack of Full Disclosure SYNCBs actions may constitute securities fraud, particularly in light of the lack of transparency regarding financial transactions. The statements I received imply that a payment due is linked to trading activities involving assets assigned to SYNCB for their financial gain. This not only violates the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 but also raises questions about SYNCBs compliance with 15 U.S.C. 78j ( b ), which prohibits deceptive practices in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. The absence of full disclosure regarding how my payments and transactions are handled is a blatant disregard for my rights and trust as a consumer.

Failure to Disclose Accounting Practices SYNCBs failure to disclose accounting practices related to my closed account represents a violation of 15 U.S.C. 6801, which mandates that financial institutions take appropriate measures to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of consumer information. By not providing clear and accurate documentation regarding how my payments and transactions are recorded, SYNCB is breaching this privacy obligation and potentially violating consumer protection laws designed to promote transparency and fairness. Such practices can lead to severe financial repercussions and further mental anguish for me as the affected party. 

Failure to Provide Notice and Opt-Out Opportunity SYNCB has failed to provide the required notice regarding my right to opt out of reporting my nonpublic personal information to non-affiliated third parties, as mandated by 15 U.S.C. 6802. Creditors are required to provide notice and an opt-out option before sharing such information. The lack of this notice implies a violation of my privacy rights and compliance obligations under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) guidelines.

Demand for Action I demand that SYNCB : Correct the reporting on my account to reflect paid as agreed or paid in full.

Direct all payments and securities transferred or assigned to third parties back to me in good faith.

Provide written confirmation of the actions taken.

Damages Due to the mental anguish and emotional distress caused by SYNCB 's actions, I am seeking damages in the amount of {$10000.00}. Additionally, for all other related damages outside the court of law, I am requesting {$50000.00}. If we can not reach an agreement, please be advised that I will provide my fee schedule upon litigation.

These unauthorized changes occurred on XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>. 

I have filed several disputes with Equifax to investigate the matter, under the following dispute numbers : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 

In each instance, I specifically requested information on the creditor or entity responsible for initiating these unauthorized changes to my address. However, despite multiple requests, Equifax has continuously failed to provide this critical information. Instead, their responses have been irrelevant to my requests, dodging my direct inquiries about the identity of the creditor involved.

This pattern of avoidance is concerning, as the unauthorized changes have affected the accuracy of my credit file, and the lack of transparency on the part of Equifax has further exacerbated my frustration with this matter. I am now seeking the assistance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to ensure that Equifax complies with its obligations to provide me with the information I am entitled to under the law.

Please help facilitate a thorough investigation into this issue, and hold Equifax accountable for their failure to respond appropriately to my requests.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"To Whom It May Concern, I am formally submitting a complaint against all credit agencies for multiple violations of federal consumer protection laws, specifically the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Privacy Act of 1974. These violations have caused me significant harm, including financial loss and emotional distress.

Violations Breach of Privacy The unauthorized furnishing of my account information by third parties has compromised my trust and potentially exposed my identity to unknown entities. This violates 15 U.S.C. 1681, Section 602.

Lack of Written Consent You are required to obtain my written consent before adding any information to my consumer report. Since I did not authorize these actions, you are in violation of the FCRA. 

Illegal Reporting of Transaction History The reporting of my transaction history and income discrepancies in violation of IRS guidelines, including certificates of indebtedness, is illegal. This false and misleading reporting has caused me severe harm and mental anguish.

Identity Theft Violation According to 12 CFR 1022.3, identity theft involves using another person 's identifying information without authorization. This definition applies to the fraudulent activity related to my account. 

Unwanted Emails and Phone Calls I have received numerous unwanted emails and phone calls during business hours from fraudulent companies. This constant disruption is unacceptable and violates my rights.

Verification of Identity Credit agencies must verify the identity of prospective users before furnishing a consumer report. You have failed to ensure that reports were furnished for permissible purposes as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681b.

Inaccuracy of Reporting Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), you must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of reported information. Your failure to comply with sections 1681b and 1681c demonstrates a lack of adherence to these requirements.

Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance As stated in 15 U.S.C. 1681n, any person who willfully fails to comply with the FCRA is liable for damages. I am entitled to {$1000.00} for each violation due to your noncompliance, which totals {$8000.00} based on the eight violations outlined above.

Emotional Distress The ongoing violations have caused me over four years of duress, significantly disrupting my quality of life. 

Demands I demand immediate correction of false and misleading information reported by XXXX and XXXX, along with the removal of all related inquiries. If we can not come to an agreement, please be advised that I will pursue this matter in federal court. 

Next Steps If these issues are not resolved immediately, I will escalate my complaints to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regarding potential securities fraud. 

I expect all credit agencies to take responsibility for these violations. I demand the removal of any outdated or duplicate addresses, phone numbers, and incorrect name variations from my report. Should you fail to address these matters, I will pursue legal action against the credit agencies and their executives for securities fraud.

The accounts are : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. There is a record of late payments and that is not correct. 

According to consumer protection, EQUIFAX is violating the following laws : 1. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 and 15 U.S. Code 1681i.

2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness. 

3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

5. It should be noted that the dates on which the alleged late payments are being reported coincide with the date on which the covid-19 pandemic began, violating a very important law which is the ''The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX '' The dates on which the incorrect late payments appear are described in each account as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Formal Request for Removal of Nonpublic Information and Violation Notice For Account Number XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX, This is my final notice to formally request the removal of my nonpublic and transaction history to be deleted from XXXX, Equifax and XXXX XXXX, also know as credit reporting agencies immediately. I am enforcing my consumer rights and privacy to what can and can not be shared with non affiated third parties. Any rights that was inserted into the terms of the credit card agreement at time of application, I am revoking any and all permissions to share anything about me and my experience with your financial institution. 

I have sent several notices with a list of XXXX documents to validate the debt but was only sent the loan documents, the note ( not the stamped paid in full copy ) and I requested a signed, certified penalty under purjury affadavit to validate their claim they loaned me money and validate the loan wasn't satisfied at closing. I have yet to receive all requested documents. Instead, they tried to foreclose. 


Below is why I am requesting all my transaction history to be deleted : 1. As a financial institution you must provide an initial notice to each customer explaining their privacy policies and practices regarding nonpublic personal information when the account was initially established and annually.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

3. As a financial institution you have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of your customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of our nonpublic personal information. You have not done that and have share my information to various non affilates.

4. As a financial institution you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ( credit reporting agencies ) any nonpublic personal information without my written consent.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies.

6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim. There are numerous laws that states I have the right to opt out and you must comply or be in violation of {$1000.00} per incedent. I am giving you 4 days to consult with your legal team to verify everything I have stated and to delete all of my nonpubic, transaction history from all CRAs immediately. If you fail to comply, I am ready to take legal actions. Please verify with your legal team, under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions can face substantial fines for each instance of non-compliant disclosure after you have been advised to stop numerous times. The amounts could potentially reach up to {$100000.00} per violation. As a consumer whose private information is being disclosed without consent may be able to sue the financial institution for damages, including compensation for emotional distress and legal fees. Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance. 

I trust you will take this matter seriously and resolve the issue promptly. Please provide written confirmation that my transaction history has been removed from XXXX, Equifax and XXXX XXXX immediately. My next step is to file my lawsuit to show the securities fraud, breach of contract and compel them to enter all requested documents into discovery to prove my claim. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Regrettably, credit bureaus frequently rely on a mere software that fails to conduct exhaustive investigations, falling short of the legal standards for verification. Our legal team is keenly interested in understanding the process your investigators follow to reach their conclusions.

15 USC 1681 603 ( A ) ( 2 ) ( E ) The term investigative consumer report means a consumer report or portion thereof in which information on a consumers character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates of the consumer reported on or with others with whom he is acquainted or who may have knowledge concerning any such items of information. However, such information shall not include specific factual information on a consumers credit record obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from a consumer reporting agency when such information was obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from the consumer.

Verification means to make sure one actually owes the alleged debt, see XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). The definition of verification according to Black 's Law Dictionary is... averment that the party pleading is ready to establish the truth of what he has set forth. ... The examination of a writing for the purpose of ascertaining its truth ; or a certificate or af idavit that it is true.. The court said Confirmation of the correctness, truth, or authenticity of a pleading, account, or other paper, by an affidavit, oath, or deposition. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ; and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ; and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ). 

I request a complete list of all documents and correspondence ( s ) with the original creditor, including, but not limited to : 1. The names and contact details of ALL employees involved in this investigation.

2. Concrete evidence tracing back to the original creditor ; and 3. Comprehensive information about the entire lifecycle of the loan.

4. The identity of the individual or entity that initially issued the loan.

5. The exact date when the loan was granted.

6. The original contact details associated with the loan.

7. Copies of all correspondence and documents sent in relation to this matter.

8. Copies of insurance contracts paying the creditor, securities held as a result of the contract, or tax benefits they have received from holding this account.

If an investigation can not be conducted or the required documents can not be located, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates the removal of the information from the credit reports, including the complete deletion of the account.

However, if an investigation of the account records can be carried out and inaccurately reported information is identified, it is necessary to update the credit reports to accurately reflect this information.

DEBT INVALIDATION NOTICE - Please find enclosed the correspondence sent to the alleged creditor. The absence of a validation response from the creditor automatically invalidates the account, serving as evidence of identity fraud. By law, this account must be expunged from the credit report. We request an updated credit report reflecting the resolution of the account dispute.

NOTICE OF FRAUD ALERT - This serves as a notice that you are now implicated in fraud by verifying information that can not be substantiated/ validated due to the absence of an authenticated contract with the creditor. If the agency fails to remove this information, we will be compelled to initiate legal proceedings for deliberate non-compliance under FCRA 616 and 15 U.S. Code 1681n.

OPPORTUNITY TO CURE - A point-by-point response to these demands in the form of an afidavit is legally required. As the XXXX, He who does not deny, admits, and An unrebutted affidavit stands as truth. According to Restatement 2nd 69, failure to respond within fifteen days will be taken as an admission that the debt is unverified, all legal claims are relinquished and are to be released, and the entity named on the account is a victim of identity fraud. If the debt is not verified, a demand is made to dismiss and withdraw the claim, and rectify any negative credit reporting that may have been associated with the alleged debt for all Credit Reporting Agencies ( CRAs ) and Credit Bureaus ( CBs ).

FINAL APPEAL TO AVOID LITIGATION - Legal proceedings can be costly and are best avoided. If necessary, I am prepared to represent myself in court and file a case in forma pauperis at no cost. However, I understand that your organization may need to engage an attorney, which could be expensive. This is so even if I choose to utilize Small Claims Court and require all claimants only, to appear with evidence and testify with first hand knowledge only. Therefore, this is a sincere attempt to settle this matter before resorting to litigation. I am open to resolving this issue in a private and amicable manner.

Thank you for your consideration and attention to this matter.

I have the right to make sure my private information isn't shared which is backed by 15 USC 6801 which states '' It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information. '' ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) is a financial institution by definition under that title. 15 USC 1681 section 604 a section 2 states that "" In general Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. '' ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) the financial institution and the Consumer reporting agencies Equifax and XXXX do not have my consent to furnish this information and they surely do not have my written consent.

Under 15 USC 1681 ( e ) ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are legally required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in their reports. This has clearly not been done in my case, and the errors remain unaddressed.

Under 15 USC 1681i ( 5 ), it is the agencys responsibility to promptly delete or correct any information found to be inaccurate and incomplete during a dispute. Despite this legal requirement, the inaccuracies continue to persist on my report, causing unnecessary hardship.

Under 15 USC 1681s-2 explicitly states that furnishers must not report information they know, or have reasonable cause to believe, is inaccurate. These accounts have been reported in violation of this law.

Account Information : Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date of Charge Off : XX/XX/year> Amount : {$0.00} Despite providing clear evidence of the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account and requesting its removal from my credit report, Equifax has failed to comply with the law and has retained the inaccurate account information.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act mandates that if a reinvestigation does not resolve a dispute, the credit bureau must delete the disputed information within five business days. The repeated failure of Equifax to adhere to this requirement is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) and has caused me financial harm and distress.

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take immediate action against Equifax for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate deletion of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Equifax upholds its obligations under the law.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Formal Request for Removal of Nonpublic Information and Violation Notice For Account Number XXXX Dear XXXX  XXXX, This is my final notice to formally request the removal of my nonpublic and transaction history to be deleted from XXXX, Equifax and XXXX XXXX, also know as credit reporting agencies immediately. I am enforcing my consumer rights and privacy to what can and can not be shared with non affiated third parties. Any rights that was inserted into the terms of the credit card agreement at time of application, I am revoking any and all permissions to share anything about me and my experience with your financial institution. 
Below is why I am requesting all of my transaction history to be deleted : 1. As a financial institution you must provide an initial notice to each customer explaining their privacy policies and practices regarding nonpublic personal information when the account was initially established and annually.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

3. As a financial institution you have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of your customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of our nonpublic personal information. You have not done that and have share my information to various non affilates.

4. As a financial institution you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ( credit reporting agencies ) any nonpublic personal information without my written consent.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies.

6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim. There are numerous laws that states I have the right to opt out and you must comply or be in violation of {$1000.00} per incedent. I am giving you 4 days to consult with your legal team to verify everything I have stated and to delete all of my nonpubic, transaction history from all CRAs immediately. If you fail to comply, I am ready to take legal actions. Please verify with your legal team, under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions can face substantial fines for each instance of non-compliant disclosure after you have been advised to stop numerous times. The amounts could potentially reach up to {$100000.00} per violation. As a consumer whose private information is being disclosed without consent may be able to sue the financial institution for damages, including compensation for emotional distress and legal fees. Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance.

I trust you will take this matter seriously and resolve the issue promptly. Please provide written confirmation that my transaction history has been removed from XXXX, Equifax and XXXX XXXX immediately. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

This incorrect information is greatly hindering me from getting the credit score I deserve and hopefully, this letter will resolve all the issues on my credit. I demand to see Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) of the accounts listed below. Your failure to positively verify these accounts has hurt my ability to obtain credit. This company is reporting inaccurate high credit amounts, Last reporting dates, Date last Active, and Date of last payment. In pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 Congressional Findings, The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

3. As a financial institution you have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of your customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of our nonpublic personal information. You have not done that and have share my information to various non affilates.

4. As a financial institution you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ( credit reporting agencies ) any nonpublic personal information without my written consent.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies. 
6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim.

Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance.

These violations have caused me significant harm, including financial loss and emotional distress.

Violations Breach of Privacy The unauthorized furnishing of my account information by third parties has compromised my trust and potentially exposed my identity to unknown entities. This violates 15 U.S.C. 1681, Section 602.

Lack of Written Consent You are required to obtain my written consent before adding any information to my consumer report. Since I did not authorize these actions, you are in violation of the FCRA. 

Illegal Reporting of Transaction History The reporting of my transaction history and income discrepancies in violation of IRS guidelines, including certificates of indebtedness, is illegal. This false and misleading reporting has caused me severe harm and mental anguish.

Identity Theft Violation According to 12 CFR 1022.3, identity theft involves using another person 's identifying information without authorization. This definition applies to the fraudulent activity related to my account. 

Unwanted Emails and Phone Calls I have received numerous unwanted emails and phone calls during business hours from fraudulent companies. This constant disruption is unacceptable and violates my rights.

Verification of Identity Credit agencies must verify the identity of prospective users before furnishing a consumer report. You have failed to ensure that reports were furnished for permissible purposes as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681b.

Inaccuracy of Reporting Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), you must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of reported information. Your failure to comply with sections 1681b and 1681c demonstrates a lack of adherence to these requirements.

Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance As stated in 15 U.S.C. 1681n, any person who willfully fails to comply with the FCRA is liable for damages. I am entitled to {$1000.00} for each violation due to your noncompliance, which totals {$8000.00} based on the eight violations outlined above.

Emotional Distress The ongoing violations have caused me over four years of duress, significantly disrupting my quality of life.

Demands I demand immediate correction of false and misleading information reported by XXXX and XXXX, along with the removal of all related inquiries. If we can not come to an agreement, please be advised that I will pursue this matter in federal court.

Next Steps If these issues are not resolved immediately, I will escalate my complaints to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regarding potential securities fraud.

I expect all credit agencies to take responsibility for these violations. I demand the removal of any outdated or duplicate addresses, phone numbers, and incorrect name variations from my report. Should you fail to address these matters, I will pursue legal action against the credit agencies and their executives for securities fraud.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"XXXX XXXX took over our loan without our knowledge. It caused for lots of confusion in where payments were going. We had no idea and were paying both mortgage companies for over 6 months. During the transition our home burned down and we were displaced and not regularly receiving mail so I called in multiple times. We were sending payments in to XXXX XXXX but it wasnt going to the correct department. We had no idea. They have provided an incorrect address twice in XXXX  years. They also adjusted our mortgage without our knowledge making the auto pay not be enough to cover. They have never been paid late, as all of our payments have been on auto draft from my bank. Ive been trying to resolve this for a year and Ive been sent to several escalation departments or supervisors but no action taken. Ive provided historic payments for XXXX  months showing money being mailed on the first of each month. When reviewing with customer service they acknowledge that the payments did come in but were not processed timely due to them being in the wrong desk of XXXX XXXX. The supervisor corrected the address with my bank for future payment but refused to modify the adverse reporting. He also share that there was some type of late charge that had been carried over from a previous mortgage when they took my loan. Ive never been told of that but its whats been reported as over 90 days late and transfers month to month. Im in dispute about the {$440.00} late fee and refused to pay it with clear explanation to validate it. That could not be provided. We have over XXXX in equity in our home and recently experienced life altering circumstances forcing us to request equity. Because the the adverse reporting, we are unable to access our equity and when trying to get away from XXXX XXXX, no one will take us due to the late payment reported. The supervisor I mentioned advised me to report this to the credit bureaus and even gave their address and process for adverse reporting. He said he was looking in the notes and could clearly see the problems but was not able to modify on his end but the investigation would show it when they called and it should be corrected. Trans union reached out but said that I need to get XXXX  to change it so thus nothing is being done and my family remains in dire need to access our equity.

Account Information : Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date of Charge Off : XX/XX/year> Amount : {$0.00} Despite providing clear evidence of the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account and requesting its removal from my credit report, Equifax has failed to comply with the law and has retained the inaccurate account information.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act mandates that if a reinvestigation does not resolve a dispute, the credit bureau must delete the disputed information within five business days. The repeated failure of Equifax to adhere to this requirement is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) and has caused me financial harm and distress.

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take immediate action against Equifax for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate deletion of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Equifax upholds its obligations under the law.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution and your assistance in rectifying this issue.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33157,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10508727

Account Information : - Account Number : XXXX - Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX Date of Charge Off : XX/XX/year> - Amount : {$0.00} The account in question is an auto loan that was reported as charge off but has been paid in full. Despite providing documentation in previous disputes that demonstrates the inaccuracies of this information, TransUnion has failed to remove it from my credit report. Additionally, this account is reported solely by TransUnion and not by other credit bureaus, which further indicates an error in the reporting. 
The FCRA requires credit bureaus to delete disputed information within five business days after the reinvestigation if the dispute is not resolved, as stipulated in 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ). The continued presence of this incorrect account on my report violates the following FCRA provisions : 1. 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) - Credit bureaus are legally required to ensure maximum accuracy of the information they report. The fact that this charge off appears exclusively in TransUnions report suggests that TransUnion has failed to verify the accuracy of its data.

2. 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) - TransUnion is required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when the accuracy of any item in the report is questioned. The failure to correct the disputed information after two attempts constitutes a violation of this obligation. 
TransUnions lack of compliance has caused significant financial damage and emotional distress, impacting my ability to access credit fairly. I request the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly and take the necessary actions against TransUnion for its continued non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
I am seeking the immediate deletion of this inaccurate account from my credit report and any other remedies deemed appropriate by the CFPB to ensure that TransUnion fulfills its legal obligations. Attached to this complaint, please find the supporting documentation, including the original disputes, proof of payment for the auto loan, and my current credit report reflecting the erroneous information.

I asked for these documents to show proof that I was illegally charged on my account by Victoria Secret/Comenity Bank for a service that I never agreed to. They have no signature physical or electronic for that service and I have asked them to supply me a copy of the signature that says I signed up for it and they can't because I never did. I paid this credit card off in full. A month later Victoria Secret/Comenity Bank called me trying to sell me a service called XXXX XXXX. I declined these services. Victoria Secret/Comenity Bank then charged my account anyways for a {$0.00} charge labeled XXXX XXXX per the credit card statement. Because of this {$0.00} charge it triggered a minimum interest charge of {$2.00} causing my account to have a balance of {$2.00} after I paid it all off which racked up late fees over time. I tried to tell Comenity Bank, Victoria Secret, and now XXXX XXXX XXXX that this is because of illegal charges on my account. You can not charge someone for credit card insurance that they never agreed to. Noone will listen to me or help me even though they provided me the statement with the proof that clearly says this charge was not for any previous interest, previous purchase, or interest from current billing cycles..Meaning this is not leftover interest from the previous billing cycle which is what they tried to tell me until I showed them the proof. The account was paid off on XX/XX/year>. The illegal charge for the {$0.00} XXXX XXXX insurance was put on my account on XX/XX/year>. Again, I have asked for XXXX and Comenity to supply me with an electronic or physical signature that says I signed up for this to cause this charge and they can't. I paid it off with no intention of ever using it again so there is no reason I would need account insurance. They have to supply proof of this and they can't because I never agreed. Victoria Secret, Comenity, and XXXX should all be held legally liable for the damage they have done and for seeing the proof of what I'm saying is true and pretending they don't. A woman at XXXX even agreed with me that this was illegal then I never heard from her again. They keep trying to come after me for payment anyways.

Under 15 USC 1681 ( e ) ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are legally required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in their reports. This has clearly not been done in my case, and the errors remain unaddressed.

Under 15 USC 1681i ( 5 ), it is the agencys responsibility to promptly delete or correct any information found to be inaccurate and incomplete during a dispute. Despite this legal requirement, the inaccuracies continue to persist on my report, causing unnecessary hardship.

Under 15 USC 1681s-2 explicitly states that furnishers must not report information they know, or have reasonable cause to believe, is inaccurate. These accounts have been reported in violation of this law.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Heres a more detailed version of your CFPB complaint : Subject : Repeated Failure to Remove Unauthorized Hard Inquiry FCRA Violation To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint against TransUnion for repeatedly failing to remove an unauthorized hard inquiry from my credit report, despite multiple requests and promises that the issue would be resolved. 

The unauthorized inquiry, which was added to my credit report on XX/XX/year>, occurred without my consent or authorization. Upon noticing this, I contacted TransUnion on several occasions to have the inaccurate information removed. Specifically, I reached out on XX/XX/year>, and again on XX/XX/year>. During my most recent interaction on XX/XX/year>, I was provided written confirmation from TransUnion stating that the unauthorized inquiry would be removed within two days. However, despite this written assurance, it has now been more than a month, and the unauthorized inquiry remains on my credit report. 

TransUnions repeated failure to remove this incorrect information constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). As you are aware, the FCRA requires that credit reporting agencies investigate and correct inaccuracies within 30 days. The inquiry has not been removed within this legally mandated timeframe, despite multiple requests on my part and clear communication from TransUnion that they would take action. 

The presence of this unauthorized hard inquiry on my credit report is continuing to negatively affect my credit score, and the lack of resolution is causing me significant frustration and financial harm. I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) take immediate action to ensure that TransUnion fully complies with their legal obligations under the FCRA and removes this unauthorized inquiry from my credit report. 

Additionally, I would like confirmation that my credit score will be updated to reflect the removal of this inquiry, as it has unfairly impacted my overall financial standing. I have documentation of my interactions with TransUnion and am prepared to provide any additional information that is necessary for the investigation. 

Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter. I trust that the CFPB will help to ensure this issue is promptly resolved. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX [ Your Contact Information : Phone and Email ]",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,78731,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10515515

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), consumer reporting agencies are legally obligated to maintain accurate and complete information.

The errors include incorrect reporting of the credit limit, last payment date, term length, late payment activity, and date reported. 

As required by law, I am requesting that these inaccuracies be thoroughly investigated and corrected. Due to the nature of these violations, I am requesting that this account be completely removed from my credit reports across all three major bureaus within 15 days. Failure to rectify this promptly may result in further legal action to enforce my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

The accounts are : # XXXX, # XXXX, # XXXX and # XXXX. There is a record of late payments and that is not correct. 

According to consumer protection, TRANSUNION is violating the following laws : 1. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 and 15 U.S. Code 1681i.

2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

3. Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

4. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

5. It should be noted that the dates on which the alleged late payments are being reported coincide with the date on which the covid-19 pandemic began, violating a very important law which is the ''The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act ( 2020 ) '' The dates on which the incorrect late payments appear are described in each account as follows : Account # XXXX, dates : XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>.

Account # XXXX, dates : XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>. 

TRANSUNION must respect consumer protection laws and assume its responsibility to take care of citizens and not take advantage of wanting to benefit from inaccurate information.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"My complaint is regarding the unauthorized addition of an account to my consumer credit report, which is a direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically, an account from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was added to my report without my permission or knowledge. This account had previously been removed from my report on XX/XX/2023, yet it has now been re-added, which constitutes unlawful and inaccurate reporting. 

Details of the Issue : Account in Question : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Removed : XX/XX/2023 File Number : XXXX TransUnions action of re-adding this account is a violation of FCRA 1681b, which governs the permissible purposes for accessing and reporting information on a consumers credit file. No valid or permissible purpose exists for this account to be placed on my credit report again after it had been correctly removed. 

Violations of the FCRA : FCRA 1681b Permissible Purposes of Consumer Reports According to FCRA 1681b, a consumer reporting agency can only provide a consumer report under specific circumstances, such as a credit application, insurance underwriting, or court order. In this case, there was no permissible purpose for TransUnion to re-add the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account without my knowledge or authorization. This action is a clear violation of the FCRAs provisions on the use of consumer reports.

FCRA 1681e ( b ) Duty to Follow Reasonable Procedures to Assure Accuracy Under FCRA 1681e ( b ), TransUnion is required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information reported on my consumer file. By re-reporting an account that was previously removed, TransUnion has failed in this duty, causing inaccurate and damaging information to appear on my report. 

Failure to Comply with Prior Removal Request TransUnion previously acknowledged and removed this account on XX/XX/2023. The fact that this account has been re-added without my consent or notification is further evidence that proper procedures were not followed, and this represents a failure to adhere to the FCRAs provisions on consumer protection. 

Harm Caused : TransUnions illegal re-reporting of this account has caused the following harms : Damage to my credit score as a result of the inaccurate reporting of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account. 
Negative impact on my ability to secure credit, as creditors may view this inaccurately re-reported account as a sign of unresolved financial issues.

Emotional distress, given the unnecessary frustration and time spent addressing an issue that had already been resolved. 
Actions Requested : I demand that TransUnion immediately : Permanently remove the unauthorized XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account from my credit report. 
Cease all future reporting of this account unless properly authorized by me with a legitimate permissible purpose.

Provide written confirmation of the removal of the account and that no further action will be taken to report it.

Investigate how this account was added back to my report without authorization and provide me with a detailed explanation of the findings.

Should TransUnion fail to comply with these requests, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and consider legal action to seek damages for violations under the FCRA, including but not limited to FCRA 1681n for willful non-compliance and FCRA 1681o for negligent non-compliance.

I expect a timely response and resolution of this issue within 24 hours.

Account Information : - Account Number : XXXX - Creditor Name : XXXX  - Date of Charge Off : XX/XX/2019 - Amount : {$0.00} The account in question is an auto loan that was reported as charge off but has been paid in full. Despite providing documentation in previous disputes that demonstrates the inaccuracies of this information, TransUnion has failed to remove it from my credit report. Additionally, this account is reported solely by TransUnion and not by other credit bureaus, which further indicates an error in the reporting. 
The FCRA requires credit bureaus to delete disputed information within five business days after the reinvestigation if the dispute is not resolved, as stipulated in 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ). The continued presence of this incorrect account on my report violates the following FCRA provisions : 1. 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) - Credit bureaus are legally required to ensure maximum accuracy of the information they report. The fact that this charge off appears exclusively in TransUnions report suggests that TransUnion has failed to verify the accuracy of its data.

2. 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) - TransUnion is required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when the accuracy of any item in the report is questioned. The failure to correct the disputed information after two attempts constitutes a violation of this obligation.

TransUnions lack of compliance has caused significant financial damage and emotional distress, impacting my ability to access credit fairly. I request the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly and take the necessary actions against TransUnion for its continued non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

I am seeking the immediate deletion of this inaccurate account from my credit report and any other remedies deemed appropriate by the CFPB to ensure that TransUnion fulfills its legal obligations. Attached to this complaint, please find the supporting documentation, including the original disputes, proof of payment for the auto loan, and my current credit report reflecting the erroneous information.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Account Information : Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date of Charge XXXX Amount : {$0.00} Despite providing clear evidence of the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account and requesting its removal from my credit report, Transunion has failed to comply with the law and has retained the inaccurate account information.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act mandates that if a reinvestigation does not resolve a dispute, the credit bureau must delete the disputed information within five business days. The repeated failure of Transunion to adhere to this requirement is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) and has caused me financial harm and distress.

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take immediate action against Transunion for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate deletion of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Ttransunion upholds its obligations under the law.

Please note that a simple e-Oscar 2-digit code readout will not suffice.

Regrettably, credit bureaus frequently rely on a mere software that fails to conduct exhaustive investigations, falling short of the legal standards for verification. Our legal team is keenly interested in understanding the process your investigators follow to reach their conclusions.

15 USC 1681 603 ( A ) ( 2 ) ( E ) The term investigative consumer report means a consumer report or portion thereof in which information on a consumers character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates of the consumer reported on or with others with whom he is acquainted or who may have knowledge concerning any such items of information. However, such information shall not include specific factual information on a consumers credit record obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from a consumer reporting agency when such information was obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from the consumer.

Verification means to make sure one actually owes the alleged debt, see XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). The definition of verification according to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is... averment that the party pleading is ready to establish the truth of what he has set forth. ... The examination of a writing for the purpose of ascertaining its truth ; or a certificate or af idavit that it is true.. The court said Confirmation of the correctness, truth, or authenticity of a pleading, account, or other paper, by an affidavit, oath, or deposition. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ; and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ; and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). 

I request a complete list of all documents and correspondence ( s ) with the original creditor, including, but not limited to : 1. The names and contact details of ALL employees involved in this investigation.

2. Concrete evidence tracing back to the original creditor ; and 3. Comprehensive information about the entire lifecycle of the loan.

4. The identity of the individual or entity that initially issued the loan.

5. The exact date when the loan was granted.

6. The original contact details associated with the loan.

7. Copies of all correspondence and documents sent in relation to this matter.

8. Copies of insurance contracts paying the creditor, securities held as a result of the contract, or tax benefits they have received from holding this account.

If an investigation can not be conducted or the required documents can not be located, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates the removal of the information from the credit reports, including the complete deletion of the account.

However, if an investigation of the account records can be carried out and inaccurately reported information is identified, it is necessary to update the credit reports to accurately reflect this information.

DEBT INVALIDATION NOTICE - Please find enclosed the correspondence sent to the alleged creditor. The absence of a validation response from the creditor automatically invalidates the account, serving as evidence of identity fraud. By law, this account must be expunged from the credit report. We request an updated credit report reflecting the resolution of the account dispute.

NOTICE OF FRAUD ALERT - This serves as a notice that you are now implicated in fraud by verifying information that can not be substantiated/ validated due to the absence of an authenticated contract with the creditor. If the agency fails to remove this information, we will be compelled to initiate legal proceedings for deliberate non-compliance under FCRA 616 and 15 U.S. Code 1681n.

OPPORTUNITY TO CURE - A point-by-point response to these demands in the form of an afidavit is legally required. As the XXXX, He who does not deny, admits, and An unrebutted affidavit stands as truth. According to Restatement 2nd 69, failure to respond within fifteen days will be taken as an admission that the debt is unverified, all legal claims are relinquished and are to be released, and the entity named on the account is a victim of identity fraud. If the debt is not verified, a demand is made to dismiss and withdraw the claim, and rectify any negative credit reporting that may have been associated with the alleged debt for all Credit Reporting Agencies ( CRAs ) and Credit Bureaus ( CBs ).

FINAL APPEAL TO AVOID LITIGATION - Legal proceedings can be costly and are best avoided. If necessary, I am prepared to represent myself in court and file a case in forma pauperis at no cost. However, I understand that your organization may need to engage an attorney, which could be expensive. This is so even if I choose to utilize Small Claims Court and require all claimants only, to appear with evidence and testify with first hand knowledge only. Therefore, this is a sincere attempt to settle this matter before resorting to litigation. I am open to resolving this issue in a private and amicable manner.

Thank you for your consideration and attention to this matter.

XX/XX/year> : XXXX XXXX XXXX approves a debt consolidation loan for me. Part of it is allocated to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$15000.00}, the exact amount I owe to XXXX. XXXX mails XXXX a check to their listed address at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX with my information on it. 

XX/XX/year> : XXXX XXXX sends me an email that my account is late being paid. I immediately respond to them via email and explain that a check was sent. 

XX/XX/year> : XXXX staff responds via email that they are checking to see if the check was received. 

XX/XX/year> : I receive an email stating XXXX is shutting down, and all account debts are being transferred to SST on XX/XX/XXXX. It also states XXXX will stop taking payments on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and all further payments should be directed to SST. I emailed XXXX XXXX and follow up to see if they have received the check, as I did not hear back from them prior. They tell me they have no more information to share. I press the issue and tell them if they have not received my check, I will have to cancel the check. 

XX/XX/year> : XXXX XXXX replies and says they have not received the check and to cancel it by contacting my bank or creditor. 

XX/XX/year> : I receive notice via email that my XXXX debt amount ( {$15000.00} ) has been successfully transferred to SST, and I get my account information. I contact XXXX Personal Loans to cancel the check they made out to XXXX  and have the same amount sent to SST, with all my new SST account info, via XXXX online inbox option. I get a reply telling me to call. I call XXXX XXXX XXXX customer service line, explain the situation to the representative, and give her my new SST information, along with their mailing address, so the new check can be sent to SST. 

XX/XX/year> : I am notified by XXXX via my secure inbox that the loan disbursement I asked to be sent to SST has been addressed to me directly. 

XX/XX/year> : I receive a check in the mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$15000.00}. This is highly confusing to me as I have them specific instruction to send the check to the creditor, SST. Thinking this may be an error on their part, I dont deposit the check. 

XX/XX/year> : SST deposits a mailed check in the amount of {$15000.00} to my account. The only proof I see is in my accounts transaction history ; there is no image of the check, check number, or where it came from. I notice the change to my SST account and believe XXXX sent a check to SST. 
My SST account states I still must pay {$490.00} in interest ( my payoff amount ). I deposit the check XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me via mobile deposit to my bank after checking the mobile deposit amount limits. The check clears in my account, but two holds- for two amounts adding up to the amount of the check- are placed on my account so the funds are not immediately accessible. 

XX/XX/year> : I notice the interest charge and write an email to SST noting that I should not be charged interest and that I will not be making further payments as they have been paid in full. I receive an automatic email reply to call SST during business hours. 

XX/XX/year> : I sent a follow up email response telling them my written correspondence should be sufficient information for them to close my account. SST calls me twice, and I do not answer. They leave a voicemail telling me to call them back. 

XX/XX/year> : SST responds to my email with a request to call them For your protection, Systems & Services Technologies , Inc. does not discuss individual account information via the internet. This policy prevents identity theft and secures your privacy. 

XX/XX/year> : SST calls me twice, and I do not answer. One of the calls has a voicemail telling me to call them back. I send them an email telling them to stop calling me and explain the situation in writing again. I tell them if the interest charge is not removed by XX/XX/XXXX, I will be calling. 

XX/XX/year> : SST calls me a combined total of 5 times from XXXX different phone numbers. I do not answer any of these calls. They do not leave voicemails. 

XX/XX/year> : SST sends me an email with an attached document - no password protection or login to my secure account necessary - stating the check they cashed had been returned. They had deposited the stopped check addressed to XXXX, and it was returned. 

XX/XX/year>, end of day : Both parts of the XXXX XXXX XXXX check are now clear and accessible in my checking account. 

XX/XX/year> : I deposit the amount of {$15000.00} to SST from my checking account. I receive a confirmation and keep record of it. 

XX/XX/year> : SST sends me a new monthly statement via email, with a new interest total of {$660.00}. SST calls me from a ( XXXX ) area code phone number. I do not answer, and they dont leave a voicemail.

2024-10-20,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction problem,,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text from what I thought was my bank, asking if I had authorized a wire transfer. I replied "" No '' and within seconds, my phone rings and caller ID said "" Bank of America '' so I answered. The man ( american accent ) said there was a suspicious wire transfer attempted from my savings account. To summarize, during the two hours I was on the phone with him, he said he was transferring all of savings balance to checking and locking that account. He said it wouldn't show up on my online dashboard and I logged in and sure enough, I didn't see anything and told him so. I asked name, which department and everything. He always had an answer and since my phone said BOA, I appreciated the lookout. While I thought I was on hold to talk to a fraud manager, he said he didn't want to make me wait any longer and that I would get a call back. When a few days went by, I called the bank to check on everything and found out that it wasn't the bank I was talking to. They helped me start a claim but said the since it was a wire transfer, I probably wouldn't get the money back. I went to a branch location to open new accounts since the accounts affected were for my business. The clerk sent me a security code while in his office and it came under the scammer message I had received. I showed him and he didn't know what to say. He said he had never seen a fraud impersonate the bank so deeply and even went on to suggest that the person was an EMPLOYEE or former employee because of all the knowledge this person seemed to have! He showed me the transfer on my transaction history and showed it went to a person called "" XXXX XXXX '' at XXXX XXXX. I got a letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX from the bank and they informed me they closed my claim and stated/claimed "" Our investigation found that the transaction in question was completed using a device that is consistent with previous valid account activity. '' So my conclusion is that the scammer hacked my device while on the phone and sent it from my online banking on my phone. I am begging you, please, please help me with the bank to get my money back. We have only banked with BOA since my wife and I got married in 2008.

The bank executive to whom I spoke stated that I should not fax any documents to the bank. At that time a fax number was published online to the bank branch. I was informed that XXXX XXXX no longer worked at the branch. I was also told that all heirs would have to appear at the branch simultaneously, with valid identification to have the meager sum of the check distributed to them.

Prior to the above attempts, after my parents passed away their joint succession was filed on XX/XX/XXXX.

The first transaction occurred in XX/XX/XXXX, where a total of {$3300.00} was withdrawn from my account. The second transaction took place in XX/XX/XXXX, amounting to {$1600.00}. Both transactions were conducted through ATM withdrawals and XXXX XXXX transfers, which I firmly did not authorize. 

During the time these transactions took place, I was in XXXX, and I provided proof of my situation to the bank. This included documentation of XXXX XXXX XXXX and confirmation of my address change. However, the bank 's denial letter claims that either I or someone I authorized made these withdrawals. It is critical to note that the banks policy clearly states that only the cardholder has access to the account, and I have never authorized anyone else to use my card. 

In light of this, I requested a list of authorized users on my account, only to be informed that no such users exist. The bank 's policy explicitly prohibits any additional users, reinforcing my assertion that I did not permit anyone else to access my funds. 

To further support my case, I have filed a report on identitytheft.gov, as well as a police report concerning my stolen California ID.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies.

6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim. There are numerous laws that states I have the right to opt out and you must comply or be in violation of {$1000.00} per incedent. I am giving you 4 days to consult with your legal team to verify everything I have stated and to delete all of my nonpubic, transaction history from all CRAs immediately. If you fail to comply, I am ready to take legal actions. Please verify with your legal team, under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions can face substantial fines for each instance of non-compliant disclosure after you have been advised to stop numerous times. The amounts could potentially reach up to {$100000.00} per violation. As a consumer whose private information is being disclosed without consent may be able to sue the financial institution for damages, including compensation for emotional distress and legal fees. Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance.

I trust you will take this matter seriously and resolve the issue promptly. Please provide written confirmation that my transaction history has been removed from XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX immediately. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

This bank then lowered my credit limit on Lowe 's, then closed the account, then upped the monthly payments to almost {$100.00} minimum per month just for that one Lowe 's card which is petty.

Today, I just got an email that they lowered my Sam 's Club credit limit too citing "" most recent delinquencies '' which is the 30 day late they reported.

During the transition our home burned down and we were displaced and not regularly receiving mail so I called in multiple times. We were sending payments in to freedom mortgage but it wasnt going to the correct department. We had no idea. They have provided an incorrect address twice in XXXX  years. They also adjusted our mortgage without our knowledge making the auto pay not be enough to cover. They have never been paid late, as all of our payments have been on auto draft from my bank. Ive been trying to resolve this for a year and Ive been sent to several escalation departments or supervisors but no action taken. Ive provided historic payments for 18 months showing money being mailed on the first of each month. When reviewing with customer service they acknowledge that the payments did come in but were not processed timely due to them being in the wrong desk of freedom mortgage. The supervisor corrected the address with my bank for future payment but refused to modify the adverse reporting. He also share that there was some type of late charge that had been carried over from a previous mortgage when they took my loan. Ive never been told of that but its whats been reported as over 90 days late and transfers month to month. Im in dispute about the {$440.00} late fee and refused to pay it with clear explanation to validate it. That could not be provided. We have over XXXX in equity in our home and recently experienced life altering circumstances forcing us to request equity. Because the the adverse reporting, we are unable to access our equity and when trying to get away from Freedom mortgage, no one will take us due to the late payment reported. The supervisor I mentioned advised me to report this to the credit bureaus and even gave their address and process for adverse reporting. He said he was looking in the notes and could clearly see the problems but was not able to modify on his end but the investigation would show it when they called and it should be corrected.

I immediately notified my son XXXX, as his USAA accounts are linked to mine, and informed him to work with the bank when they called, I had no idea that these people were bad actors and my XXXX XXXX XXXX did as I instructed. The fraudsters got hold to all my accounts this included my son XXXXXXXX XXXX accounts which were linked to mine as well as another banking institution. Within the hour I called USAA back because after multiple attempts I could not access my account, this is when the bank notified me they knew this scam was occurring and locked the accounts. The fraudsters were able to get my sons XXXX and withdrew {$2800.00}. USAA refuses to acknowledge that this was fraud and said the charge was authorized even though they know it was fraud there was no more than XXXX in both mine and my son 's accounts at the time, so fraudsters wired in {$2500.00} and withdrew {$300.00} from my account and {$60.00} from XXXXXXXX XXXX account ending in ( XXXX ) and now want us to pay it back. 
During the XX/XX/XXXX phone call the real USAA representative opened a case on the same day and informed me they knew of this scam and that it's ( 2 ) different individuals working in tandem, why were consumers not notified? I received Permanent Credit Issued letter 's dated XX/XX/XXXX, confirming that our accounts were credited back the money that had been stolen, only to have that decision reversed on XX/XX/XXXX without notice or evidence for the change. I placed a call to the bank requesting information about the decision and was told that this was an authorized transaction, but would not provide evidence of such, they said that my son 's XXXX of {$2900.00} was used for "" good 's and services ''. I disputed the charge my son was informed by the fraudster that his XXXX that was attached to his checking account was also hacked and asked him to change his credentials he did not authorize criminals to steal money he didn't have. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from USAA called a Debt Validation Notice stating that I now owed the {$2800.00} so I called the bank on XX/XX/XXXX, the bank to dispute and was informed that the original representative did not classify the fraud properly and they would escalate to the dispute team once again. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a written dispute to USAA via fax and priority mail again requesting that our accounts be restored as this was fraud. I received a call on XX/XX/XXXX from USAA stating that the case had been reviewed again and they saw the fraud and would again credit the accounts. I have requested for my son 's accounts to be closed and again was reminded it would be 30 days before they could close the accounts.

2024-10-20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","I sold my home on XX/XX/scrub> 2024. The buyers assumed my home mortgage loan from Flagstar Bank on this date. The title company and my realtor stated that I would receive a check in the mail 4-6 weeks after the closing date for an XXXX XXXX. That time has passed and I opened a case with the mortgage company on XX/XX/XXXX to see when my check would arrive. 

Flagstar Bank admitted to sending the check to the property that was sold on XX/XX/XXXX, instead of my new residence. They stated my new address was not on the paper work to send the check to, which is incorrect. They have my new address and I know this because I received the loan assumption and release of liability notice/document nearly two weeks after the sale closed. 

Flagstar opened a case to investigate this matter and they told me the issue would be resolved with a new check sent out to no later than XX/XX/year>2024. 

On XX/XX/scrub> 2024, I received an email from Flagstar Bank regarding my case and that it had been closed. The email did not contain the resolution, so I called them to find out. The representative that I spoke with stated my check was being sent to my new address that day and I should receive it in 3-5 business days. That time goes by and I call them again on XX/XX/year>2024 and asked where my check was. They stated that I should expect it in the mail no later than Friday XX/XX/year>, due to the bank holiday that prior Monday. 

That time and went again, so I called Flagstar and they told me that the check was sent to the sold property on XX/XX/year>2024 and it was cashed by the buyers of the property. Flagstar stated that the check was sent in the buyer 's name and not mine to the property address. The buyer called Flagstar and opened a case on XX/XX/year>2024 and asked what the check was for. A Flagstar representative told them it was a surplus check and they could cash it. 

On my end, no notice was sent to me regarding this cashing of the check. Flagstar willingly told the buyer that they could have this escrow refund. Then two different representatives of Flagstar told me I would receive my check in the mail ( NOTE : they do not send checks with a tracking number either ).

I spoke with a new Flagstar representative and their customer service management on XX/XX/year>2024 who stated that they need to check with the assumptions department to find out what happened and see how I can get my escrow refund. They did not give me a timeline as to when OR if this issue will be resolved. 

In summary, Flagstar Bank sent my Escrow Refund check to the buyer of my previous home, in their name. That buyer cashed that check with Flagstar 's approval. Flagstar told me twice that I would receive a new check at my new address and in my name. Flagstar then told me the new check was never sent, as the first was cashed by the buyer of the home.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANCORP INC,CO,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10509510

The repeated failure of Equifax to adhere to this requirement is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) and has caused me financial harm and distress.

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take immediate action against Equifax for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate deletion of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Equifax upholds its obligations under the law.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution and your assistance in rectifying this issue.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33157,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10508702

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Formal Request for Removal of Nonpublic Information and Violation Notice For Account Number XXXX Dear American Express, This is my final notice to formally request the removal of my nonpublic and transaction history to be deleted from XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, also know as credit reporting agencies immediately. I am enforcing my consumer rights and privacy to what can and can not be shared with non affiated third parties. Any rights that was inserted into the terms of the credit card agreement at time of application, I am revoking any and all permissions to share anything about me and my experience with your financial institution. 
Below is why I am requesting all of my transaction history to be deleted : 1. As a financial institution you must provide an initial notice to each customer explaining their privacy policies and practices regarding nonpublic personal information when the account was initially established and annually.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

3. As a financial institution you have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of your customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of our nonpublic personal information. You have not done that and have share my information to various non affilates.

4. As a financial institution you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ( credit reporting agencies ) any nonpublic personal information without my written consent.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies.

6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim. There are numerous laws that states I have the right to opt out and you must comply or be in violation of {$1000.00} per incedent. I am giving you 4 days to consult with your legal team to verify everything I have stated and to delete all of my nonpubic, transaction history from all CRAs immediately. If you fail to comply, I am ready to take legal actions. Please verify with your legal team, under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions can face substantial fines for each instance of non-compliant disclosure after you have been advised to stop numerous times. The amounts could potentially reach up to {$100000.00} per violation. As a consumer whose private information is being disclosed without consent may be able to sue the financial institution for damages, including compensation for emotional distress and legal fees. Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance.

I trust you will take this matter seriously and resolve the issue promptly. Please provide written confirmation that my transaction history has been removed from XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX immediately. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

2024-10-20,Credit card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"All I can tell you is I have had problems logging into the website because I have more than XXXX retail account that is managed by the same bank and it makes saving login information a nightmare. And since paperless billing is strongly encouraged and sometimes even costly if not signed up for, the inability to login is exactly like operating with zero account access other than any email and text notifications signed up for in the beginning. So without access to detailed billing information, I was shocked to learn recently that XXXX dollars in my monthly payments were allocated to the balance subject of deferred interest. I was informed that since I did not make special arrangements to allocate specific funds over and above the minimum payment amount each month to be used for paying off the portion of the total amount owed subject to the deferred interest month in incremental payments over the period of time that the interest is being deferred, then all the interest that is accruing during that time period will be added to the card balance all at once. So the ~ {$800.00} charge with 24 months of deferred interest payments that has already accrued nearly {$200.00} in interest so far, will continue to accrue interest until the end of the 24 month period, which by then will amount to {$600.00} or more, UNLESS I make special arrangementsright awayto add almost {$60.00} to each of my normal monthly minimum payments for a total exceeding more than twice my current monthly payment amount, and what is most disturbing is not so much everything I already mentioned because this aint my first XXXX XXXX by shady lenders, its the fact that the whole thing started with me going to the retail store, being offered a discount for applying for a credit card, being approved, and then having that item I purchased on a deferred interest plan, yet my card limit well exceeded that purchase, and NEVER ONCE BEING ADVISED THAT IT WAS UP TO ME TO MAKE THE SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS AS EXPLAINED ABOVE.

SoFi wasted my time for more than a month, making me think I was approved for this loan. My goal of this loan was to pay off a 27 % loan. SoFi wasted my time for 30 days and should be held liable for wasting my time and interest on this loan, and since it seems they had no interest in actually funding this loan, should remove the hard inquiry",,"SOFI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",CA,94601,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10517940

2024-10-20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I have done my banking and trading at Charles Schwab for more than two decades. My checking account was involved in a scam/fraud incident in XXXX. Charles Schwab shut down my account for more than two weeks to investigate the specifics of the fraud against my account. When my account was reopened by Schwab Bank it had a negative balance of approximately - {$4500.00}. 

Because I could not access my Schwab checking account, I opened a new account at XXXX XXXX  to reestablish my checking outside of Schwab. I intended to use the two Social Security deposits made within the two-month look-back period to set up my account at XXXX XXXX. 

Charles Schwab Bank refused to allow me access to my Social Security deposits, as required by law for Federal Benefits deposits made within the two-month lookback period. Banks must protect Federal Benefits deposits made electronically during the two-month lookback period. They refused to do so, saying the deposits were in my account when the fraud occurred. That is not an exception to the law requiring them to protect the Federal Benefits deposits and provide the account owner with unfettered access to those funds. 

Charles Schwab Bank released my XXXX Social Security Administration deposit saying it was not deposited when fraud occurred. Nevertheless, I still can not access my XXXX Social Security funds deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My Social Security deposits are my sole source of income. My current checking account balance is about {$400.00} and is supposed to last until XX/XX/XXXX. That is not doable given my obligations to pay apartment rent, electricity, gasoline, and groceries over the next 25 days. This would not be my circumstance if Schwab Bank was held to their federally required obligations to obey Federal law requiring them to protect my Social Security deposits made electronically within the two-month lookback period and allow the account owner unfettered access to the Federal benefits funds. 

I need help getting access to my Social Security benefit deposited to my Schwab checking account on XX/XX/2024, for {$3100.00}. 

I also encourage regulators to quantify the other Federal benefit deposits to other accounts receiving Federal benefits at their Schwab Bank accounts where those accounts may have been or have been involved in fraud. Based on my experience with Schwab, I imagine the number of depositors affected may be significant. If they ask Schwab to provide access to their Federal benefit deposits they are told "" no '' because the funds were deposited when the scam/fraud occurred. That is knowingly blatant disregard of the Federal laws that lay out specifically Schwab 's obligation to protect and provide access to Federal benefit deposits in the owners ' account ( s ). 

I would appreciate a prompt response from you and your agency about this matter. I have few groceries on hand, gasoline is below a quarter of a tank, and I need to pay for my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

My desired outcome is to allow me prompt access to my XX/XX/2024 Social Security deposit of {$3100.00} so I can move that deposit to my new checking account at XXXX XXXX.

2024-10-20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Unable to open an account,"I am submitting this complaint to report a series of discriminatory practices by Bank OZK that have caused my wife and me significant emotional and financial distress. I strongly believe the banks actions were motivated by XXXX and religious bias, resulting in the unfair treatment of my wife, a XXXX immigrant, and the eventual closure of my account. This behavior is not only unacceptable but appears to violate federal laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ).

Key Details : 1. Initial Interaction ( XX/XX/year> ) : On XX/XX/year>, I visited the Bank OZK branch in XXXX, XXXX, with the simple intention of adding my wife to my existing account. My wife had recently received her work authorization card, and we were excited to take this next step. When we met with the banker, XXXX, her demeanor became visibly cold and uncomfortable once she realized my wife was XXXX and an immigrant. Despite my request to simply add my wife to the account, XXXX proceeded to ask a series of irrelevant and inappropriate questions, such as how long my wife had been in the country, where she worked, and where her business was located. 
She also asked whether we were sending money abroad and specifically mentioned XXXX and the XXXX. I explained that I have been using XXXX for business purchases, just as I have for over a year, and that there had been no new changes to my account activity. Despite this, XXXX continued to ask strange questions and even stated that she had never handled anything like this before. Her tone was XXXX, and it became clear that she was uncomfortable with our request. 
XXXX. Document Requests and Email Exchange ( XX/XX/year> ) : The next day, XXXX contacted me requesting additional documents, including our marriage certificate and lease, which I found unnecessary for simply adding my wife to the account. Nevertheless, I complied and sent the requested documents, along with a note clarifying that I only wished to add my wife to the account and was not requesting any other changes. 
XXXX responded with an email stating that the bank was questioning wire activity related to foreign transactions. I clarified that I do not send money using wire transfers but make business purchases through platforms like XXXX and XXXX, just as I have done over the past year. Despite this explanation, XXXX responses remained dismissive, and the questioning felt unjustified and discriminatory. 
Concerned by these interactions, I contacted Bank OZKs corporate office to raise my concerns about potential discrimination. After a XXXX hour investigation, a corporate representative called me back, apologized for the inappropriate questions, and reassured me that everything was resolved. I was told there would be no further issues. 
XXXX. Account Denial ( XX/XX/year> ) : Despite the reassurances from corporate, XXXX contacted me the next day to inform me that the bank had decided not to add my wife to the account. No reason was provided. When I requested an explanation, XXXX was unable to offer XXXX, and after some time passed without a follow-up, I sent an email expressing my belief that federal laws, including those prohibiting discrimination, had been violated. Shortly after, the branch XXXX contacted me but was similarly unable to provide a valid reason for the denial. 
During this conversation, I expressed how distressing this situation was and how incidents like this make it scary and dangerous for Muslims to live in XXXX. The branch XXXX, clearly upset, hung up on me. This response further demonstrated the dismissiveness and lack of regard for the seriousness of my concerns. 
XXXX. Attempted Check Withdrawal and Debit Card Issuance ( XX/XX/year> ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my paycheck and decided to visit the XXXX branch instead of the XXXX branch to avoid further conflict. When I arrived, I was informed by the banker there that corporate had instructed them not to cash my check or issue me a new debit card. The banker explained that Bank OZK no longer wished to do business with me due to unspecified risks. When I requested a copy of the email from corporate that contained these instructions, I was told that it could not be provided. 
I also asked if I could withdraw the almost {$XXXX} I had in my account, but the banker said she was unable to do that either. I left the branch feeling confused and deeply concerned about the safety of my funds. 
XXXX. Withdrawal of Funds and Closure Letter ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Bank OZKs customer service line to update my address, as I wanted to ensure that my remaining balance would be sent to the correct location. However, I was told that no one at the bank was authorized to speak with me, and I was directed to email any further concerns. Later that day, the branch XXXX from XXXX called me and said I could come in to withdraw my funds, which I did. I was assisted by a banker, XXXX, who had known me from previous visits. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX sent me an email containing an official letter regarding the closure of my account. The letter claimed that my account would be closed on XX/XX/year>, and that I had until that date to withdraw my funds. This directly contradicted the fact that I was denied access to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, a full 10 days before the official closure date. The banks actions are inconsistent and raise serious concerns about the true motivations behind this account closure, particularly when combined with the inappropriate questions and tone of my previous interactions. 

Additional Steps Taken : I have also contacted the Council on American-Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) to seek support regarding the discriminatory treatment my wife and I have experienced. Additionally, Congresswoman XXXX XXXX XXXX office has expressed interest in the matter and indicated that they would pursue a congressional inquiry upon my filing a formal complaint with federal agencies. Furthermore, I have reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX office, as I am aware of her involvement with the CFPB and her previous work addressing issues Muslims face in the banking sector. 

Why This Matters : This experience has left my wife and me feeling deeply marginalized and discriminated against. I strongly believe that we were treated unfairly due to my wifes religious and XXXX background, as well as our XXXX faith. The inappropriate questions, the denial of service without reason, and the sudden closure of my accountall of these actions point to discrimination.",,BANK OZK,GA,30165,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10517425

2024-10-20,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I booked an hotel room online for one room, at the XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, XXXX for 2 nights, totaling {$240.00}.

I had my daughter call the hotel earlier that afternoon ( on the day we were to check in on ) and she spoke with a gentleman who had an accent.

She explained to him our situation and asked him if we were to arrive after midnight, would our room still be reserved and would we be able to check in upon arrival still? He stated yes that we would. He also stated that he was "" typing it into the notes under our confirmation # and that way there would be no issues. '' Upon arrival ( XXXX ), I walked up to the front desk to approach the XXXX lady ( XXXX ), when a man walked up after me yet right in front of me while I'm standing to be assisted next. Even though she watched this take place, she assisted the XXXX gentleman regardless. She was being incredibly nice to him. However, once I walked up to the desk, again, not only did she make me wait for an extended period of time but she was aggressive and very rude to me.

When I tried to explain to her that my daughter called the hotel earlier that same day and spoke with a gentleman who had a thick accent, and that he stated that he included what we spoke about and us checking in late in notes under our confirmation number, she stated : "" sorry, but we've already booked out your room since you didn't show up or call before midnight. '' There was no reasoning as to why she did this except that it's because I was a XXXX  female that she had issues with. XXXX ( who stated that she was a manager at that hotel ) continued to be aggressive and rude.

When I stated that it makes no sense why she's acting the way that she is and stating our room was booked, when we called many hours ( that afternoon ) before arrival, and when I had booked that room for a total of 2 nights, she stated : "" you need to leave the premises as you have no room here. '' She stated that I would be refunded when she "" had a chance to issue a refund. '' I ended up leaving but not until I requested a manager above her in which she stated "" I am the manager and there is no one above me. '' I left the hotel livid.

My daughter and I had to scramble to find another hotel that was close enough to where we would be going later that day but also not booked up and a room that we could reserve a room for the 2 nights needed. Thankfully, we found one, even though it was now 15 minutes away. By the time we got our room reserved, we received only 3 hours of sleep in total, before we had to get up to go to the appointment set up for that same day.

When I arrived back at my home and I didn't see a refund issued by the XXXX XXXX, I decided to reach out to my credit card company ( Goldman Sachs ), issued as an Apple credit card I decided to go ahead and dispute the charge, since I never received what I paid for ( 2 nights for 1 room ). They gave me a provisional credit while it was being investigated and until it was resolved. 

The very first dispute was in XX/XX/year> ( I believe that's the date it started on ).

Since then, my credit card company has reversed the provisional credit so many times ( at least 8 times ), and since then I have been disputing this charge for over a year now. Goldman Sachs 's refuses to issue me a permanent refund for the total amount ( {$240.00} ) that I spent on a product/service ( hotel room ) that I never received ( or for that matter refund me for any amount ). I have submitted sufficient documentation showing the amount of {$240.00}, with which I should have received back.

They continue to state that they never received documentation from me, even though I continued to send it each an and every time.

So, I decided to call the credit card company and I spoke with a representative who transferred me to a manager ( supposedly ). This person I was transferred to was very kind to me.

He stated that I could send the documentation to him ( while he stayed on the phone with me ), to make certain that my document arrived to the company and he stated that he would attach it to the dispute requested ( once again ).

Even though he did this for me and stated he received the documentation, I continued to receive emails from Goldman Sach 's stating that I need to submit documentation. So, once again I submitted the documentation.

After I sent what was asked for, I would then receive a email stating that the company was reversing my provisional credit, due to lack of documentation needed.

So, I called back once again and went through all of it over and over, time and again. This has went on for over a year now.

I'm fed up and frustrated and this is why I have decided to reach out to consumer finance, all in hopes of finally getting this resolved.

I will attach the same documentation to this form that I was sending to Goldman Sach 's each and every time. If there is additional documentation needed, please don't hesitate to reach out and let me know.

However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating that my rebuttal was denied, and no credits would be issued. 

I am extremely frustrated by the misleading information I have received. As a loyal customer and someone who works in banking, I expect a transparent and fair resolution.

However, XXXX marked the package as delivered at XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, but to XXXX XXXX, XXXX completely different location. I never received the package at my address. I immediately contacted XXXX and Home Depot to resolve the issue. 

Following my complaint, XXXX conducted a thorough search for the package and has since declared it lost, as documented in the attached claim status from XXXX. Despite XXXX confirming that they were unable to locate the package, Home Depot has repeatedly closed my claims without providing any resolution, refund, or replacement. Furthermore, Home Depot has never contacted me to inform me that my claim was being closed, nor have they provided any results or status updates on their investigations. I only discovered this when I followed up on my own. 

Currently, I have a balance of {$430.00} on my Home Depot credit card, which includes {$300.00} for the missing dishwasher. This amount is due by XX/XX/XXXX, as part of a promotional balance. I am being charged for a product that I have not received, and despite the clear confirmation from XXXX  that the package is lost, Home Depot has failed to remove the charge or provide a replacement. 

This is a breach of my consumer rights under both the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), which protects consumers from being charged for goods they did not receive, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) if these charges remain unpaid and affect my credit. 

I am requesting immediate intervention from the CFPB to ensure that Home Depot either provides a full refund for the lost item or sends a replacement. Additionally, I ask that any associated charges be removed from my Home Depot credit card and that my credit score remains unaffected by this unresolved issue.

Because my name is common in my home country so they have alot of girls with same name here in XXXX too. Whenever any company report about any account, transunion just match my name with someone else and put the inquiry on my account. I have been loyal customer for last 5 years and i do not have any loan and debt on my name. But due to some other girls who are not paying their bills and they have same name as me which causes me alot of problems. Last month, i had same inquiry on my credit report i contacted transunion and told them that i can see additional account inquiry for cibc with current balance {$140.00} which does not belong to me. I sent them my documents including my XXXX statement but they gave me result that information is accurate and account belongs to me and they decreased my XXXX XXXX to XXXX.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Formal Request for Removal of Nonpublic Information and Violation Notice For Account Number XXXX Dear Shellpoint Mortgage, This is my final notice to formally request the removal of my nonpublic and transaction history to be deleted from XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, also know as credit reporting agencies immediately. I am enforcing my consumer rights and privacy to what can and can not be shared with non affiated third parties. Any rights that was inserted into the terms of the credit card agreement at time of application, I am revoking any and all permissions to share anything about me and my experience with your financial institution. 

I have sent several notices with a list of XXXX documents to validate the debt but was only sent the loan documents, the note ( not the stamped paid in full copy ) and I requested a signed, certified penalty under purjury affadavit to validate their claim they loaned me money and validate the loan wasn't satisfied at closing. I have yet to receive all requested documents. Instead, they tried to foreclose. 


Below is why I am requesting all my transaction history to be deleted : 1. As a financial institution you must provide an initial notice to each customer explaining their privacy policies and practices regarding nonpublic personal information when the account was initially established and annually.

2. You must have permissable purposes in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I did not give you permission to report my transaction or nonpublic information about my experience with you.

3. As a financial institution you have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of your customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of our nonpublic personal information. You have not done that and have share my information to various non affilates.

4. As a financial institution you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ( credit reporting agencies ) any nonpublic personal information without my written consent.

5. You have never provided to me a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing or in electronic form on when the reporting of a late payment would occur before the time that such information is initially disclosed. Which would allow me the opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed to the credit reporting agencies.

6. As a financial institution, you are obligated to disclsose to your customer as to how they could opt out. I was never sent an explantion on how to exercise my nondisclosure option.

As a financial instition you may feel you have a right to report any and all information about my experience with you but there is no law that supports your claim. There are numerous laws that states I have the right to opt out and you must comply or be in violation of {$1000.00} per incedent. I am giving you 4 days to consult with your legal team to verify everything I have stated and to delete all of my nonpubic, transaction history from all CRAs immediately. If you fail to comply, I am ready to take legal actions. Please verify with your legal team, under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions can face substantial fines for each instance of non-compliant disclosure after you have been advised to stop numerous times. The amounts could potentially reach up to {$100000.00} per violation. As a consumer whose private information is being disclosed without consent may be able to sue the financial institution for damages, including compensation for emotional distress and legal fees. Be advised, any officer or director of the financial institution may also face personal penalties for violations, including fines up to {$10000.00} per violation. Therefore, there is the potential for criminal penalties for intentional or egregious violations brought against the institution or individuals involved, potentially leading to imprisonment. If I do not receive a favorable response within 4 days, this notice will be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) to take enforcement actions against your institution for non-compliance.

I trust you will take this matter seriously and resolve the issue promptly. Please provide written confirmation that my transaction history has been removed from XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX immediately. My next step is to file my lawsuit to show the securities fraud, breach of contract and compel them to enter all requested documents into discovery to prove my claim.

This statute lays out the procedures for disputing a billing error and the obligations of the creditor when handling such disputes. 

A creditor shall not, prior to the end of the time period allowed for payment of undisputed amounts, report that an amount or amounts in dispute under this section are delinquent because the amount or amounts remain unpaid. ( 12 CFR 226.13 ( e ) ) Regulation Z, part of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), governs the time of payment and ensures transparency in credit and billing practices. It includes rules on dispute resolution, billing error correction, and the time limits for creditors to respond. 

The payment due date must be clearly disclosed, and any penalties for late payments must be specified.

2024-10-20,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I am writing to file a follow-up complaint regarding XXXX  unsatisfactory handling of a fraudulent transaction on my account, which has contributed significantly to my current financial hardship. While XXXX eventually took action to resolve the dispute in XX/XX/year>, this response was both inadequate and excessively delayedparticularly considering the dispute was first raised between XXXX and XX/XX/year>. Fidelitys eventual resolution, while addressing the fraud, came far too late to mitigate the financial damage I have experienced as a direct result of their failure to act within a reasonable timeframe. 
Background I initially reported a fraudulent charge on my XXXX account in XX/XX/year>. Over the course of several months, I was given conflicting information, mishandled at various stages, and advised inaccurately about the steps I should take to resolve the matter. Multiple opportunities for XXXX to resolve this issue in a timely manner were missed, causing undue financial strain as I was forced to bear the cost of the fraudulent charge and associated interest. It wasnt until my complaints were escalated to both the CFPB and the Attorney General 's office that XXXX acted to resolve the fraud dispute in XXXX XXXX timeline that is entirely unacceptable given the nature of the claim and XXXX  fiduciary duties. 
Unsatisfactory Outcome While XXXX finally reimbursed me for the fraudulent charge, this outcome remains far from satisfactory. The months-long delay in resolving the issue has caused significant financial hardship in several ways : 1. Delayed Reimbursement : The prolonged period between when the fraud occurred and when XXXX reimbursed the charge meant that I had to account for the fraudulent charge while managing my regular financial obligations. Although XXXX ultimately handled the interest related to the fraudulent charge, I was still unable to pay off my balance in time due to the extended presence of the fraudulent charge on my account. This led to a ballooning balance during that time, which further compounded the financial difficulties. 
2. Interest Accrual on Legitimate Charges : While the fraudulent charge itself was eventually addressed, my inability to pay down the full balance in the interim resulted in significant interest accrual on other legitimate purchases. These charges would not have incurred such high interest had XXXX resolved the dispute promptly, allowing me to properly manage my balance. The ongoing interest accumulation on legitimate charges continues to worsen my financial situation. 
3. Credit Impact ( Potential ) : Though this situation has not yet resulted in missed payments or derogatory marks on my credit report, the rapidly increasing balance due to accrued interest has left me in a precarious position, making it increasingly difficult to manage payments going forward. If this situation remains unresolved, the risk of missed payments and a negative impact on my credit will rise, especially as the ballooning balance threatens to overwhelm my ability to make timely payments. 
XXXX 's Failures at Every Step XXXX 's failures at every step of this processfrom their mismanagement of my fraud complaint, to their lack of timely communication, and their disregard for the financial consequences their delays causeddemonstrates negligence and bad faith. The inordinate delay in processing the dispute does not excuse their responsibility, and a mere "" resolution '' months after the fact is insufficient to address the harm caused. It should not take the involvement of the CFPB and the Attorney General for XXXX to act in accordance with their legal obligations. 
Ongoing Financial Hardship As a direct result of XXXX failure to promptly resolve this matter, I have been left in a financially precarious position. Specifically : The delayed reimbursement led to missed payments on other financial obligations, as I was forced to divert funds to cover the fraudulent charge. 
Multiple 0 % APR credit cards taken out during this period have since come due, leaving me with skyrocketing monthly payments that are impossible to manage. 
My business startup has also suffered significant losses due to my inability to manage the debt caused by XXXX failures, with first-year losses likely to exceed {$50000.00}. 
My financial position has deteriorated to the point where I can no longer qualify for a debt consolidation loan, which could have helped alleviate the escalating debt situation caused, in large part, by XXXX 's negligence. 
The current interest rates on credit card debt are far higher than historical averages, compounding my financial struggles and further preventing me from making timely payments.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,IN,473XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,10517574

It was a small amount and generally would be transferred in a day or two. The never transferred from Marcus to XXXX but I did see that the transaction was reversed ( or didn't go through ). 

I didn't really think much of it and funded my money from a different account and went on with life. 

Fast forward to about XX/XX/year> and I saw that my account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX charged me for an insufficient funds fee when I had a monthly payment deducted from that account but didn't have enough money to cover it. Upon further investigation I realized that Marcus by Goldman Sachs hadnt sent my pre-existing setup monthly transfer from Marcus to XXXX. 

I called Marcus to let them know about this issue I saw and they told me my account was frozen. I said how can you freeze my account without notifying me about it by making a warning message or alert when I logged in to their account online either via web or their app. They couldn't explain it other to say "" we called you but you didn't answer ''. 

I told them I never received a call and didn't think it was right they could freeze my account without making me aware of them doing that since I had been a customer for many years and I had a monthly transfer setup to XXXX for about 1-2 years without prior issues. 

I asked them to refund my fee from XXXX since it was their fault they didn't transfer my money. They asked me to get the following information and mail it to them, which I did : Statement, my last name, purpose of fee, etc Goldman Sachs bank USA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Case : XXXX ** Mailed on Tuesday XX/XX/year> from XXXX XXXX They ended up denying my request for reimbursement.

I voice my frustration with the person on the call but literally felt like Goldman Sachs is making XXXX  of dollars in their banking services but can't even refund a long time customer for a fee that was the direct result of an action they took on my account without successfully notifying me of an issue.

2024-10-20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"Navy Federal Credit Union Attention : Checking and Savings Collections Operations Department XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, VA XXXX Subject : Formal Dispute of Overdrawn Account and Request for Removal of Collection Account Account Number : [ Account Ending in XXXX ] To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute the outstanding balance of {$460.00} on my Navy Federal Credit Union checking account ending in XXXX. This dispute is made under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1666 ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ).

I believe this balance was wrongfully placed in collections due to unsupported claims of unauthorized debit card transactions made on XXXX XX/XX/year> for {$1100.00} and on XXXX XX/XX/year> for {$930.00}. These claims were denied without sufficient investigation, despite my continued efforts to resolve the issue. As a result, I am disputing the collection on the following legal grounds : 1. Insufficient Investigation of Disputed Charges : Under Regulation E ( Electronic Fund Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693 ), XXXX XXXX is required to investigate any unauthorized electronic funds transfer disputes properly. I provided all necessary information regarding the unauthorized transactions, and I request further details and evidence used to deny my claims. If XXXX XXXX can not provide evidence to support the denial, these transactions should be reversed, and my account should be corrected.

2. Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : Per the FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ), creditors and their representatives must ensure that the debts they report are valid and legitimate. Reporting a debt that includes charges resulting from unsupported or fraudulent transactions constitutes a violation of the FDCPA. I request that XXXX XXXX promptly remove this collection account and refrain from reporting the debt to any third-party agencies, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

3. Right to Correct Inaccurate Information ( Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) : As you are aware, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information. XXXX XXXX decision to deem my account a loss is based on incomplete investigation and an unsupported decision regarding the unauthorized transactions. Therefore, the reporting of this debt is inaccurate. I demand that XXXX XXXX promptly remove this collection from its records and from any consumer reporting agencies to which it has been submitted. 

4. Right to Documentation and Proof : I formally request all documentation related to the denied claims of {$1100.00} and {$930.00}, including transaction logs, investigation details, and communications. If this information can not be provided, the claims should be considered unsupported, and my account should be reinstated to its original status. 

Conclusion : Based on the aforementioned laws and my rights as a consumer, I request that XXXX XXXX remove the outstanding balance of {$460.00} from collections immediately and correct my account. Additionally, I request confirmation in writing that no negative information has been reported to any credit or consumer reporting agencies, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Please respond to this dispute within 30 days of receipt, as required under federal law. Should this matter remain unresolved, I am prepared to pursue further action with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) or seek legal recourse.

Attached you will find a copy of my credit report with the disputed items highlighted for your review. 
Specifically, I am contesting the following entry : RESURGENT/LVNV FUNDING Account # XXXX Dispute Item and Explanation : Permissible use violation, reporting to a third party inaccurate Private and personal Information, not providing original documentation of consumer relationship/debt or promise to pay, or contract. 

As mandated by state and federal laws, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I demand that you provide verifiable proof of this alleged debt. It has come to my attention that you have already contacted a third party regarding this matter, which is a blatant violation of the FDCPA. This misconduct is unacceptable and further undermines your credibility as a debt collector. 

I hereby instruct you to immediately cease all collection efforts until you have furnished adequate verification of this debt. You are also directed to refrain from contacting any third partiesincluding my employer, neighbors, or family membersabout this collection. All future correspondence must be conducted in writing and sent directly to me. 

Furthermore, I assert that any reporting of this matter to credit reporting agencies is premature. You are required to halt any negative reporting until you have thoroughly investigated my dispute. If any negative information has already been reported, you must notify the credit bureaus to remove such information pending the outcome of your investigation. 

Your next communication with me must either confirm that the creditor has failed to verify the debt and that the matter is closed or provide solid proof of my responsibility for this debt. If you assert that the debt is valid, I expect a comprehensive explanation for your refusal to remove it from collections, along with copies of all relevant documents, including applications, bills, communications, and payment records. 

I expect your acknowledgment of this notice within 14 days. Failure to comply will leave me no choice but to escalate this matter to the appropriate regulatory authorities and seek legal recourse.

Before my home sold, we secured an approved transfer of the loan to the buyer ( the process itself was very difficult and the company tried to deny the buyer of the home multiple times without explanation ). After we received an approval, we submitted the transfer and assumption paperwork and our home sold to the buyers a few days later. In XXXX I received notification that the account was in collections in my name, and the company denied ever issuing the approvals even though we have everything in writing and on company letterhead, and emails! They said they issued a denial via mail without informing any of the parties involved in the home sale, days after issuing the approval and only two days prior to when our home was set to be sold to out of state buyers. After I spent countless hours on the phone and via email attempting to resolve this, I am at a standstill. Since XXXX, the company accepted their approval of the loan, and transferred to the buyer. My credit report is still affected almost 90 days later, and as of last week this debt was temporarily removed. This week, the debt was reinstated on my credit report as belonging to me after I submitted a dispute directly with the credit bureau. My credit score was negatively impacted by at last XXXX points for the last 4 months minimum, and it's caused an incredible amount of stress, I've not been able to refinance my student loans or even open up a new high yield savings account. An account executive confirmed last week XX/XX/XXXX on the phone that in order for it to be re-instated on my credit report, it needs to be confirmed by the company that the information is accurate ( meaning they reinstated the debt and missed payments as belonging to me ). The company also fraudulently back dated the payoff dates in my payment portal to show the loan was paid off XX/XX/XXXX, which is at 10 days before our home sold, to cover up this entire situation. I have proof that this was not done until at least XX/XX/XXXX ( this account view that I downloaded shows the debt on my portal, delinquency letters, etc ). Multiple times throughout this process I requested proof of submission of the correction sent to the credit bureaus, and nothing was provided. The company refused to take accountability for this situation or attempt to resolve this. The account executive I spoke with XX/XX/XXXX had empathy, but also acknowledged this ridiculous situation as something that should never have happened. I have filed formal reports on the company 's website, with the IL Attorney General, with the XXXX, and now with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I have spent an incredible amount of time trying to resolve this myself ( over XXXX hours of work XXXX, phone calls, emails, report filings, consultations with lawyers ) when it should have never been my situation to begin with, it's caused an incredible amount of stress and damage to my financial situation the last 6 months.

Account Information : - Account Number : XXXX - Creditor Name : XXXX - Date of Charge Off : XX/XX/year> - Amount : {$0.00} The account in question is an auto loan that was reported as charge off but has been paid in full. Despite providing documentation in previous disputes that demonstrates the inaccuracies of this information, TransUnion has failed to remove it from my credit report. Additionally, this account is reported solely by TransUnion and not by other credit bureaus, which further indicates an error in the reporting. 
The FCRA requires credit bureaus to delete disputed information within five business days after the reinvestigation if the dispute is not resolved, as stipulated in 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ). The continued presence of this incorrect account on my report violates the following FCRA provisions : 1. 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) - Credit bureaus are legally required to ensure maximum accuracy of the information they report. The fact that this charge off appears exclusively in TransUnions report suggests that TransUnion has failed to verify the accuracy of its data.

2. 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) - TransUnion is required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when the accuracy of any item in the report is questioned. The failure to correct the disputed information after two attempts constitutes a violation of this obligation.

TransUnions lack of compliance has caused significant financial damage and emotional distress, impacting my ability to access credit fairly. I request the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly and take the necessary actions against TransUnion for its continued non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

I am seeking the immediate deletion of this inaccurate account from my credit report and any other remedies deemed appropriate by the CFPB to ensure that TransUnion fulfills its legal obligations. Attached to this complaint, please find the supporting documentation, including the original disputes, proof of payment for the auto loan, and my current credit report reflecting the erroneous information.

2024-10-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by TransUnion Dear CFPB, I am filing a formal complaint against TransUnion due to multiple violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) in relation to the reinsertion of inaccurate and unauthorized information into my credit report. Additionally, the credit reporting agency failed to provide or request documentation I specifically asked for during the dispute process, compounding their non-compliance with the FCRA. 

Background Information : Credit Reporting Agency : TransUnion Disputed Account : Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/year>, I disputed this account on the grounds of inaccuracy. Following the dispute, Transunion deleted the account from my credit report, as confirmed in writing on XX/XX/year>. However, upon reviewing my most recent credit report on XX/XX/year>, I discovered that the same inaccurate and unauthorized information had been reinserted.

FCRA Violations : Failure to Notify of Reinsertion : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( ii ), a credit reporting agency must notify the consumer within five business days if previously deleted information is reinserted into the credit report. I was not informed of this reinsertion.

Failure to Obtain Certification of Accuracy : Before reinserting the disputed information, TransUnion was required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( i ) to obtain certification from the furnisher that the information is accurate. No such certification was provided. 

Failure to Provide Furnisher Information : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( iii ), the agency must provide the name, address, and phone number of the furnisher of the reinserted information. This was not done. 

Failure to Ensure Accuracy : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) mandates that credit reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information. By reinserting inaccurate information, TransUnion has violated this provision.

Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation : As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), credit reporting agencies are obligated to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information. Reinserting inaccurate data without verification shows a failure to comply with this obligation.

Failure to Provide or Request Documentation : Throughout the dispute process, I specifically requested documents verifying the accuracy of this account, as well as contact information for the original furnisher of the data. TransUnion Reporting Agency failed to provide or request this documentation, demonstrating further non-compliance with FCRA standards.

Requested Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate and unauthorized information from my credit report. 
Written confirmation that this information has been permanently removed and will not be reinserted unless in full compliance with the FCRA. 
Full disclosure of the source of the reinserted information, including the furnishers name, address, and phone number. 
An updated copy of my credit report reflecting these changes. 
Explanation of why the requested documentation was neither provided nor requested from the original furnisher. 
The reinsertion of this inaccurate and unauthorized information has caused me significant harm, including a lower credit score and emotional distress. The violations committed by TransUnion have impacted my ability to obtain favorable financial terms. I request that the CFPB take immediate action to investigate this matter and ensure that the credit reporting agency is held accountable for these serious breaches of the law.

I have attached copies of my original dispute letter, the deletion confirmation, and a copy of the new dispute.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and any actions you will take to resolve this issue.

I tried in the past 3 to 4 days to make an international wire transfer in USD but Bank of America is giving me error message ( online or in person at the branch ). I tried to do the wire transfer to multiple international banks in 2 different countries. all gave me the same error message. 
The bank error reads "" we are unable to process your request. if your beneficiary is able to receive a different currency, you may try again with that currency. we apologize for the inconvenience "" When I try to do the same international wire transfer in the foreign currency of the receiving bank, it works fine. ( no error messages ). and only shows the exchange rate of Bank of America for that currency.

Facts : 1 ) Bank of America ( both online and in person ) denying my wire transfers in USD to foreign bank accounts.

2 ) I tried multiple different foreign banks in 2 different countries.

3 ) all the foreign bank accounts are in USD. so the money will be received and handed internationally in USD.

4 ) all my attempts resulted in the mentioned error message.

5 ) Bank of America ( online and in person ) only allowed me to proceed with the international wire transfer, if I indicate the amount to be sent internationally in the local currency of the recipient bank.

6 ) multiple Bank associates told me ( in person and on the phone ) that the error message is because the recipient bank is not communicating their fees to Bank of America. therefore Bank of America can not proceed with the transfer because it can not disclose the international bank fees as required by federal law in the U.S.

7 ) when I tried to do the international wire transfer in the local currency of the recipient international bank. Bank of America failed to disclose any type of fees of the recipient bank. but only showed bank of America exchange rate to that currency.

8 ) I called Bank of America and spoke to 3 agents who failed to give a straight answer to why I can not send foreign wire transaction in USD to foreign bank account ( account in USD ) as I did many times in the past. they only said laws changed.

9 ) if laws changed, why does the option to wire internationally in USD, still available ( online and in person ).

I checked my phone and messages and confirmed I had not been called. He said to give them more times to call and they would call me back. In indicated that was the exact same thing they said last time and that I didn't believe him that they had called me previously so I didn't trust it this time. He said he was sorry I was unsatisfied with his resolution, said someone would call me back, and hung up on me. 

The above is highly annoying but it's not why I am contacting the CFPB. What happens next is downright fraud : After being hung up on, I immediately called back, when through all the rigamarole to get to someone who could look at my case. I started fresh, indicating that I had expected a return call in XXXX or XXXX business days but no call had come and I wanted to know the resolution. This new person opened my case and said "" I can see we spoke to you on XX/XX/XXXX and explained why the bill wasn't paid and the case has been closed. '' I was outraged. Clearly the person who had just hung up on me had altered my file after he spoke to me. Instead of saying "" they tried to call you '' the message was now "" we spoke with you on XX/XX/XXXX and have now closed the case. '' This is fraudulent. My phone records will prove it and Chase will not be able to find a recorded conversation with me on XX/XX/XXXX. The new person indicated that we should open a new case to pursue the answers to the questions I still had ( which is why wasn't the bill paid- I don't believe that it has anything to do with me being in XXXX and have no idea why that would impact my auto payment. So, a new case is established and I am waiting for resolution. 

However, my reason to coming to the CFPB is because of the man who hung up on my who altered my file by saying we had a conversation on XX/XX/XXXX and closing the case. 



The Reference number for the first case : XXXX ( This is the XXXX where I was told that the bill may not have been paid because I was in a high risk country ( since when is XXXX high risk? ) and where the man told me they tried to contact me and then hung up on me then altered the file to show that they HAD reached me and then closed the case. ) The second case which we opened fresh to address the original complaint is : Case number : XXXX",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,VA,229XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10517083

The alleged debt is beyond the statute of limitations for collection under Maryland law, which is three years. The statute of limitations does not restart when a debt is sold or transferred to another collection agency, meaning their continued collection efforts are unlawful. 

The following are clear violations of federal and state consumer protection laws : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) ( FDCPA ) : The company has failed to provide the written contract or any validation documentation proving that I owe this debt, as required by the FDCPA. Without validation, they have no legal grounds to collect or report this debt. 

15 U.S.C. 1681n ( FCRA ) : By failing to ensure the accuracy of the information reported and continuing to report this account without proper validation, the company and the credit bureaus ( XXXX and XXXX ) are in violation of the FCRA. They may be held liable for negligence and non-compliance. If willful, these violations could result in liability for actual, statutory, and punitive damages. 

12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ) : The company has failed to provide necessary validation information before reporting this collection account to my credit report, as required by federal law.

12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ) : I was not given the opportunity to dispute this account before it was reported to the credit bureaus, which violates my rights under federal law.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) : The company lacks the authority to report this account to consumer reporting agencies without providing all required disclosures and debt validation. 

In addition to federal violations, the company is also in violation of Maryland consumer protection laws : Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act ( MCDCA ) : The company has engaged in unfair and deceptive debt collection practices by failing to validate the alleged debt and continuing collection efforts.

Maryland Financial Institutions Article, 11-301 & 7-101 : The company is not licensed to engage in debt collection or lending activities in Maryland, as required by law. Conducting such activities without the proper licensing is illegal.
