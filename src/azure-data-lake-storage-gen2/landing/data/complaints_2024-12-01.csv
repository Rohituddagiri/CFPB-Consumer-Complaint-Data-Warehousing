XXXX decision to deny my credit application appears to be in direct violation of the ECOA, which prohibits creditors from discriminating against any applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance ( 15 U.S.C. 1691 ).

Additionally, the ECOA and its implementing regulation, 12 C.F.R. 1002.9, require creditors to provide a specific reason for a denial of credit in a timely manner. XXXX either failed to provide an explanation or provided an insufficient explanation that does not comply with these legal standards. 

Furthermore, under the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1602 ), XXXX is obligated to disclose credit terms transparently and in good faith. Denying credit without valid reasoning undermines my rights under this statute and suggests non-compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1611, which prohibits creditors from knowingly failing to provide accurate disclosures or following legal obligations.

Legal Basis 15 U.S.C. 1691 ( ECOA ) : This provision prohibits discrimination and mandates clear, timely communication of reasons for credit denial.

12 C.F.R. 1002.9 : Requires creditors to issue a written statement detailing specific reasons for denying credit or informing the applicant of their right to request this information within 60 days.

15 U.S.C. 1602 & 1611 ( TILA ) : These provisions ensure that lending practices are conducted transparently and that any denial is justifiable and communicated effectively.

12 U.S.C. 1431 : This section governs federal oversight of lending practices and ensures that financial institutions operate in compliance with public and consumer protection laws. 
Harm Caused The denial of credit has caused significant harm to me, including : Inability to meet my financial needs and goals due to lack of access to credit. 
Adverse effects on my creditworthiness and potential opportunities for future credit.

I was dismayed to find that an item that had previously been removed by two other credit reporting agencies has been re-verified by your agency. This has raised serious concerns for me, as the other agencies concluded that the item was unverified and subsequently deleted it from my credit report. 

It is important to note that these items in question are a result of identity theft, which has caused significant distress and harm to my mental, emotional, and physical well-being. I find it deeply troubling that despite the clear evidence of fraudulent activity associated with this debt, your agency has chosen to not adhere to the regulations that mandate the validation of such debts. 

I must emphasize that the inaccuracies in my credit report are not only detrimental to my financial standing but also tarnish my reputation and creditworthiness. I urge you to promptly rectify this issue and ensure that the erroneous item is removed from my credit report in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

I kindly request that you conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and provide me with a detailed explanation as to why the item has been re-verified despite the lack of validation from other reporting agencies. It is imperative that this issue be resolved expeditiously to prevent further harm to my credit profile.

Issue : The account in question, a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX installment account, has been reported on my credit file by Equifax as "" charged off '' but simultaneously reflects an outstanding balance of {$9600.00}. This reporting practice is in clear violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which mandates that consumer reporting agencies ensure maximum possible accuracy in the information contained within a consumer report. 

A charge-off designates the account as a loss for the creditor, written off for profit-and-loss purposes, and no longer considered collectable. However, it is inconsistent and misleading to maintain both a "" charge-off '' status and an outstanding balance simultaneously.

Recently, I observed that my XXXX XXXX dropped by over XXXX points, despite no changes to my credit report, no new accounts being added, and no inquiries being made. Upon reviewing my report, I found no explanation for this significant decrease. This sudden drop appears arbitrary and unsubstantiated.

This raises serious concerns about XXXX compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates that consumer credit reports must be accurate and that consumers are entitled to a clear explanation of changes in their credit scores. By failing to provide transparency and accuracy, Experian is engaging in practices that I believe are fraudulent and harmful to consumers. 
Moreover, I have reason to believe that XXXX practices disproportionately XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, particularly XXXX and XXXX individuals, who are often unfairly targeted or penalized in credit reporting.

I additionally asked Atlantic Bay, to provide me with detailed documentation as to whether it had securitized this loan in the Non-Negotiable Notice of Debt Validation Request.

One of Atlantic Bay 's communications was "" Since your mortgage loan with Atlantic Bay was sold to a third party on XX/XX/XXXX, Atlantic Bay would not be the party to send this form '' /request.

Another of Atlantic Bay 's subsequent letters sent me a letter on XX/XX/XXXX, stating it had sold my loan in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX. 
I have asked the mortgage company to provide documentation about the sale of that loan transaction. 
XXXXntic Bay has repeatedly sent misguided information with the intent to delay, deny, and confuse us the consumers from obtaining the true and accurate information of the Loan it says it provided.

Throughout this whole process that has been a 12-month journey Atlantic Bay has continued to provide inaccurate information on the loan, it has not provided us the name, address, and contact person of the entity it says purchased my loan, nor has it ceased collection efforts to include setting a date for a DEED Of Trust Sale ( XX/XX/XXXX ) after it clearly stated in its letters dated XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX that it had sold the mortgage. 
The Mortgage and DEED are documents that require assignments and court filings if they are transferred, reassignment, or subsequent change of ownership.

Atlantic Bay has not provided any of the required notices to me the consumer of this kind of transaction concerning my mortgage and deed.

Atlantic Bay does not possess the standing in my opinion to take a lawful action of foreclosure or Deed of trust sale if it does not hold/own both the Mortgage and the Deed.

Some of the requests in this Administrative Procedure with Atlantic Bay were to consider Rescission and start over since it had failed to provide clear and concise relevant information in this contract. Since Atlantic Bay failed in its responsibility to provide relevant disclosure concerning the Securitization, Sale, and Trading of my financial assets ( NOTE and DEED ) without my knowledge then Rescission is necessary and being claimed by me. 
I sent Atlantic Bay at least two Non Negotiable Notices of Rescission on XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX. I subsequently received a letter from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, informing me that they were retained by Atlantic Bay to respond to my NOTICE of Right of Rescission dated XX/XX/XXXX and received by Atlantic Bay. Telling me that my right to rescind expired on XX/XX/XXXX, without further addressing the disputes associated with my claim. I responded by sharing with the Law Firm, a letter that I received from Atlantic Bay, Noticing that it had received my request for Rescission well in advance of the XX/XX/XXXX date my alleged right to rescind has expired. 
Case law states that UNTIL the required disclosures have been provided to the consumer then the clock on the consumer 's right of RESCISSION does not start. Additionally, I will provide a XXXX XXXX to obtain information on the Securitization, Sale, possible Funding, and active trading of a XXXX  Number created during the Mortgage Back Securitization and offers associated with the loan in question with Atlantic Bay.

Atlantic Bay has delayed, provided misinformation, and failed to provide the full disclosure that it is required to provide while lamenting they have been overloaded with requests that take up their valuable time after responding to my requests they label as bothersome and without merit.

The attachments and Atlantic Bay 's acknowledgment of the sale of the Mortgage, the securitization of the loan, and the sale of the deed of trust together reveal that Atlantic Bay lacks standing to take any action on me except to return the deed and Note to me free and clear with prejudice.",,ATLANTIC BAY MORTGAGE GROUP LLC,VA,23434,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-03,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10983867

2024-12-01,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Account number XXXX Subject : Formal Dispute Regarding Negative Item and Violation of Federal Laws To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute an inaccurate and unlawful negative item listed on my credit report. I believe this entry is not only incorrect but also reflects a violation of several federal consumer protection laws. Below, I outline the violations and request immediate action to investigate and rectify this matter.

1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1635 ( Right of Rescission ) : Under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), I am entitled to specific disclosures and protections regarding financial obligations. This law provides a right to rescind certain transactions within a specific timeframe. The negative item on my report does not reflect that this right was properly honored or communicated.

2. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( Validation of Debts ) : As per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I have the right to request validation of any alleged debt. Despite my requests for verification, I have not received adequate proof that the negative item on my report is valid or accurate. This failure constitutes a violation of federal law.

3. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( Communication Practices ) : The FDCPA also regulates the manner and timing of communications regarding debt. Any communication about the disputed item must comply with the prescribed standards, including restrictions on contacting me without consent or at inappropriate times. I believe these standards have not been adhered to.

4. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( Compliance with Accurate Reporting ) : The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates that credit bureaus maintain strict procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information reported. The presence of this negative item, which I have reason to believe is inaccurate or unverifiable, indicates a failure on your part to comply with these obligations.

Requested Resolution : 1. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and the removal of the disputed negative item from my credit report.

2. Please provide me with the purchase agreement verifying the accuracy and legality of the information in question, as required by federal law.

3. Confirm in writing that the disputed item has been removed or corrected within 30 days of receiving this letter.

Failure to address this matter adequately and in compliance with federal laws may result in further action, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursuing legal remedies. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious matter. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter and keep me informed of your actions regarding this dispute.

This credit dispute is being submitted as a notification of creditors who are in violation of the CARES Act during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The accounts that are being disputed, are either in violation of the CARES Act or do not belong to me. Policy states...

Statement on Supervisory and Enforcement Practices Regarding the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V in Light of the CARES Act The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection ( Bureau ) recognizes the serious impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the financial well-being of many consumers and on the operations of many supervised entities, including actors in the consumer reporting system, and the challenges of this unique and rapidly evolving situation. Last Friday, on XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( \ '' CARES Ad\ ' ), which provides critical emergency assistance to consumers and businesses affected by COVID-19 and includes provisions addressing consumer reporting requirements.

Consumer report information is critical to consumers and industry in determining who obtains credit, insurance, and housing, and at what price, and who obtains employment in many cases. Consumer reporting has enormous reach, as evidenced by the over XXXX XXXX consumers in the United States who have credit files and trade lines furnished by over XXXX providers. The continued operation of the consumer reporting system will play a critical role in the functioning of the consumer financial services market, promoting fair and efficient access to credit and benefiting consumers and creditors alike. The Bureau understands that the current crisis impacts the financial well-being of consumers and poses operational challenges for consumer reporting agencies and furnishers, accommodation, the furnisher report the credit obligation or account as current; or ( Il ) if the credit obligation or account was delinquent before the maintain the delinquent status during the period in which the accommodation is in effect; and ( bb ) if the consumer brings the credit obligation or account current during the period described in item ( aa ), report the credit obligation or account as current\ '' ). In addition, section XXXX of the CARES Act addresses the furnishing of certain student loans for which payments are suspended. Rendering them unable to investigate consumer reporting disputes within the timeframes the FCRA requires. Furnishers include a wide variety of businesses that vary in size and sophistication and can range from small retailers to very large financial services firms, each of which will face unique challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In evaluating compliance with the FCRA as a result of the pandemic, the Bureau will consider a consumer reporting agencies or furnisher\ 's individual circumstances and does not intend to cite in an examination or bring an enforcement action against a consumer reporting agency or furnisher making good faith efforts to investigate disputes as quickly as possible, even if dispute investigations take longer than the statutory timeframe. The Bureau reminds furnishers and consumer reporting agencies that they may take advantage of statutory and regulatory provisions that eliminate the obligation to investigate disputes submitted by credit repair organizations and disputes they reasonably determine to be frivolous or irrelevant. 
The Bureau will consider the significant current constraints on furnisher and consumer reporting agency time, information, and other resources in assessing if such a determination is reasonable. 
Regulatory Requirements This Policy Statement is a non-binding general statement of policy articulating considerations relevant to the Bureau\ 's exercise of its supervisory and enforcement authorities. It is therefore exempt from the notice and comment rule making requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act pursuant to 5 USC 553 ( b ). Because no notice of proposed rule making is required, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not require an initial or final regulatory flexibility analysis. See 5 USC 603 ( a ), 604 ( a ). The Bureau has determined that this Policy Statement does not impose any new or revise any existing record keeping, reporting, or disclosure requirements on covered entities or members of the public that would be collections of information requiring XXXX approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these account without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( XXXX ) responsible for creating these accounts. 
I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn\'t have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these account accounts/items doesnt belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

Policy states...

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT \ '' FCRA\ '', Section 1681c ( 2 ) Block of information resulting from identity theft.

1. Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than four ( 4 ) business days after the date of receipt by such agency of...

All furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies must comply with all applicable regulations. Information about applicable regulations currently in effect can be found at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus website, www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION : OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA A list of tile sections of tile FCRA cross-referenced to the.U.S Code is at the end of this document.The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is available at the website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore Section 623 imposes the following duties upon furnishers : Accuracy Guidelines results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain files on a nationwide basis. Section 623 ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnished information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when .it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ).

Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumers file. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the slime delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to \ '' XXXX '' consumer reporting agencies, as defined in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA . Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ). The CFPB has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 1022, App. B.

Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing XXXX XXXX, products, or devices ( and such furnisher\ 's agents or assignees ) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information.

Duties When ID Theft Occurs Including staffing challenges, that could temporarily impede their ability to timely comply with their statutory and regulatory consumer reporting obligations. 
The Bureau is therefore issuing this policy statement ( Policy Statement ) to highlight furnishers\ ' responsibilities under the CARES Act and inform consumer reporting agencies and furnishers of the Bureau\ 's flexible supervisory and enforcement approach during this pandemic regarding compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Regulation V. The Bureau intends to consider the circumstances that entities face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and entities\ ' good faith efforts to comply with their statutory and regulatory obligations as soon as possible. The Bureau believes that this flexibility will help furnishers and consumer reporting agencies to manage the challenges the current crisis poses. It also will enable consumers, as well as lenders, insurers, employers and other consumer report users, to maintain confidence in the consumer reporting system.

Below are examples of the flexibility the Bureau intends to provide in the consumer reporting system.

Furnishing Consumer Information Impacted by COVID-19 : The Bureau reiterates its prior guidance encouraging financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers and other customers affected by COVID-19 to meet their financial needs. While companies generally are not legally obligated to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies, the Bureau encourages them to continue furnishing information despite the current crisis. Furnishers\ ' providing accurate information to consumer reporting agencies produces substantial benefits for consumers, users of consumer reports, and the economy as a whole.

The CARES Act, a section of which amends the FCRA, generally requires furnishers to report as current certain credit obligations for which furnishers make payment accommodations to consumers affected by COVID 19 who have sought such accommodations from their lendersl .The Bureau expects furnishers to comply with the CARES Act and will work with furnishers as needed to help them do so.

Many furnishers are or will be offering consumers affected by COVID-19 various forms of payment flexibility, including allowing consumers to defer or skip payments, as required by the CARES Act or voluntarily. Such payment accommodations will avoid the reporting of delinquencies resulting from the effects of COVID-19. The Bureau supports furnishers\ ' voluntary efforts to provide payment relief, and it does not intend to cite in examinations or take enforcement actions against those who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies that accurately reflects the payment relief measures they are employing.

Disputes : The FCRA generally requires that consumer reporting agencies and furnishers investigate disputes within 30 days of receipt of the consumer\ 's dispute. The 30-day period may be extended to 45 days if the consumer provides additional information that is relevant to the investigation during the 30-day period.

The Bureau is aware that some consumer reporting agencies and furnishers may face significant operational disruptions that pose challenges for them in investigating consumer disputes. For example, some consumer reporting agencies and furnishers may experience significant reductions in staff, difficulty intaking disputes, or lack of access to necessary information, 1 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Pub. L. No. 116-136, 5 4201 ( 2020 ) ( stating that, with certain exceptions, \ '' if a furnisher makes an accommodation with respect to 1 or more payments on a credit obligation or account Of a consumer, and the consumer makes the payments or is not required to make 1 or more payments pursuant to the The below listed accounts by the Original Creditors, who have reported these accounts within my credit reports, were not opened by me. I also did not give my authorization for anyone else to open these accounts. Someone else of who did these that I did not know.

These original creditors are being reported incorrectly, and/or the accounts do not belong to me.

Policy States According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy ( a ) Reinvestigation of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required a. In general. Subject to Subsection ( f ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly thorough a reseller, of such dispute free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means to you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 
Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRES that are a result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed and companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquires. 
Inquires that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit, it is a fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquires are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquires were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 
It should be noted that any inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done though fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry with each company. These inquires are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 
I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit reporting agency, report an accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do mot belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be UPDATED and/or DELETED!

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"This complaint addresses serious and egregious violations of federal law committed by XXXX, XXXX, Experian ( the Credit Reporting Agencies or CRAs ), and XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX regarding their mishandling and unlawful reporting of my personal data, privacy breaches, and fraudulent classification of charged-off debts. Their actions not only infringe upon my statutory rights but also cause significant harm to my financial well-being and reputation.

Failure to Honor Opt-Out Rights Under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802 ) Under 15 U.S.C. 6802, consumers have the right to opt out of the sharing of non-public personal information ( NPI ). I am formally opting out of any prior or assumed authorizationswritten, verbal, implied, or otherwisegranted to the CRAs or XXXX And XXXX XXXX to use or share my data. Despite this clear directive, these entities have willfully disregarded my right to privacy by continuing to disseminate my XXXX without consent. 


XXXX. Violations of the Privacy Act of XXXX The Privacy Act of XXXX mandates that entities handling personal information must notify individuals of its use and provide them with a meaningful opportunity to restrict or control its dissemination. 

Violation : XXXX, XXXX, Experian, along with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX failed to notify me of how my personal information was being shared with third parties and denied me the ability to opt out of these unauthorized disclosures. 
Impact : This lack of transparency infringes upon my fundamental rights to control the use of my personal data.

3. Illegal Reporting of Charged-Off Debts as Income ( 15 U.S.C. 6801 ) Charged-off debts reported to the IRS via a 1099-C are reclassified as income under federal tax law. Income, however, is not permissible for inclusion on a consumer credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). XXXX, XXXX, Experian, and [ Bank Names ] are knowingly violating federal law by falsely reporting charged-off debts as derogatory items instead of removing them as required. 

Violation : The continued reporting of charged-off debts as derogatory trade lines violates 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), which governs the permissible content of consumer reports. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the court confirmed that debts reported inaccurately or without proper validation are unlawful under the FCRA. This precedent underscores that creditors and CRAs must remove such items promptly. 
Impact : This misclassification harms my creditworthiness and exposes me to undue financial hardship and damage. 



4.Negligence and Gross Misconduct by Each Bank and CRA Each of the following entities has engaged in illegal reporting and privacy violations : XXXX AND XXXX : Refused to validate a charged-off debt and continued reporting it despite being reclassified as income. 



XXXX, XXXX, and Experian : Complicit in reporting unvalidated, inaccurate, and impermissible information, including charged-off debts and transaction histories without my authorization. 



The actions of XXXX, XXXX, Experian, and XXXX and XXXX XXXX violate the following federal statutes and case law precedents : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S.C. 16811681x. 
Privacy Act of XXXX : Public Law 93-579.

A fraudulent account was illegally opened in my name without my knowledge or consent. Specifically, I have no recollection of applying for or authorizing the account with XXXX XXXX, and I am unfamiliar with its origin. This unauthorized activity has caused harm to my credit and financial reputation. 

I have taken immediate action by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and I have enclosed my Identity Theft Report as evidence of this crime. Additionally, I have contacted the credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) to request validation of the debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). However, the information I requested has not been provided, which further confirms the lack of legitimacy surrounding this account. 

The fraudulent activity violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which ensures the accuracy of information reported to consumer reporting agencies, and the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which makes the unauthorized use of my personal information a federal crime. 

I am requesting the immediate investigation and removal of this account from my records and credit reports to prevent further harm. Identity theft has impacted my ability to secure credit and maintain my financial well-being. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your cooperation in helping me resolve this issue. Please contact me if you require additional documentation or information.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX dispute This complaint is in regard to the account related to XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being reported to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX needs prior consent from either the court or the consumer before communication with the collection of any debt to a credit reporting agency. 
Notice, it is a fact, I the consumer did not give prior consent to communication to the debt collector, { XXXX XXXX XXXX } and the consumer alleges there was no prior consent from a court giving permission to contact I, the consumer in collection of any debts owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX and thus this communication by XXXX XXXX XXXX is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692c ( a ) without a court order brought forth. I did not consent to XXXX XXXX XXXX communicating with me any obligations to pay a debt through any mediums which includes communication with the credit reporting agencies to report the alleged debt. Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692a ( 6 ) 1692a ( 6 ) - a debt collector is defined as anyone in the business of collecting a debt. Therefore by definition XXXX XXXX XXXX is debt collector. 

Notice, it is a fact, that, I, agent for principal ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) am aware that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a debt collector by the legal definition. Pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692 ( a ) ( 6 ), a debt collector is any person who uses instrumentality of interstate commerce, such as the mails, in any business which the principal purpose is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another Furthermore this law U.S.Code 1692d states A Debt collector may not engage in any conduct ( no restriction ) which will harass, oppress or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt. Oppressing a right would be conduct not allowed from 1692d. Credit is the right granted and protected by federal law. If any debt collection caused a denial of credit this allows for damages. I have been denied credit on multiple occasions and denied housing because of this negative account on XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. This is an actual damage as this tremendously harmed my ability to operate in commerce and purchase household goods and shelter for I the consumer and my family. 

Notice, it is a fact, I the affiant is aware, credit is a right granted to me as a creditor under the Truth in Lending Act and { XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX } does not have the right to oppress or abuse any part of my character which would restrict or prohibit my right to extend credit. XXXX XXXX XXXX has oppressed my right to extend credit which is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692d.

Furthermore this law 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ) states the actions performed by XXXX XXXX XXXX was illegal- Communicating with any person false credit information including failure to communicate the debt is being disputed has not been verified. As well as there being no contract that exists bewteen the I the consumer and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX says I the consumer would pay XXXX XXXX XXXX the alleged debt this was false and misleading reporting. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware and has proof in this complaint of false and inaccurate credit information reported and it is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ). XXXX XXXX XXXX reported a debt collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report. I the affiant have disputed this debt this information can not keep reporting while the dispute is still not resolved as well as failing to communicate with the credit reporting agencies that the debt is being disputed and has not been verified by I, the consumer. This was very misleading and XXXX XXXX XXXX used this as a tactic to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting a fake debt while at the same time attempting to force me to pay the alleged debt under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting the negative collections account to my consumer report in doing so severely damaging my credit worthiness and my ability to operate in commerce and obtain household goods and shelter. I have been denied housing on multiple occasions leading to me being in a homeless shelter this is an actual damage to I, the consumer. I demand once again that XXXX XXXX XXXX fix this issue by deleting the account. XXXX XXXX XXXX is also in violation of 15 U.S. code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( I ) 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) - Reported information can not be only transactions and experiences between the consumer and a company. 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ) - The consumer must be given a chance to direct the information whether they want the information about a transaction they had to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, a consumer must be given a chance to direct whether they want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX doing so is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and this information must be removed.

I the consumer also know that it is a fact that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX the original creditor assigned the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The two debt collectors that reported the alleged debt and are attempting collect are XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Both debt collectors are attempting to force the consumer to pay under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting a collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report. In doing so both companies have severely damaged my ability to operate in commerce and use my right to credit. I the consumer have a right to credit and have had that right taken from me due to the improper use of my consumer report from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ) 1692e ( 12 ) - the assignee clause which makes the 3rd party debt collector and the one who assigns the debt liable. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX assigned the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX This means they are both liable for the alleged debt not I the consumer Notice, it is a fact, consumer has reason to be believe and do so believes, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are in violation in accordance to Article XXXX, the assignment of a defaulted note is illegal. Both the assignee and the assigned are both liable for violations under 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ). So I am actually not liable for this debt according to what the law says about the matter. 

The debt was assigned to XXXX XXXX XXXX they are attempting to collect a debt that they were assigned. XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX do not have any contract which contains my signature nor does a contract exists that states XXXX XXXX XXXX would pay XXXX XXXX XXXX any payment for a debt. 

There is no contract between the consumer and the debt collectors. This violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) which prohibits abusive, unfair, or deceptive debt collection practices ; if you are contacted by multiple XXXX for the same debt. Both XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX have both contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX in an attempt to collect a debt. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX had no right to sell the account without notice to i the consumer before doing so. XXXX XXXX XXXX also has no right to sell the debt because XXXX XXXX XXXX already received income from I the consumer. XXXX XXXX XXXX already received full payment of the debt. XXXX XXXX XXXX withdrew funds from my Social Security trust account. XXXX Treasury XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, with IRS Form 1099-A. The IRS accounting department can properly account for the transfer of these funds from this account to all debt accounts that I am said to owe or be in default. I also gave XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX interest when I signed the retail installment agreement. Due to this fact I, the consumer have no further obligations to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is no longer reporting any accounts to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report XXXX XXXX XXXX also violated 15 U.S.Code 1692j 15 USC 1692 ; 1692 - False and deceptive forms. A form which is made to believe the debt has something to do with you or you are obligated and you are not, is false and deceptive.

Fraud found in a form is a false and deceptive form and a violation of this act. For example if you go and get into an agreement as a consumer credit transaction, you went for something and gave credit. Companies are known to make what's called asset accounts. I never went to have an account made, this is a false and deceptive form because they never disclose this account being made. This includes statements which falsely accuses me of owing a debt. The delivery of these forms via mail constitutes mail fraud. I also never created an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX if I the consumer did not open the account then it is fraud. 

Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, there has been fraud found in this form shown in EXHIBIT ( - ). This form is therefore false and deceptive, void and a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692j I do not have a contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) 15 USC 16324010 ) 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) - Allows for any action of damage.

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) allows civil liability rewards for any damages, which may include stress, harassment, anxiety, mental anguish, and other damages all caused by violations of FDCPA due to XXXX XXXX XXXX abusive and deceptive business practices. Which caused I the consumer to be denied for housing and certain lines of credit. Which caused I the consumer to be in a homeless shelter and and unable to operate in commerce this is very XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore I am owed monetary value in the amount of XXXX $ for every single violation of the UNITED STATES CODES. 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - XXXX dollars for each proceeding. 
Notice, it is a fact, 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) states an individual action is a violation worth XXXX dollars for proceeding, however understand 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) these violations has caused actual damage By XXXX XXXX XXXX violating 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and not giving me a chance to direct whether I want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX so XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( XXXX ) I was damaged by this violation of the law XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX upon themselves to infringe on my right to direct the information I want reported regarding the transaction. Then hindering my ability to credit by reporting without my directions a collections account that negatively impacted my consumer report. 
Every violation of the law by XXXX XXXX XXXX caused a damage to I, the consumer. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX also committed identity theft. They obtained my identifying information such as my social security number to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting the fraudulent account. This use of my social security number was not authorized by I the consumer. XXXX U.S.Code 1644 ( a ) 15 USC 1644 ( a ) 1644 ( a ) - Fraudulent authorized use of a credit card such as a license plate, social security card, XXXX card etc, can result up to a XXXX fine. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, the fraudulent use of a credit card, by XXXX XXXX XXXX is defined as whoever uses, attempts or conspires to use a card to obtain money, goods or services shall be fined for {$10000.00} or imprisoned for 10 years or both. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX used my social security account number the exact number on social security card to report information to my consumer report and to collect on a debt. 
This is a direct violation of 1644 ( a ) Also note that this matter could become even more serious if this issues isnt resolved because according to 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) -If i win a civil suit and file a class action, i can obtain up to XXXX $ or 1 % of the company. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, If judgement is made against { XXXX XXXX XXXX } I, the affiant, can and will pursue class action for the amount of XXXX $ to 1 % of your company in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) meaning I could own a percentage of XXXX XXXX XXXX or receive XXXX $ for XXXX XXXX XXXX inconveniences to I the consumer. 

15 U.S.Code 1602 ( b ) 15 USC 1602 ( b ) 1602 ( b ) Bureau. 
The term Bureau means the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Consumer Reporting Agencies are not credit bureaus. The CFPB regulates the credit reporting agencies.

I urge the CFPB to work swiftly and diligently with me on this matter to make sure XXXX XXXX XXXX and the credit reporting agencies EXPERIAN and XXXX resolves this issue in a timely fair and equitable way for I, the consumer. As well as make sure they follow the laws that were set in place to govern them.

I apologize for this oversight and wish to clarify that the issues and accounts I am disputing remain unchanged. I am submitting this revised dispute to provide the correct documentation for your review. 

Investigation of Inaccurate Credit Report Items is in Violation Under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ( b ) Accuracy of report To Whom It May Concern, I recently conducted a review of my credit report and found several items that have caused me significant distress. These items appear to be unverifiable, inaccurate, and questionable. Your agency has failed to ensure the accuracy of the information as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports. This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. 

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report. 

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors. I have never entered into a valid contract with any of these entities, nor have I engaged in any transactions with them. As such, these accounts are fraudulent and may be the result of identity theft or other illegal activities. Attempting to enforce these fraudulent accounts is unlawful. I request that you expedite your investigation to prevent further harm, losses, or damages that I may suffer as a victim of identity theft. 

Moreover, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, my right to privacy has been violated, and this breach infringes upon my rights as outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974.

The vehicle was charged off in XXXX of XXXX by XXXX XXXX, However, XXXX XXXX continued with threatening collection activities to include threats of repossession of the vehicle all the way through XX/XX/XXXX. 

I never received a 1099c from XXXX XXXX for the charge off that they claimed on my personal credit report which is still showing today XX/XX/XXXX as a charge off on my personal credit report which is impacting my overall FICO score as a result of the incorrect reporting. 

I made an agreement with XXXXXXXX XXXX to pay an agreed upon balance they claimed was still owed on the vehicle although they received a tax credit from the IRS for the written off balance owed on the vehicle. The reason why I made the agreement was because XXXX XXXX continued to threaten collections and repossession of the vehicle until the balance they claim was owed was paid on the vehicle. Therefore I am requesting a 1099c from XXXX XXXX which they were supposed to have provided to me once the account was charged off. 

I paid the agreed upon amount they requested and still had to wait over 4 months from XXXX XXXX to release the title to my vehicle. XXXX XXXX has caused a great deal of stress upon me during my dealing with their customer support and other departments within this past year alone regarding the account. I no longer choose to do any type of business with XXXX XXXX ongoing in the future and at this point, I am requesting a copy of the 1099c from XXXX XXXX that they were supposed to have provided to me once the account was charged off, so that my taxes can be prepared properly. 

Based upon my personal credit report, the account was charged off in XXXX of XXXX, however, XXXX XXXX continued to go after collections on the account through XXXX which resulted in my paying an agreed upon amount to settle the debt that they stated that I still owed on the account, although they received a tax credit from the IRS for the charge off amount on the account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NC,27612,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10978267

It has come to my attention that you are reporting what I believe to be inaccurate data, which I dispute, and this letter is an appeal for your assistance.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to accurate, complete, and verifiable reporting. Below are the specific issues with this account : 1. Late Payments Reported on a Closed, Paid Account : Despite the account being marked as Closed with a {$0.00} balance and Current payment status, the payment history includes multiple 30-day late marks. If the account is paid and closed, late payments should not persist unless accurate and verifiable. 
2. Inconsistent Comments Across Bureaus : XXXX : Closed.

XXXX : Closed or paid account/zero balance XXXX. 
These comments are inconsistent and may mislead lenders about the resolution of disputes. 
XXXX. Failure to Properly Update or Resolve Disputes : Dispute-related comments remain on the account, even though it has been resolved and paid. This suggests a failure to update the status, violating the FCRAs accuracy standards. 
4. Inconsistent Reporting Across Bureaus : Minor discrepancies in dates, such as the Date Last Active and Last Reported dates, differ slightly among the bureaus. While this might seem minor, it reflects a lack of synchronization.

Reporting a bankruptcy as originating from the court without direct verification from the source violates this requirement.

Furthermore, under 15 USC 1681i, I have the right to dispute any inaccurate or unverifiable information on my credit report. Since the bankruptcy court does not furnish such information to credit reporting agencies, its inclusion on my credit report is unsubstantiated and must be removed.

Actions Requested : Conduct an Investigation : Investigate the source of the bankruptcy information reported on my credit report. If the reporting can not be verified directly by the source ( the bankruptcy court ), it must be removed.

Provide Written Confirmation : Notify me in writing of the results of your investigation and provide an updated copy of my credit report reflecting the removal of the inaccurate bankruptcy entry.

Ensure Compliance : Verify that all procedures are in compliance with the FCRA to prevent similar inaccuracies in the future.

Enclosed are supporting documents, including confirmation from the bankruptcy court that they do not furnish credit reporting data, and a copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed bankruptcy entry.

I expect a response within the 30 days required under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ). Failure to comply with these legal obligations will leave me no choice but to report this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my state Attorney Generals office.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Reporting and Request for 1099-C Documentation To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to dispute the accuracy of an account listed on my credit report. This letter is being sent under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC 1681s-2, which requires that furnishers of credit information report only accurate and verifiable information. 

The account in question is as follows : 1. Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Listed : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Account Name : XXXX XXXX Date Listed : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX  Date Listed : XX/XX/XXXX This account is reporting a balance despite the fact that such reporting may violate consumer law and IRS regulations concerning the discharge of indebtedness. 

According to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the issuance of a 1099-C form is evidence of an identifiable event of debt cancellation under IRS regulations . Specifically, Identifiable Event Code 7 states that a discharge of indebtedness occurs due to a decision by the creditor to discontinue collection activity and cancel the debt as part of a defined policy. 

If a 1099-C form has been issued for this account, it signifies that the debt has been canceled. Reporting a balance for a canceled debt is not only inaccurate but also misleading under the FCRA. This inaccurate reporting is damaging my credit and must be addressed immediately. 

Demands : Verification of the Account Balance : Provide evidence showing that the balance being reported is accurate and collectible. 

Provision of the 1099-C Form : If a 1099-C form has been issued for this debt, provide a copy of the document as proof of the identifiable event. 

Immediate Deletion of the Account : If the debt has been discharged under Identifiable Event Code 7 or can not be verified, this negative information must be promptly deleted from my credit report to comply with the FCRA. 

Under the FCRA, I expect your investigation to be conducted within 30 days of receipt of this letter. If you are unable to verify the accuracy of the information or provide the requested documentation, you are required to remove this account from my credit report. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your resolution and a written confirmation of the results.

Experian : Subscriber reports dispute resolved - consumer disagrees. 
XXXX : Consumer disputes after resolution ; closed or paid account/XXXX  balance. 
These inconsistent comments create confusion for lenders and XXXXay indicate unresolved disputes, despite the account being paid and closed.

2. Late Payment Reporting on a Closed Account : The payment history shows multiple 30-day late marks for a closed account with a {$0.00} balance. If the account is resolved and paid off, such marks should not appear unless accurate and verified.

3. Failure to Properly Update or Remove Dispute Comments : If the dispute is resolved, the comments section should reflect this. Leaving dispute-related remarks misrepresents the accounts current status. 
XXXX. Inconsistent Reporting Across Bureaus : XXXX uses inconsistent terms, reporting Closed or paid account/zero balance, while others simply state Closed or Paid. 
5. Inaccurate Reporting of Payment History : The presence of 30-day late marks on all three bureaus payment history while the account is current, paid, and closed with a {$0.00} balance could be misleading.

2024-12-01,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Formal Complaint Regarding Fraudulent Account, FCRA Violations, and Unauthorized Legal Actions by XXXX XXXX  To Whom It May Concern at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint against XXXX XXXX  concerning a fraudulent account opened in my name, improper reporting practices, violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), and unauthorized legal actions taken against me. 

Background and Timeline of Events : 1. Initial Identity Theft Incident ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : - While attempting to purchase a vehicle, I noticed a significant drop in my credit score. 
- Upon reviewing my credit reports, I discovered several unauthorized accounts opened without my knowledge or consent. 
- I promptly filed an identity theft report with the XXXX Police Department ( Report Number : XXXX ) and submitted a detailed complaint to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 

2. Implementation of Fraud Alerts ( XXXX ) : - To protect my credit, I requested and successfully placed a 7-year fraud alert with all three major credit bureaus : XXXX, Experian, and XXXX. 
- These alerts were intended to prevent any new unauthorized accounts from being opened in my name without stringent verification processes. 

3. Unauthorized XXXX XXXX  Account ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : - Despite the active fraud alerts, a fraudulent account was opened with XXXX XXXX  under my name, accruing unauthorized charges totaling {$7400.00}. 
- XXXX XXXX  records indicate acknowledgment of this account being fraudulent, yet no effective measures were taken to resolve the issue on their end. 

4. Improper Charge-Off Reporting : - My Experian credit report shows that XXXX XXXX  charged off the fraudulent account. 
- According to IRS guidelines, a creditor who charges off a debt is required to issue a Form 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) to the debtor. I have never received such a form from XXXX XXXX. 
- Furthermore, XXXX XXXX continues to report this charged-off account negatively on my credit reports, which is adversely affecting my credit score and financial reputation. 

5. Unauthorized Collection and Legal Actions : - Contrary to the acknowledgment of the fraudulent nature of the account, XXXX XXXX  initiated collection efforts against me. 
- A lawsuit was filed in an attempt to collect the alleged debt, resulting in a default judgment due to my unawareness of the legal proceedings. 
- These actions have caused significant stress, financial strain, and have unjustly held me responsible for a debt I did not incur. 

Violations Noted : - Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violations : - Failure to accurately report information and correct known errors in my credit file. 
- Continued reporting of a fraudulent account despite evidence and acknowledgment of identity theft. 
- Negligence in conducting a reasonable investigation upon notification of the dispute. 

- IRS Reporting Violations : - Failure to issue a Form 1099-C upon charging off the alleged debt, as required by IRS regulations . 

Impact on Me : - Financial Hardship : - Denial of credit opportunities and higher interest rates due to damaged credit. 
- Unwarranted legal fees and costs associated with defending myself against the wrongful lawsuit. 

- Emotional Distress : - Significant stress and XXXX  resulting from continuous collection attempts and legal actions for a debt I did not incur. 

- Reputational Damage : - Harm to my credit reputation, which affects both personal and professional opportunities. 

Steps I Have Taken to Resolve the Issue : - Provided copies of the police report and FTC identity theft report to XXXX XXXX. 
- Notified XXXX XXXX  of the fraud alerts placed on my credit files. 
- Disputed the fraudulent account with all three credit bureaus, attaching all supporting documentation. 
- Attempted to communicate with XXXX XXXX  's fraud department to resolve the issue amicably. 


Conclusion : The actions of XXXX XXXX have caused undue hardship and are in direct violation of federal laws designed to protect consumers. I kindly request the CFPB 's assistance in resolving this matter promptly to prevent further damage to my financial well-being. 

Attachments : - Copy of the XXXX Police Department Identity Theft Report. 
- FTC Identity Theft Affidavit. 
- Correspondence with XXXX XXXX  acknowledging the fraudulent account. 
- Copies of credit reports showing the erroneous entries and charge-off.

Specifically, I believe the following violations have occurred regarding my credit report : Inaccurate Reporting of Account Status - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) The reporting of my account status across different credit reporting agencies is inconsistent and inaccurate. For example, [ Name of Credit Reporting Agency ] lists the account as [ describe the status, such as "" Voluntary Repossession '' or "" Foreclosure '' ], while other agencies, such as [ list other agencies ], report different statuses, including [ list conflicting status reports ]. 
This inconsistency has led to confusion regarding the actual status of my account and has negatively impacted my credit score.

Failure to Report Accurate Payment History - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) The payment history reported on my credit report is inaccurate. [ Name of Credit Reporting Agency ] reports months as "" FC '' ( Foreclosure ) when the account was not in foreclosure during those months. This is incorrect, and the payment history is inconsistent with my actual payments. 
I request an immediate correction of this reporting, as it violates the FCRA 's requirement for maximum accuracy. 
Failure to Update the Balance After Repossession or Voluntary Surrender - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) My credit report continues to show an inaccurate balance of [ {$4700.00} ] after a repossession or voluntary surrender. I believe the balance should reflect the current status after the vehicle was sold, and any remaining deficiency balance should be accurately reported. 
Failure to update this information is a violation of the FCRA, which requires creditors to report accurate information regarding the balance of the account. 
Failure to Investigate Disputed Information - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) I have disputed the inaccurate information in my credit report with [ XXXX, XXXX, experian ] on [ XX/XX/2024 ], but no investigation or resolution has occurred. Under the FCRA, the agency is required to investigate and correct any inaccuracies within a timely manner. This failure to respond is a violation of my rights under the FCRA. 
Inadequate Debt Validation Information - Violation of FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) I have not received the proper validation of the debt from the creditor or collection agency. I have requested specific details regarding the balance, payment history, and original contract, but have not received a satisfactory response. 
Under the FDCPA, I am entitled to request and receive debt validation within 30 days of receiving a collection notice, which has not occurred. 
I expect a response to this complaint within [ 30 days ], in accordance with the regulations under the FCRA and FDCPA.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am submitting this formal complaint regarding the unlawful and improper practices of XXXX, XXXX, and Experian ( collectively referred to as the "" Credit Reporting Agencies '' or "" CRAs '' ) related to the illegal reporting of my transaction history. Below, I detail the specific issues and violations of federal law : I am formally opting out of any and all authorizations I may have givenwhether written, verbal, unwritten, or impliedfor the CRAs to share reporting of my transaction history Under 15 U.S.C. 6801, financial institutions and their agents are bound by an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy and confidentiality of consumers ' non-public personal information. Reporting transaction history without explicit consent violates this statute. 

Violation : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX have engaged in the unauthorized reporting of my transaction history, which is illegal without my consent. 

Impact : This unauthorized action directly undermines the Congressional mandate for safeguarding consumer privacy, as outlined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its supporting provisions under the FCRA Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S.C. 6801 Unlawful Reporting of Charged-Off Debt as Income Under federal law, charged-off debts are considered income for tax purposes when reported to the IRS via a 1099-C form. However, income is not a permissible category for reporting on consumer credit reports under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The FCRA and related case law establish that consumer credit reports must only contain accurate and permissible information directly related to creditworthiness, not income classifications. 

Violation : XXXX, XXXX, and Experian are unlawfully reporting charged-off debts as derogatory trade lines on my credit report despite their reclassification as "" income '' under IRS regulations XXXX This constitutes a clear violation of the FCRA because income, especially income derived from forgiven debt, is not authorized for inclusion in consumer credit reporting. 

Supporting Legal Precedents : XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( a ) : Restricts the type of information that can appear on a consumer report. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  : Emphasized that misleading information on credit reports can violate the FCRA. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  : Highlighted the importance of accurate classification of debt in credit reporting. 
Impact : The misreporting of charged-off debt as a derogatory item when it should be classified as income causes severe harm to my credit profile and undermines my creditworthiness. Additionally, it subjects me to undue financial and reputational harm by inaccurately portraying my financial behavior.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,32835,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10988142

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Name : XXXX XXXX Email : XXXX Phone : XXXX Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date of Charge-Off : XX/XX/2023 Original Balance : {$7200.00} Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX XXXX : Request for 1099-C Form for Charged-Off Debt Dear, CFPB This letter serves as my **fifth request** for the deletion and removal of a charged-off account with Excite Alliance. Despite four prior attempts to obtain a **1099-C form** related to the cancellation of the debt associated with this account, I have yet to receive any response or acknowledgment from your office. This lack of action is a direct violation of both my rights under federal tax law and consumer protection laws related to credit reporting. As stipulated by Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) 6050P, XXXX XXXX is legally required to issue a 1099-C form when a debt of {$600.00} or more is canceled. The failure to issue this form constitutes a violation of federal law, as you are obligated to report cancelled debts to both the IRS and the consumer. This issue has gone unresolved for far too long. To also add, this account has multiple inaccuracies thats reporting false information across all 3 bureaus. Furthermore, under the **Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 1681**, all information reported to credit bureaus must be accurate and complete. The ongoing reporting of this charged-off account is not only incorrect but also misleading. As per the FCRA, if an account is charged off or forgiven, and if the debt is cancelled, the report must reflect this cancellation, and the account should be removed from my credit report or marked as paid or settled with a zero balance. The continued reporting of this account as an open, charged-off balance, without issuing the required 1099-C, is an inaccurate representation of my financial obligations and violates my rights under the FCRA. As a consumer, I am entitled to accurate reporting and full transparency regarding any debt that has been forgiven or settled. By failing to issue a **1099-C form** and continuing to report a charged-off account, Excite Alliance is infringing upon my rights under the **Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) **, which protects consumers from misleading and unfair practices by debt collectors and creditors. I request the immediate removal of this charged-off account from my credit report and the deletion of all associated negative entries that do not reflect the true status of the debt. This includes removing any record of the account that reflects it as charged off or in default if the debt has been forgiven or settled. Please delete and remove all this account. 

Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date of Charge-Off : XX/XX/2023 Original Balance : {$7200.00} If this matter is not resolved within 15 days, I will be forced to pursue further action, which may include : 1. Filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) for failure to comply with **credit reporting laws 2. Reporting this noncompliance to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) for failure to issue the required **1099-C form.

3. Seeking legal recourse for any violations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other applicable laws. 

Attached will also be the previous letters send out to this creditor. I expect written confirmation of these actions within 15 days from the date of this letter.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by Experian and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ). My repeated disputes about the accuracy and verifiability of a charge-off account reported on my Experian credit report have not been resolved, and neither party has provided sufficient evidence or documentation to validate the information. 

Details of the Disputed Account Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Reported Status : Charge-Off Open Date : XX/XX/year> Current Status : {$0.00} Balance Summary of the Issue Failure to Provide Verification I first disputed this account with Experian and Upstart because the reported information is inaccurate and unverifiable. 

Despite my repeated written requests, XXXX has failed to provide any substantial proof or documentation to verify the account 's accuracy. 
Violation of the FCRA Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) are required to investigate disputes within 30 days. The information must be deleted from the consumers credit report if it can not be verified.

As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information that can not be verified must be promptly deleted. XXXX has not provided verifiable proof of this account, rendering it unverifiable and requiring its removal. 

Experian has failed to fulfill its obligation to delete the inaccurate information, and XXXX has failed to provide the necessary documentation to validate the account. 

I have attached the following documents to support my complaint : Copies of my dispute letters to Experian and XXXX. 

Notes from my correspondence regarding the lack of response and verifiability. 
A copy of my credit report showing the inaccurate charge-off for account XXXX. 

I believe my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, have been violated. Experian has failed to fulfill its legal obligations to : Investigate my dispute within the required 30-day period. 

Obtain verification of the disputed charge-off account from the data furnisher ( XXXX ). 
Delete the charge-off account from my credit report when it was determined that the data furnisher could not verify the accuracy of the account. 

As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information that can not be verified must be promptly deleted from my credit report. XXXX has not provided verifiable proof of this account, demonstrating that it is unverifiable and must be removed from my credit report immediately. 

In light of the failure of both Experian and XXXX to provide verifiable proof of the disputed account, I respectfully request that the CFPB : Investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure compliance with federal laws governing credit reporting and debt validation. 

Direct Experian to immediately delete the disputed charge-off account ( XXXX ) from my credit report due to its inaccurate and unverifiable nature. 

Enforce any applicable penalties against XXXX and/or Experian for their failure to comply with the FCRA. 

This situation has caused undue stress and damaged my credit score and financial well-being. I trust the CFPB will take appropriate action to resolve this matter. Should you require any further information or documentation, I am happy to provide it. Don't hesitate to get in touch with me at XXXX or XXXX.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by Experian and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ). My repeated disputes about the accuracy and verifiability of a charge-off account reported on my Experian credit report have not been resolved, and neither party has provided sufficient evidence or documentation to validate the information. 

Details of the Disputed Account Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Account Number : XXXX Reported Status : Charge-Off Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX Current Status : {$0.00} Balance ( Transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX ) Summary of the Issue Failure to Provide Verification I first disputed this account with Experian and XXXX because the reported information is inaccurate and unverifiable. 

Despite my repeated written requests, XXXX has failed to provide any substantial proof or documentation to verify the accuracy of the account. Instead, I received an email response on XX/XX/XXXX, stating that no investigation was necessary because XXXX was no longer servicing the loan at the time of the dispute. 
Account Transferred to XXXX XXXX, XXXX In XXXX response, they claimed the account had been transferred to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, as of XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, when I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, they informed me that they have no record of the account and are not authorized to collect in Virginia, where I reside. 

Violation of the FCRA Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) are required to investigate disputes within 30 days. If the information can not be verified, it must be deleted from the consumers credit report.

As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information that can not be verified must be promptly deleted. XXXX has confirmed it no longer services this loan, and XXXX XXXX, XXXX has stated they have no record. Thus, the charge-off is unverifiable and must be removed. 

Experian has failed to fulfill its obligation to delete the inaccurate information, and both XXXX and XXXX XXXX have failed to provide the necessary documentation to validate the account. 

I have attached the following documents to support my complaint : Copies of my dispute letters to Experian and XXXX. 
The email response from XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
Notes from my conversation with XXXX XXXX, XXXX, confirm they have no record of the account and are not allowed to collect in Virginia. 
A copy of my credit report showing the inaccurate charge-off. 

I believe my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, have been violated. Experian has failed to fulfill its legal obligations to : Investigate my dispute within the required 30-day period. 

Obtain verification of the disputed charge-off account from the data furnisher ( XXXX ). 
Delete the charge-off account from my credit report when it was determined that the data furnisher could not verify the accuracy of the account. 

As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), any information that can not be verified must be promptly deleted from my credit report. XXXX has confirmed that it was no longer servicing the loan at the time of my dispute, and XXXX XXXX, XXXX has stated they have no record of the account. This demonstrates the account is unverifiable and must be removed from my credit report immediately. 

In light of the failure of both Experian and XXXX to provide verifiable proof of the disputed account, and given XXXX XXXX  confirmation that they have no record of the account, I respectfully request that the CFPB : Investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure compliance with federal laws governing credit reporting and debt validation. 

Direct Experian to immediately delete the disputed charge-off account from my credit report due to its inaccurate and unverifiable nature. 

Enforce any applicable penalties against XXXX, Experian, and/or XXXX XXXX for failing to comply with the FCRA. 

This situation has caused undue stress and damaged my credit score and financial well-being. I trust the CFPB will take appropriate action to resolve this matter. Should you require any further information or documentation, I am happy to provide it. Don't hesitate to get in touch with me at XXXX or XXXX.

2. Disputed Account Status : XXXX : Account information disputed by consumer, meets FCRA requirements. 
Experian : Customer disputed account - reported by subscriber. 
These comments are inconsistent and may mislead creditors about the resolution status of the dispute.

3. Outdated or Improper Reporting : The Date Last Active for Experian is listed as XX/XX/XXXX, but the Last Reported date is XX/XX/XXXX. If no activity occurred since XXXX, the account may no longer be eligible for reporting under FCRA guidelines, as negative information ( e.g., collections ) must be removed after seven years from the date of first delinquency.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am filing this complaint against the Credit Reporting Agencies ( CRAs ) for the following violations : Fraudulent Reporting of Charged-Off Accounts Failure to Honor Opt-Out Rights Under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802 ) CRAs are illegally reporting charged-off accounts on my credit report. A charged-off account is classified as income when reported to the IRS on a 1099-C form. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), income can not legally be reported as a debt on a credit report.

Violation : Reporting these charged-off accounts as debts is misleading, inaccurate, and against federal law under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), which prohibits the reporting of false information on a credit report.

Under 15 U.S.C. 6802, I have the legal right to opt out of the sharing of my non-public personal information ( NPI ) at any time. Despite this, the CRAs have failed to honor my opt-out request and continue to use and share my data without my permission.

Lawful Right to Opt-Out : According to 12 C.F.R. 1016.10, consumers can opt out of the sharing of their information with third parties at any time, regardless of any prior authorizationswritten, verbal, implied, or otherwise.

Under 15 U.S.C. 6801, it is unlawful for any financial institution or Credit Reporting Agency ( CRA ) to report transaction history without my explicit consent. Congress has made it clear that financial institutions have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of their customers and to safeguard the security and confidentiality of their non-public personal information ( NPI ).

Violation : the CRAs have illegally reported my transaction history without my knowledge or consent. This is a clear breach of their statutory obligations under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) and related provisions of the FCRA.

Privacy Obligation : Under 15 U.S.C. 6801 ( b ), financial institutions are required to implement safeguards to ensure the privacy of their customers ' information.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. 6801, further protects my personal information, mandating that financial institutions and those who furnish information to credit reporting agencies must respect my privacy and the confidentiality of my nonpublic personal information. I have not provided consent to either XXXX or Experian to share my personal data or information related to any accounts opened in my name, including the disputed XXXX account. 

Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 1681b and 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) prohibit the reporting of certain adverse information beyond a specified period, and require consumer consent to furnish data to credit agencies. Since I did not authorize the creation of the XXXX account in question, the account is an unlawful and unauthorized entry on my credit report. 

Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681s2 ( a ) ( 1 ) clearly states that no person may report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency if they know, or have reasonable cause to believe, that the information is incorrect. Since I did not authorize the account and it appears to be fraudulent, the furnisher of information has violated this requirement.

As a consumer, I am also exercising my right to opt out of your reporting services. Under 12 C.F.R. 1016.7, I have the right to opt out of having my information shared with third parties, and I am exercising that right immediately. 

I request that the fraudulent account associated with XXXX XXXX be removed from my credit report, as it was opened without my knowledge or consent. I further request that you confirm in writing that the necessary corrections have been made. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please provide written confirmation that this account has been removed and that my privacy rights have been upheld in accordance with federal law.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30034,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10987119

I have taken immediate action by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and I have enclosed my Identity Theft Report as evidence of this crime. Additionally, I have contacted the credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) to request validation of the debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). However, the information I requested has not been provided, which further confirms the lack of legitimacy surrounding this account. 

The fraudulent activity violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which ensures the accuracy of information reported to consumer reporting agencies, and the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which makes the unauthorized use of my personal information a federal crime.

XXXX XXXX XXXX needs prior consent from either the court or the consumer before communication with the collection of any debt to a credit reporting agency. 
Notice, it is a fact, I the consumer did not give prior consent to communication to the debt collector, { XXXX XXXX XXXX } and the consumer alleges there was no prior consent from a court giving permission to contact I, the consumer in collection of any debts owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX and thus this communication by XXXX XXXX XXXX is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692c ( a ) without a court order brought forth. I did not consent to XXXX XXXX XXXX communicating with me any obligations to pay a debt through any mediums which includes communication with the credit reporting agencies to report the alleged debt. Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692a ( 6 ) 1692a ( 6 ) - a debt collector is defined as anyone in the business of collecting a debt. Therefore by definition XXXX XXXX XXXX is debt collector. 

Notice, it is a fact, that, I, agent for principal ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) am aware that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a debt collector by the legal definition. Pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692 ( a ) ( 6 ), a debt collector is any person who uses instrumentality of interstate commerce, such as the mails, in any business which the principal purpose is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another Furthermore this law U.S.Code 1692d states A Debt collector may not engage in any conduct ( no restriction ) which will harass, oppress or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt. Oppressing a right would be conduct not allowed from 1692d. Credit is the right granted and protected by federal law. If any debt collection caused a denial of credit this allows for damages. I have been denied credit on multiple occasions and denied housing because of this negative account on XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. This is an actual damage as this tremendously harmed my ability to operate in commerce and purchase household goods and shelter for I the consumer and my family. 

Notice, it is a fact, I the affiant is aware, credit is a right granted to me as a creditor under the Truth in Lending Act and { XXXX XXXX XXXX } does not have the right to oppress or abuse any part of my character which would restrict or prohibit my right to extend credit. XXXX XXXX XXXX has oppressed my right to extend credit which is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692d.

Furthermore this law 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ) states the actions performed by XXXX XXXX XXXX was illegal- Communicating with any person false credit information including failure to communicate the debt is being disputed has not been verified. As well as there being no contract that exists bewteen the I the consumer and XXXX XXXX XXXX thats says I the consumer would pay XXXX XXXX XXXX the alleged debt this was false and misleading reporting. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware and has proof in this complaint of false and inaccurate credit information reported and it is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ). XXXX XXXX XXXX reported a debt collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. I the affiant have disputed this debt this information can not keep reporting while the dispute is still not resolved as well as failing to communicate with the credit reporting agencies that the debt is being disputed and has not been verified by I, the consumer. This was very misleading and XXXX XXXX XXXX used this as a tactic to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting a fake debt while at the same time attempting to force me to pay the alleged debt under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting the negative collections account to my consumer report in doing so severely damaging my credit worthiness and my ability to operate in commerce and obtain household goods and shelter. I have been denied housing on multiple occasions leading to me being in a homeless shelter this is an actual damage to I, the consumer. I demand once again that XXXX XXXX XXXX fix this issue by deleting the account. XXXX XXXX XXXX is also in violation of 15 U.S. code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( I ) 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) - Reported information can not be only transactions and experiences between the consumer and a company. 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ) - The consumer must be given a chance to direct the information whether they want the information about a transaction they had to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, a consumer must be given a chance to direct whether they want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX in doing so is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and this information must be removed. 

I the consumer also know that it is a fact that XXXX XXXX the original creditor assigned the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The two debt collectors that reported the alleged debt and are attempting collect are XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Both debt collectors are attempting to force the consumer to pay under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting a collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. In doing so both companies have severely damaged my ability to operate in commerce and use my right to credit. I the consumer have a right to credit and have had that right taken from me due to the improper use of my consumer report from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ) 1692e ( 12 ) - the assignee clause which makes the 3rd party debt collector and the one who assigns the debt liable. 
XXXX XXXX assigned the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX This means they are both liable for the alleged debt not I the consumer Notice, it is a fact, consumer has reason to be believe and do so believes, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are in violation in accordance to Article XXXX, the assignment of a defaulted note is illegal. Both the assignee and the assigned are both liable for violations under 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ). So I am actually not liable for this debt according to what the law says about the matter. 

The debt was assigned to XXXX XXXX XXXX they are attempting to collect a debt that they were assigned. XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX do not have any contract which contains my signature nor does a contract exists that states XXXX XXXX XXXX would pay XXXX XXXX XXXX any payment for a debt. 

There is no contract between the consumer and the debt collectors. This violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) which prohibits abusive, unfair, or deceptive debt collection practices ; if you are contacted by multiple XXXX for the same debt. Both XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have both contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX in an attempt to collect a debt. 
XXXX XXXX had no right to sell the account without notice to i the consumer before doing so. XXXX XXXX also had no right to sell the debt because XXXX XXXX already received income from I the consumer. XXXX XXXX already received full payment of the debt. XXXX XXXX withdrew funds from my Social Security trust account. XXXX Treasury XXXX XXXX XXXX Account - [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBER XXXX XXXXXXXX, with IRS Form 1099-A. The IRS XXXX department can properly account for the transfer of these funds from this account to all debt accounts that I am said to owe or be in default. Due to this fact I, the consumer have no further obligations to XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX also violated 15 U.S.Code 1692j 15 USC 1692 ; 1692 - False and deceptive forms. A form which is made to believe the debt has something to do with you or you are obligated and you are not, is false and deceptive.

Fraud found in a form is a false and deceptive form and a violation of this act. For example if you go and get into an agreement as a consumer credit transaction, you went for something and gave credit. Companies are known to make what's called asset accounts. I never went to have an account made, this is a false and deceptive form because they never disclose this account being made. This includes statements which falsely accuses me of owing a debt. The delivery of these forms via mail constitutes mail fraud. I also never created an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX if I the consumer did not open the account then it is fraud. 

Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, there has been fraud found in this form shown in EXHIBIT ( - ). This form is therefore false and deceptive, void and a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692j I do not have a contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) 15 USC 16324010 ) 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) - Allows for any action of damage.

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a
) ( 1 ) allows civil liability rewards for any damages, which may include stress, harassment, anxiety, mental anguish, and other damages all caused by violations of FDCPA due to XXXX XXXX XXXX abusive and deceptive business practices. Which caused I the consumer to be denied for housing and certain lines of credit. Which caused I the consumer to be in a homeless shelter and and unable to operate in commerce this is very un equitable. 

Furthermore I am owed monetary value in the amount of XXXX $ for every single violation of the UNITED STATES CODES. 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - XXXX dollars for each proceeding. 
Notice, it is a fact, 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) states an individual action is a violation worth 1000 dollars for proceeding, however understand 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) these violations has caused actual damage By XXXX XXXX XXXX violating 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and not giving me a chance to direct whether I want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX in doing so XXXX XXXX XXXX is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) I was damaged by this violation of the law XXXX XXXX XXXX took it upon themselves to infringe on my right to direct the information I want reported regarding the transaction. Then hindering my ability to credit by reporting without my directions a collections account that negatively impacted my consumer report. 
Every violation of the law by XXXX XXXX XXXX caused a damage to I, the consumer. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX also committed identity theft. They obtained my identifying information such as my social security number to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting the fraudulent account. This use of my social security number was not authorized by I the consumer. 15 U.S.Code 1644 ( a ) 15 USC 1644 ( a ) 1644 ( a ) - Fraudulent authorized use of a credit card such as a license plate, social security card, XXXX card etc, can result up to a XXXX fine. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, the fraudulent use of a credit card, by XXXX XXXX XXXX is defined as whoever uses, attempts or conspires to use a card to obtain money, goods or services shall be fined for {$10000.00} or imprisoned for 10 years or both. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX used my social security account number the exact number on social security card to report information to my consumer report and to collect on a debt.

This is a direct violation of 1644 ( a ) Also note that this matter could become even more serious if this issues isnt resolved because according to 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) -If i win a civil suit and file a class action, i can obtain up to XXXX XXXX or 1 % of the company. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, If judgement is made against { XXXX XXXX XXXX } I, the affiant, can and will pursue class action for the amount of XXXXXXXX XXXX to 1 % of your company in accordance with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( a ) ( XXXX ) ( B ) meaning I could own a percentage of XXXX XXXX XXXX or receive XXXXXXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX inconveniences to I the consumer.

It has come to my attention that certain information reported on my credit file may be inaccurate, inconsistent, or unverifiable. Under the FCRA and Metro 2 standards, creditors are obligated to provide accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) in a timely manner. 
I want to emphasize the importance of adhering to the prescribed reporting requisites and standards. Even if the information reported is factually correct, it must be reported precisely according to the mandated format, such as Metro 2 data field formatting. Any deviations from these standards may render the reported information deficient and non-compliant. 
Therefore, I am exercising my rights as a consumer to demand the removal of any inaccuracies and deficiencies from my credit report. I request a thorough investigation into the sources of these accounts to ensure that creditors have fully complied with industry reporting standards, including Metro 2 requirements. 
It is crucial to ascertain that all alleged reporting data furnishers can accurately provide my complete file information to all major credit reporting agencies, including XXXX, Experian, and XXXX. 
Furthermore, I want to highlight the significance of the FCRA 's provision regarding the accuracy of consumer reports ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Consumer reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information contained in consumer reports.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To : Credit Reporting Agency Subject : Request for Removal of Unverifiable Account Dear Credit Reporting Department, I am writing to formally request the removal of an account from my credit report as reported by [ XXXX, Experian, or XXXX ]. This request is based on the recent deletion of an account by XXXX, one of the four major credit reporting agencies. I recently disputed a charge-off for {$25000.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX listed on my XXXX report, and following a thorough investigation, XXXX has completely deleted this unverifiable debt from my report as of XX/XX/. 
According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), all consumer reporting agencies must ensure that information in consumer reports is accurate, fair, and verifiable. Since XXXX has removed this account after its verification process, I request that you do the same and remove this unverifiable account from my credit report. 
Supporting Consumer Laws : FCRA Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires that inaccurate or unverifiable information must be deleted from a consumer 's credit file. I am exercising my right to ensure that my credit report remains fair, accurate, and free of unverifiable information. Since XXXX has deemed this account unverifiable and removed it, you must take similar action. 
Additionally, under FCRA Section 623 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), information suppliers must report only complete and accurate information. With XXXX having deemed this information unverifiable, I urge you to align its records accordingly. 
Please provide confirmation of this removal within 30 days of receipt of this request. If the account is not removed, I am prepared to pursue further actions, including filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seeking legal action under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), including Section 616 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n ), which allows consumers to seek legal recourse for willful noncompliance, and Section 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681o ) for negligent non-compliance. 
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter, as it directly impacts my credit reports integrity. Please notify me in writing once this deletion has been processed. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this request.

XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX : The report states, Account information disputed by consumer, meets FCRA requirements. If you did not agree to this dispute resolution or if the dispute was not properly investigated, this statement might be misleading. 
XXXX. Unauthorized Transfer or Assignment of Debt : If you did not agree to any payments or the transfer of this account to a third party ( XXXX Funding ), it could be a violation of consumer protection laws, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 
XXXX. Potential Obsolete Information : The accounts Date Opened is listed as XX/XX/XXXX, with the Last Reported date as XX/XX/XXXX. If the original delinquency occurred in XXXX, this account XXXX soon exceed the seven-year reporting limit for negative items under the FCRA. 
XXXX. Lack of Supporting Payment History : The report does not provide a detailed payment history or verification of how the debt reached Collection/Chargeoff status. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the accuracy and verifiability of the report. 
XXXX. Incorrect Reporting of Collection Activity : If XXXX Funding is reporting this account as Collection/Chargeoff without proper documentation or consent, this could constitute a violation of the FCRA and FDCPA. 

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and FDCPA : XXXX. 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Failure to Ensure Maximum Possible Accuracy : Credit reporting agencies must ensure the information they report is accurate and verifiable. Inconsistent and unclear reporting violates this standard.

Upon reviewing my credit report, I noticed a charged-off account listed under [ XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ] with the account number [ XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ].

I kindly request that you conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and update my credit report to accurately reflect the status of this account. Please confirm the resolution of this dispute in writing to my address above, and ensure that any necessary corrections are made to my credit report.

2024-12-01,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I recently had a frustrating experience with a furniture delivery that I'd like to share. The delivery team arrived but quickly assessed that the box wouldnt fit through my doorway, even though another company had successfully delivered furniture to my apartment before. The driver didn't measure anything ; he just assumed it wouldn't fit. I suggested they take the furniture out of the box, as I had paid for delivery to the room of my choice and wasn't concerned about how they managed it. 

While I was on the phone with the furniture company discussing the situation, the driver drove off with my furniture. Several days passed without any updates, and when I finally heard back, they wanted to know if I wanted redelivery. I had taken a day off work for this delivery, and I have a witness who saw everything unfold. 

To make matters worse, my credit card company, Chase, claimed that I had canceled the order and imposed a cancellation fee. Yet, my credit card has been charge the full amount. This didnt make sense to me since the delivery team left with my furniture without even taking it off the truck. The driver had mentioned that the furniture would get dirty if he delivered it, but I was okay with that as I had also purchased a warranty for it. However, I was charged an extra {$100.00} for this warranty, which I found questionable since it wasn't clear on their website. Along with another XXXX dollars for brackets to hold the couch together. I had to change the order and called in and they up charged me XXXX dollars. 

It feels like a scam, as by Illinois law, the company should honor the contract by delivering on the agreed date. Instead, they're claiming I canceled. I attempted to arrange redelivery, but they now want to charge me {$300.00}, which is ridiculous. When I inquired about cancellation fees due to their shadiness, they informed me they had already disposed of the furniture and Id have to reorder it. 

Chase also refused to refund me, insisting I canceled. I only refused to take the furniture after they drove off with it. Even now, in trying to resolve the issue, they are still trying to charge me that additional fee. It's incredibly frustrating, especially since they no longer have the furniture, and I believe a refund is due.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,IL,622XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10987450

I RECEIVED EMAIL THAT MY MOBEY HAD BEEN REFUNDED. I checked my Inbox dollars account and {$30.00} had been placed in it. I then attempted to order a {$30.00} XXXX card and my money was taken out by BLACKHAWK NETWORK requesting again the same Information that I already sent. Now at this point my money is being held hostage with a ransome of sending the card email link I was sent at first. I now want my money placed back into my account as I no longer want to any sort of business with this company. I requested that I be made whole ( {$30.00} ) be returned as they had no permission to take it out that XXXX time. 
I spoke with them in particular an agent named XXXX that flatly refused to return my hijacked funds. 
A contact number for them XXXX. 
I received another message today XX/XX/XXXX from this company to reply with the information. 
Even if they asked me to just type the letter A and send it to them I do not want a card from them just my money be out back into my account.

Upon reviewing my credit file, I identified significant inaccuracies in the reporting of this account. I believe the company has violated consumer protection laws under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), specifically regarding the handling and reporting of charge-offs. 

Key Concerns : 1. Incomplete and Inaccurate Reporting : The reported charge-off contains errors that suggest it is not in compliance with FCRA Section 623, which mandates data furnishers to report accurate and complete information.

2. Discrepancies in Key Dates : The Date of Last Reporting ( DLR ) and Date of Last Activity ( DLA ) listed for this account are inconsistent and do not accurately reflect the true history of this account. These inaccuracies violate FCRA provisions requiring precise and truthful reporting of account details.

3. Debt Validation Request Ignored : Under FDCPA Section 809 ( b ), I have the right to request validation of the alleged debt. Credit Collection Service failed to provide sufficient validation despite my written request.

4. Improper Collection Practices : I suspect the charge-off was improperly calculated and misreported to credit bureaus, potentially violating FDCPA and FCRA standards for fair and accurate reporting.

Given these violations and the inaccurate reporting of the DLR and DLA, I respectfully request that this account be permanently removed from my consumer report as it fails to meet the requirements set forth by federal law.

To assist in your investigation, I have attached copies of my credit report, prior correspondence with Credit Collection Service, and relevant documents for your review.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to a prompt resolution to this matter. Please feel free to contact me at XXXX or XXXX for further details.

After I agreed for them to do a hard pull on my credit to check if I qualify I got news I didn't qualify, it ended up being a bait and switch...

I have received countless calls and XXXX from them literally it started at XXXX per day to now 3 to 6 a day, they eventually sold my PII to XXXX XXXX without my consent or knowledge. 


My PII was then compromised in a cyber security incident... 

I reached out to XXXX telling them they had either obtained my PII illegally or have illegally been provided my information as I never did business with them.nor did I ever sign up for any debt consolidation service. 


I'm still getting calls from Lendvia despite asking them to put me on the do not call list and despite signing up for the FCC no call list multiple times... 

I want Lendvia fined to oblivion for the harassing phone calls, selling my info, and damages suffered as a result... 

I half to keep my phone on silence unknown callers to block the spam calls while I work... This prevents me from receiving call backs from emergency services, management at work, it blocks family emergency calls from school and my families places 's of buinsess, and blocks me from receiving emergency calls from my kid when calling from other lines..

This was clearly a billing error made my the company and is not a reflection of my payment experience which violates USC Code 1681eb. This error has caused severe hard to my reputation, my character, my mode of living and to my family!

I demand the late payment reported in 60 - 90 DAYS to be removed. 


They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 


NAVY FEDERAL CR UNION Never Sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

2024-12-01,Debt collection,Telecommunications debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"To Whom It XXXX Concern, I am filing this formal complaint regarding Credence Resource Management, that has violated my rights under federal law. The agency has placed a collection account on my consumer report without providing the legally required validation information as outlined in 12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ). Furthermore, I have not been given a reasonable opportunity to dispute the account, which violates 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ).

The actions of Credence Resource Management are in direct violation of my consumer rights. Specifically, they have engaged in false, misleading, and deceptive practices by : 1. Failing to provide the required validation information before furnishing the account to consumer reporting agencies.

2. Furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies without first complying with the disclosure requirements under 12 CFR 1006.34 ( d ).

3. Violating 15 USC 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 7 ), which governs the responsibilities of furnishers to provide accurate information.

It is both unfair and unlawful for this agency to report this collection account without complying with these regulatory requirements. Their actions undermine my ability to exercise my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate this matter promptly. I seek immediate resolution, removal of the inaccurate collection account from my consumer report, and enforcement of compliance with all applicable laws. 

During a recent interaction with a representative, I was informed that this agency was XXXX at first. However, I have since confirmed that they are, in fact, a collection agency, not XXXX  after a phone conversation. This deliberate misrepresentation is both deceptive and unethical.

Subsequently, I raised the matter with my credit card company, which opened a dispute. However, XXXX XXXX rebutted the claim, stating that their terms and conditions prohibited flight changes. I later discovered that XXXX XXXX had updated their terms and conditions after my booking, likely in response to complaints such as mine. This retroactive change to policies is dishonest and misleading.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am filing this formal complaint against XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Capital One for the following violations : Fraudulent Reporting of Charge-Offs as Debt ( IRS Classification of Income ). 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Ignoring My Letters and Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ). 
Failure to Disclose Securitization of Promissory Notes. 
Non-Compliance with Audit Reporting and GAAP Standards.

Fraudulent Reporting of Charge-Offs as Debt The reporting of charge-offs on my credit report is fraudulent and misleading. According to IRS regulations, charge-offs are classified as income on a 1099-C form when reported to the IRS. Per federal law, income can not be reported as debt on a consumer credit report.

Violation : Reporting charge-offs as debt breaches the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, which prohibits the reporting of inaccurate information. 

Demand : XXXXXXXX XXXX and Capital One must immediately remove all charge-offs from my credit report as these entries are misleading and harmful to my financial reputation. 
2. Breach of Fiduciary Duty : Ignoring My Letters and Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ) I have sent multiple letters asserting my rights, including a Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ), which has been ignored by both XXXXXXXX XXXX and Capital One. By failing to respond, these entities have violated their fiduciary obligations and undermined my rights to assert my interest in the credit. 

Legal Precedent : XXXX XXXX XXXX establishes that promissory notes fully fund credit, rendering the consumer the true creditor. As the creditor, I retain rights and interests in the credit and demand acknowledgment of the same. 
Demand : XXXXXXXX XXXX and Capital One must immediately recognize my rights as the creditor and provide a detailed response to all letters and DPOA documents sent. 

XXXX. Failure to Disclose Securitization of Promissory Notes It has come to my attention that the promissory notes I provided to XXXXXXXX XXXX and Capital One were securitized and sold without my knowledge or consent. This failure to disclose constitutes fraud and unjust enrichment. 

Violation : Under 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( Truth in Lending Act - TILA ), lenders are required to disclose the sale, assignment, or transfer of debt instruments to third parties. 

Fraudulent Omission : By securitizing my promissory notes and profiting from the proceeds, without compensating me as the original creditor, XXXXXXXX XXXX and Capital One have committed fraud. 
Demand : Provide full disclosure of the securitization of my promissory notes, including an accounting of proceeds and confirmation that these proceeds have been applied to offset any alleged debt. 

4. Non-Compliance with Audit Reporting and GAAP Standards Under federal law and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), financial institutions are required to provide accurate audit reports and account reconciliations.

Legal Obligation : 12 U.S.C. 1831n ( a ) mandates compliance with GAAP standards for all financial institutions.

15 U.S.C. 1637 ( TILA ) requires creditors to provide clear and accurate account information. 
Violation : XXXXXXXX XXXX and Capital One have failed to provide audit reports and reconcile accounts as requested. Their lack of transparency further suggests that the reporting of charge-offs is fraudulent and unsupported by proper accounting practices. 


Formal Opt-Out of Authorization and Illegality of Reporting Transaction History Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am formally opting out of any and all authorizations I may have givenwhether written, unwritten, verbal, or non-verbalunder 15 U.S.C. 6802. As a consumer, I have the unequivocal right to opt out of the sharing and use of my non-public personal information ( NPI ) at any time.

By exercising this opt-out right : Unauthorized Reporting is Illegal : Under 15 U.S.C. 6801, it is illegal for financial institutions to report or share my transaction history without my explicit consent. 

The policy of Congress explicitly mandates that every financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to protect the security, confidentiality, and privacy of its customers ' NPI.

2024-12-01,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"Back in XXXX I contacted the Department of Finance for NYS attempting to file a claim. I was redirected here, but my letter was sent to Chase ' executive team. I gave them the opportunity to thoroughly address my issue and still there was not a reasonable resolve.

This was the official complaint : I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the consistent overdraft fees that have been assessed to my Chase Performance Business Checking account, despite my adherence to the terms of Chases Overdraft Assist program. 

When I opened this account, I was bringing in $ XXXX to $ XXXX per month through XXXX. The banker who set up my account opened a Chase Performance Business Checking account that required maintaining a daily $ XXXX balance, something I was unaware of at the time. Over the following months, I noticed high charges for service fees, but neither I nor the tellers at my local branch could determine why. Eventually, a telephone banker informed me of the account requirements and explained that I had Overdraft Assist due to the nature of my account, which required me to transfer funds into my account before XXXX XXXX  the next business day to avoid fees. 

Since then, I have been diligently transferring funds before the XXXX XXXX  XXXX  cut-off via instant ACH transfers from XXXX, but I continue to be charged overdraft fees. These transfers reduce my balance to under {$50.00}, which should, according to Chases published terms, exempt me from these fees. 

Here are the specific issues : I have had to call customer service repeatedly over the past few months to request fee reviews. Each time, a supervisor would confirm that I made the transfers on time, and the fees would be reversed, though I was told this was done as a courtesy rather than a correction of a technical issue. 
Recently, I was informed that further fees could not be reversed, and a case was opened. However, I was given no valid explanation for why the fees continue to be applied, despite my compliance with the Overdraft Assist terms.

I have not seen any indication that instant ACH transfers from external sources like XXXX  are exempt from Overdraft Assist, yet I am still incurring fees. This is contradictory to Chases own terms, which state : Chases Published Terms on Overdraft Fees : No Overdraft Fees should be charged if my account is overdrawn by {$50.00} or less at the end of the next business day, or if I transfer funds to bring the balance to {$50.00} or less by XXXX XXXX XXXX 
No Overdraft Fees should apply to transactions under {$5.00} or debit card transactions authorized when sufficient funds were available. 
I have also reviewed the agreement and found nothing excluding instant transfers from external sources. 
This situation has placed an undue financial burden on my business, as I have complied with all terms and have consistently made transfers before the XXXX XXXX  cut-off. Yet, the fees persist, and I am continually told they can not be reversed beyond what has been labeled as courtesy adjustments. 

Given the above, I am respectfully requesting : A full audit of the overdraft fees assessed on my account over the past few months. 
Reimbursement for any fees that were wrongfully applied, despite my adherence to the Overdraft Assist terms.

Clarification on why these fees continue to be assessed despite my timely transfers, as I see no language indicating that external instant transfers are not covered.

This ongoing issue has caused significant financial strain on my business, and I hope for a swift resolution. I trust that Chase will address this matter with the seriousness it deserves. 

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your prompt response and resolution. 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I even took a step further to post it on XXXX in case it was me who was mistaken. 
Full Story : I've been a Chase customer for over 20 years, initially for personal banking and now for business. In XXXX, I opened a business checking account at the regular level. By XXXX, a banker upgraded it to Premier Checking, saying it was best for high transaction volume. The account requires a $ XXXX daily balance to avoid monthly fees, which sometimes is a stretch. 

Since the pandemic, Ive noticed substantial monthly fees ( often $ XXXX {$900.00} ) that Chase labels as "" service charges. '' I use XXXX for payment processing and only transfer funds into this account to cover rent, vendors, and expenses. 

Heres where it gets confusing : Overdraft Assist Issues : Ive always requested overdraft protection be turned off, so I avoid fees if the balance is low. But I started seeing fees that Chase couldnt explain. Eventually, a rep told me my account has "" Overdraft Assist, '' meaning if I transfer funds by XXXX XXXX  the next business day after an overdraft, I should avoid fees. Since then, Ive been meticulous, making transfers well before this cutoff. Still, I see these fees. 

Refunds and Escalations : From XXXX to XXXX, I called Chase each month to review these charges. Theyd usually refund about {$700.00}, as the reps saw Id made my transfers according to policy. In XXXX, the fees hit again, but this time the rep escalated the issue instead of refunding. A Chase executive then called to review the case, but still no resolution. They say Im being charged courtesy fees, but no one can explain why its happening in the first place.

Inconsistent Explanations : Some reps say these fees are due to ACH transfers, others mention high transaction volumes, but nothing in my account terms seems to justify these charges. It doesnt make sense, as my transfers are done before the cutoff, and Im not exceeding any transaction limits. 

Cutoff Confusion : One recent rep claimed theres a XXXX XXXX  cutoff for ACH transfers to avoid fees, but another rep said the cutoff is XXXX XXXX. I make instant transfers from XXXX, which should be nearly immediate, so this shouldnt even apply. 

Ive filed a complaint with the state, and Chases executive team is involved, but they havent given me a clear answer. For now, Im not depositing more money until they reverse the fees and explain why this is happening. 

Question : Am I missing something here, or is this an issue on Chases end? Is anyone else having similar issues with Overdraft Assist or Premier accounts? Im open to any advicethanks in advance for your help! 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Update : After weeks of misinformation, I finally received a vague letter stating the charges were "" service fees ''. There was not a breakdown provided for the service fees broken down as requested. I was also recommended to read my service agreement. I have read my agreement back to front and I can not see anywhere where it explains service charges that amount to what I am receiving. I thoroughly believe that Chase has been charging me for overdraft assist because I am transferring from my XXXX account into my Checking account. Even though my available balance and present balance are always in the positive once transferred since it instant, they have been charging me. 

Coincidently, since filing my complaint, all of a sudden the attached messages have shown up on my other Chase business account which is a basic account. My account in the complaint doesn't have the message that conveniently spells out how Overdraft Assist works. It still states that if transferred from an outside account the it may vary, however, again, my present and available balance shows the positive amount from the instant transfer. I have always been transferring in good faith under their rules. I have since stopped transferring funds into the account until a proper resolution happens My account was at a negative {$1400.00}. Majority from fees. This has put me in such a terrible financial position. First, I use my Chase account to pay all of my vendors including my landlord for my business. With the negative balance despite my timely transfers, I had to set up XXXX XXXX with XXXX to make my payments including rent to avoid losing money that I already don't have. I didn't have an extra {$1400.00} to pay in fees.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,11236,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10988595

Despite submitting all required documentation, including a valid Power of Attorney ( POA ), identification, and Social Security information, XXXX has falsely claimed that my identification documents were insufficient or illegible. This baseless rejection constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and undermines the legal validity of my disputes and rescission of signature. 


-- - Background Information : XXXX. Accounts in Dispute : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : {$12000.00} Opened : XX/XX/year> Past Due Amount : {$350.00} XXXX. Submission of Documentation : In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), I submitted disputes to Transunion XXXX XXXX XXXX, asserting that these accounts are inaccurate because they were rescinded under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). As part of my disputes, I provided the following : A certified mail receipt from Transunion A mailing response from XXXX A notarized Power of Attorney document. 

A copy of my valid government-issued identification. 



XXXX. XXXX 's Response : issued a response stating that my identification documents were insufficient or illegible, despite my compliance with their requirements. This is a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts, designed to avoid their obligation to investigate and correct the disputed information under the FCRA. 


Violations : XXXX. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX TransUnion and XXXX is required to conduct a reasonable investigation when a consumer disputes the accuracy of information. By rejecting my valid documentation, XXXX has failed to meet this obligation. 

Failure to Notify Furnishers : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( XXXX ), XXXX TransUnion and XXXX is required to notify creditors of the dispute. Their baseless rejection of my documentation effectively obstructed this process. 

Failure to Ensure Maximum Possible Accuracy : XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( b ), XXXX XXXX TransUnion must ensure that the information reported is accurate. Reporting rescinded accounts as open is a clear violation of this provision. 



XXXX. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : Non-Compliance with Rescission Provisions : The accounts in question were rescinded in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1635, which nullifies any legal obligations tied to the accounts. XXXX refusal to correct this inaccurate reporting violates my rights under XXXX. 



XXXX. Consumer Protection Violations : Obstruction of Legal Process : By rejecting my Power of Attorney and associated documentation, XXXX has obstructed the legal process, preventing me from exercising my rights to dispute and correct inaccurate information. 

Failure to Recognize Legal Authority of Power of Attorney : The Power of Attorney submitted in support of my disputes is a legal instrument granting authority to act on behalf of the principal. XXXX failure to honor this document violates well-established legal principles. 





-- - Conclusion : XXXX  TransUnion and XXXX actions constitute serious violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Truth in Lending Act, and other federal protections. Their failure to honor valid identification and legal documentation is unacceptable and undermines the integrity of consumer rights.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am filing this formal complaint against American Express and XXXX XXXX  for their egregious violations of federal laws, fraudulent reporting of charged-off accounts, and deceptive practices regarding the handling of my promissory notes. Their actions include, but are not limited to, reporting inaccurate debts, failing to disclose the securitization of my promissory notes, and depriving me of my rightful claims and interests as the creditor. 

XXXX. Fraudulent Reporting of Charged-Off Accounts American Express and XXXX XXXX  have unlawfully reported charged-off accounts to credit reporting agencies. Charged-off accounts, when reported to the IRS via 1099-C forms, are classified as income under federal tax law. However, income is not a permissible category for inclusion on a consumer credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681.

Violation : By continuing to report these accounts as outstanding debt on my credit report, American Express and XXXX XXXX  have breached the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), which prohibits the inclusion of inaccurate and impermissible information. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) : The court emphasized that debts reported inaccurately or without validation are unlawful. 
XXXX v. XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) : Misleading credit reporting violates the FCRA and FDCPA. 
XXXX. Breach of Contract : Securitization and Non-Disclosure Both American Express and XXXX XXXX  engaged in the securitization of my promissory notes without my knowledge or consent. Securitization involves selling or transferring the promissory note as an asset, generating proceeds that are not disclosed or applied to offset the alleged debt. 

Violation : Non-Disclosure : Failing to disclose the sale and securitization of my promissory note constitutes fraud and a breach of their duty of good faith and fair dealing. 
No Consideration : As the issuer of the promissory note, I am the creditor and provided the initial value through my signature and agreement. Because I was not compensated for the securitization, there is no outstanding debt owed. 
Proceeds from Sale : The proceeds from the sale of the promissory note must be applied to extinguish any alleged debt. By withholding these funds, American Express and XXXX XXXX  are unjustly enriching themselves at my expense. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : Establishes that a promissory note fully funds the transaction, making the issuer of the note the creditor. Any subsequent sale or securitization of the note is subject to full disclosure and proper accounting to the original issuer. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : Reiterates that the promissory note is the principal obligation, and its assignment must be fully disclosed. 
XXXX. Fraudulent Concealment of Securitization Proceeds American Express and XXXX XXXX  knowingly concealed the securitization of my promissory notes and the proceeds generated from their sale. This fraudulent concealment violates federal and state laws and nullifies any claim that there is a debt owed. 
Legal Basis : UCC 3-305 : Affirmative defenses include failure of consideration and fraud in the inducement.

Restatement ( Second ) of Contracts, 161 : Non-disclosure of material facts constitutes fraud.

4. Claiming My Rights and Interests as the Creditor As the issuer of the promissory notes, I am the creditor and have rights to the proceeds and interests generated from the securitization. By failing to compensate me for these proceeds or properly account for them, American Express and XXXX XXXX  have violated my rights under contract law and federal statutes. 

XXXX. Failure to Provide Audit Reports and XXXX Documentation American Express and XXXX XXXX  have XXXX failed to comply with their legal obligation to provide an accurate audit report and records in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). These reports are critical to ensuring transparency and validating the legitimacy of any claims regarding an alleged debt. 

Legal Obligations Under Federal Law Requirement for GAAP-Compliant Audit Reports Under 15 U.S.C. 78m ( Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ), financial institutions are required to maintain accurate books and records and provide GAAP-compliant audit reports to substantiate any financial transactions. 
Failure to provide such documentation is a violation of federal law and raises concerns about the legitimacy of the alleged debt and the reporting of such debt.

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Violations 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ( TILA ) : Lenders are required to disclose all terms, conditions, and costs associated with a credit transaction. This includes providing clear and accurate accounting of any amounts owed, offsets applied, and proceeds generated through securitization. 
American Express and XXXX XXXX  have violated TILA by failing to disclose : The securitization of my promissory note. 
The proceeds derived from the sale or transfer of the note.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX dispute This complaint is in regard to the account related to XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being reported to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX needs prior consent from either the court or the consumer before communication with the collection of any debt to a credit reporting agency. 
Notice, it is a fact, I the consumer did not give prior consent to communication to the debt collector, { XXXX XXXX XXXX } and the consumer alleges there was no prior consent from a court giving permission to contact I, the consumer in collection of any debts owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX and thus this communication by XXXX XXXX XXXX is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692c ( a ) without a court order brought forth. I did not consent to XXXX XXXX XXXX communicating with me any obligations to pay a debt through any mediums which includes communication with the credit reporting agencies to report the alleged debt. Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692a ( 6 ) 1692a ( 6 ) - a debt collector is defined as anyone in the business of collecting a debt. Therefore by definition XXXX XXXX XXXX is debt collector. 

Notice, it is a fact, that, I, agent for principal ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) am aware that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a debt collector by the legal definition. Pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692 ( a ) ( 6 ), a debt collector is any person who uses instrumentality of interstate commerce, such as the mails, in any business which the principal purpose is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another Furthermore this law U.S.Code 1692d states A Debt collector may not engage in any conduct ( no restriction ) which will harass, oppress or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt. Oppressing a right would be conduct not allowed from 1692d. Credit is the right granted and protected by federal law. If any debt collection caused a denial of credit this allows for damages. I have been denied credit on multiple occasions and denied housing because of this negative account on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report. This is an actual damage as this tremendously harmed my ability to operate in commerce and purchase household goods and shelter for I the consumer and my family. 

Notice, it is a fact, I the affiant is aware, credit is a right granted to me as a creditor under the Truth in Lending Act and { XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX } does not have the right to oppress or abuse any part of my character which would restrict or prohibit my right to extend credit. XXXX XXXX XXXX has oppressed my right to extend credit which is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692d.

Furthermore this law 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ) states the actions performed by XXXX XXXX XXXX was illegal- Communicating with any person false credit information including failure to communicate the debt is being disputed has not been verified. As well as there being no contract that exists bewteen the I the consumer and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX says I the consumer would pay XXXX XXXX XXXX the alleged debt this was false and misleading reporting. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware and has proof in this complaint of false and inaccurate credit information reported and it is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ). XXXX XXXX XXXX reported a debt collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report. I the affiant have disputed this debt this information can not keep reporting while the dispute is still not resolved as well as failing to communicate with the credit reporting agencies that the debt is being disputed and has not been verified by I, the consumer. This was very misleading and XXXX XXXX XXXX used this as a tactic to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting a fake debt while at the same time attempting to force me to pay the alleged debt under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting the negative collections account to my consumer report in doing so severely damaging my credit worthiness and my ability to operate in commerce and obtain household goods and shelter. I have been denied housing on multiple occasions leading to me being in a homeless shelter this is an actual damage to I, the consumer. I demand once again that XXXX XXXX XXXX fix this issue by deleting the account. XXXX XXXX XXXX is also in violation of 15 U.S. code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( I ) 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) - Reported information can not be only transactions and experiences between the consumer and a company. 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ) - The consumer must be given a chance to direct the information whether they want the information about a transaction they had to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, a consumer must be given a chance to direct whether they want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX so is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and this information must be removed.

I the consumer also know that it is a fact that XXXX XXXXXXXX the original creditor assigned the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The two debt collectors that reported the alleged debt and are attempting collect are XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Both debt XXXX are attempting to force the consumer to pay under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting a collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report. In doing so both companies have severely damaged my ability to operate in commerce and use my right to credit. I the consumer have a right to credit and have had that right taken from me due to the improper use of my consumer report from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ) 1692e ( 12 ) - the assignee clause which makes the 3rd party debt collector and the one who assigns the debt liable. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX assigned the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX This means they are both liable for the alleged debt not I the consumer Notice, it is a fact, consumer has reason to be believe and do so believes, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are in violation in accordance to Article 9, the assignment of a defaulted note is illegal. Both the assignee and the assigned are both liable for violations under 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ). So I am actually not liable for this debt according to what the law says about the matter. 

The debt was assigned to XXXX XXXX XXXX they are attempting to collect a debt that they were assigned. XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX do not have any contract which contains my signature nor does a contract exists that states XXXX XXXX XXXX would pay XXXX XXXX XXXX any payment for a debt. 

There is no contract between the consumer and the debt XXXX. This violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) which prohibits abusive, unfair, or deceptive debt collection practices ; if you are contacted by multiple XXXX for the same debt. Both XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX have both contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX in an attempt to collect a debt. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX had no right to sell the account without notice to i the consumer before doing so.

A form which is made to believe the debt has something to do with you or you are obligated and you are not, is false and deceptive.

Fraud found in a form is a false and deceptive form and a violation of this act. For example if you go and get into an agreement as a consumer credit transaction, you went for something and gave credit. Companies are known to make what's called asset accounts. I never went to have an account made, this is a false and deceptive form because they never disclose this account being made. This includes statements which falsely accuses me of owing a debt. The delivery of these forms via mail constitutes mail fraud. I also never created an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX if I the consumer did not open the account then it is fraud. 

Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, there has been fraud found in this form shown in EXHIBIT ( - ). This form is therefore false and deceptive, void and a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692j I do not have a contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX.

Their actions not only infringe upon my statutory rights but also cause significant harm to my financial well-being and reputation. 


Failure to Honor Opt-Out Rights Under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802 ) Under 15 U.S.C. 6802, consumers have the right to opt out of the sharing of non-public personal information ( NPI ). I am formally opting out of any prior or assumed authorizationswritten, verbal, implied, or otherwisegranted to the CRAs or XXXX And XXXX XXXX to use or share my data. Despite this clear directive, these entities have willfully disregarded my right to privacy by continuing to disseminate my XXXX without consent. 


2. Violations of the Privacy Act of 1974 The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that entities handling personal information must notify individuals of its use and provide them with a meaningful opportunity to restrict or control its dissemination. 

Violation : TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX, along with XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX failed to notify me of how my personal information was being shared with third parties and denied me the ability to opt out of these unauthorized disclosures. 
Impact : This lack of transparency infringes upon my fundamental rights to control the use of my personal data. 


XXXX. Illegal Reporting of Charged-Off Debts as Income ( 15 U.S.C. 6801 ) Charged-off debts reported to the IRS via a 1099-C are reclassified as income under federal tax law. Income, however, is not permissible for inclusion on a consumer credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX, and [ Bank Names ] are knowingly violating federal law by falsely reporting charged-off debts as derogatory items instead of removing them as required. 

Violation : The continued reporting of charged-off debts as derogatory trade lines violates 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), which governs the permissible content of consumer reports. 
Case Law : In XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, the court confirmed that debts reported inaccurately or without proper validation are unlawful under the FCRA. This precedent underscores that creditors and CRAs must remove such items promptly. 
Impact : This misclassification harms my creditworthiness and exposes me to undue financial hardship and damage.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To : Credit Reporting Agency Subject : Request for Removal of Unverifiable Account Dear Credit Reporting Department, I am writing to formally request the removal of an account from my credit report as reported by [ XXXX, XXXX, or TransUnion ]. This request is based on the recent deletion of an account by XXXX, one of the four major credit reporting agencies. I recently disputed a charge-off for {$25000.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , listed on my XXXX report, and following a thorough investigation, XXXX has completely deleted this unverifiable debt from my report as of XX/XX/year>. 
According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), all consumer reporting agencies must ensure that information in consumer reports is accurate, fair, and verifiable. Since XXXX has removed this account after its verification process, I request that you do the same and remove this unverifiable account from my credit report. 
Supporting Consumer Laws : FCRA Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires that inaccurate or unverifiable information must be deleted from a consumer 's credit file. I am exercising my right to ensure that my credit report remains fair, accurate, and free of unverifiable information. Since XXXX has deemed this account unverifiable and removed it, you must take similar action. 
Additionally, under FCRA Section 623 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), information suppliers must report only complete and accurate information. With XXXX having deemed this information unverifiable, I urge you to align its records accordingly. 
Please provide confirmation of this removal within 30 days of receipt of this request. If the account is not removed, I am prepared to pursue further actions, including filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seeking legal action under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), including Section 616 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n ), which allows consumers to seek legal recourse for willful noncompliance, and Section 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681o ) for negligent non-compliance. 
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter, as it directly impacts my credit reports integrity. Please notify me in writing once this deletion has been processed. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this request.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am disputing the accuracy of an account listed on my credit report under XXXX XXXX XXXX. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. After reviewing my report, I identified the following issues with this account : XXXX. Inconsistent Account Reporting Across Bureaus : The account is listed under XXXX, but there is no reporting in TransUnion or XXXX. This inconsistency can misrepresent the consumers creditworthiness. 
XXXX. Improper Collection Account Reporting : The payment history under XXXX shows OK for all months, but the account is marked as Collection with a status of Late 120 Days and a balance of {$580.00}. This is contradictory and could indicate an error. 
XXXX. Failure to Update Dispute Status : The comments section states : Consumer disputes this account information, yet the account is still reported as Derogatory without clear resolution or updates. If the dispute was resolved, this status should be updated or removed. 
XXXX. Potential Obsolete Reporting : The Date of Last Payment is listed as XX/XX/2018, and the Date Last Active is also XX/XX/2018. Negative information such as collections must generally be removed after seven years from the date of the first delinquency, per FCRA guidelines ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ).

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 1. 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Failure to Ensure Maximum Possible Accuracy : Credit reporting agencies must maintain accurate and consistent reporting. The contradiction between OK payment history and the account being in Collection with 120 Days Late status violates this requirement.

2. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) : Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation : If the account has been disputed and the information remains inaccurate, this indicates a failure to investigate and correct errors.

3. 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) : Reporting of Obsolete Information : If the accounts delinquency began in 2018, it may now be obsolete. Such information must be removed after seven years.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to have only accurate, verified, and authorized information on my credit report. I am requesting the removal of these inquiries from my report as I did not explicitly authorize any of them.

Right to Accuracy and Verification of Information ( FCRA 611 ) : Under section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the FCRA, I have the right to dispute any information that is inaccurate or unverified. I am requesting that you review and verify the legitimacy of these inquiries, and if you can not do so, immediately remove these entries from my credit report. 2. Obligation to Provide Proof of Authorization ( FCRA 609 ) : According to section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the FCRA, I have the right to obtain all information in my file that is relevant to the inquiries conducted, including any evidence that I explicitly consented. I request that you provide this proof of authorization ; in the absence of it, these inquiries should be removed accordingly. 3. Protection Against Identity Theft and Fraud ( FCRA 605B ) : In the event that any of these inquiries are related to identity theft, section 605B of the FCRA requires you to block all information derived from such fraud upon notification. This letter serves as formal notice that none of these inquiries were authorized by me and could potentially be the result of fraud. Furthermore, I want to emphasize that, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I do not authorize this dispute to be processed using the e-OSCAR automated system. Since this dispute concerns unauthorized information, it requires a complete manual review to ensure compliance with my rights to verification and accuracy of information. Thank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to receiving a written response within 15 days, as stipulated by the FCRA.

Details of the Issue : I provided documentation, including police report, identity theft affidavit regarding accounts fraudulently opened in my name. 
Per the institution 's own policies and federal guidelines, these accounts were to be blocked and removed within XXXX business days.

Requested Action : I demand the following : Immediate removal of all fraudulent accounts from my records.

As outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, consumer reporting agencies such as XXXX and XXXX are required to handle consumer data with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumer 's privacy. This includes ensuring that no consumer information is reported without explicit consent. 

The XXXX XXXX, 15 U.S.C. 6801, further protects my personal information, mandating that financial institutions and those who furnish information to credit reporting agencies must respect my privacy and the confidentiality of my nonpublic personal information. I have not provided consent to either XXXX or XXXX to share my personal data or information related to any accounts opened in my name, including the disputed XXXX account. 

Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 1681b and 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) prohibit the reporting of certain adverse information beyond a specified period, and require consumer consent to furnish data to credit agencies. Since I did not authorize the creation of the XXXX account in question, the account is an unlawful and unauthorized entry on my credit report. 

Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681s2 ( a ) ( 1 ) clearly states that no person may report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency if they know, or have reasonable cause to believe, that the information is incorrect. Since I did not authorize the account and it appears to be fraudulent, the furnisher of information has violated this requirement. 

As a consumer, I am also exercising my right to opt out of your reporting services. Under 12 C.F.R. 1016.7, I have the right to opt out of having my information shared with third parties, and I am exercising that right immediately. 

I request that the fraudulent account associated with XXXX XXXX be removed from my credit report, as it was opened without my knowledge or consent. I further request that you confirm in writing that the necessary corrections have been made. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please provide written confirmation that this account has been removed and that my privacy rights have been upheld in accordance with federal law.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,30034,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10984989

It has come to my attention that certain information reported on my credit file may be inaccurate, inconsistent, or unverifiable. Under the FCRA and Metro 2 standards, creditors are obligated to provide accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) in a timely manner.

I want to emphasize the importance of adhering to the prescribed reporting requisites and standards. Even if the information reported is factually correct, it must be reported precisely according to the mandated format, such as Metro 2 data field formatting. Any deviations from these standards may render the reported information deficient and non-compliant.

Therefore, I am exercising my rights as a consumer to demand the removal of any inaccuracies and deficiencies from my credit report. I request a thorough investigation into the sources of these accounts to ensure that creditors have fully complied with industry reporting standards, including Metro 2 requirements.

It is crucial to ascertain that all alleged reporting data furnishers can accurately provide my complete file information to all major credit reporting agencies, including TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX. 
Furthermore, I want to highlight the significance of the FCRA 's provision regarding the accuracy of consumer reports ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Consumer reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information contained in consumer reports.

The following account show inaccuracies Account Name : XXXX XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) Despite providing evidence that late payment entries on my credit report are inaccurate, the credit bureaus have not corrected or removed these items. On XX/XX/2024, I disputed the inaccuracies with both CRAs, providing supporting documentation, including bank statements and payment receipts.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), the CRAs are required to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information reported on my credit file. By failing to correct the false late payment information, they have violated this obligation, which has harmed my creditworthiness. I request that the CFPB intervene to ensure that the CRAs fulfill their duties under the FCRA, correct the inaccuracies, anc remove the disputed items from my credit report.

Below, I detail the specific issues and violations of federal law : I am formally opting out of any and all authorizations I may have givenwhether written, verbal, unwritten, or impliedfor the XXXX to share reporting of my transaction history Under XXXX XXXX. XXXX, financial institutions and their agents are bound by an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy and confidentiality of consumers ' non-public personal information. Reporting transaction history without explicit consent violates this statute. 

Violation : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX have engaged in the unauthorized reporting of my transaction history, which is illegal without my consent. 

Impact : This unauthorized action directly undermines the Congressional mandate for safeguarding consumer privacy, as outlined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its supporting provisions under the FCRA Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S.C. 6801 Unlawful Reporting of Charged-Off Debt as Income Under federal law, charged-off debts are considered income for tax purposes when reported to the IRS via a XXXX XXXX. However, income is not a permissible category for reporting on consumer credit reports under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The FCRA and related case law establish that consumer credit reports must only contain accurate and permissible information directly related to creditworthiness, not income classifications. 

Violation : TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX are unlawfully reporting charged-off debts as derogatory trade lines on my credit report despite their reclassification as "" income '' under IRS regulations XXXX This constitutes a clear violation of the FCRA because income, especially income derived from forgiven debt, is not authorized for inclusion in consumer credit reporting.

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : Emphasized that misleading information on credit reports can violate the FCRA. 
XXXX XXXX Trans Union XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Highlighted the importance of accurate classification of debt in credit reporting. 
Impact : The misreporting of charged-off debt as a derogatory item when it should be classified as income causes severe harm to my credit profile and undermines my creditworthiness.

Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, I am requesting the immediate removal of these inquiries from my credit report. This provision allows consumers to have unauthorized or fraudulent inquiries removed to uphold the accuracy and integrity of their credit information.

The unauthorized hard inquiries are adversely affecting my credit score and causing unwarranted harm to my financial standing. Despite my attempts to address this issue with the relevant entities, a satisfactory resolution has not been reached. Therefore, I am requesting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to take the following actions : 1. Investigate the inclusion of these unauthorized inquiries on my credit report to ascertain their proper authorization.

2. Ensure the swift removal of the unauthorized hard inquiries from my credit report.

3. Hold the responsible parties accountable for breaching my rights under the FCRA.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account XXXX : XXXX Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I assert the following rights and request specific actions to address this issue : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( FCRA 611 ) : I request that the disputed information be investigated and verified as accurate. If the disputed accounts can not be verified, they must be deleted from my credit report.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( FCRA 607 ) : TransUnion is obligated to ensure maximum possible accuracy in reporting my credit information. These accounts are inaccurate and result from identity theft or misreporting tied to the referenced data breach.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( FCRA 605A ( b ) ) : I request that these fraudulent items be removed as they stem from a breach of my personal data.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( FCRA 609 ) : I request access to all documentation, records, and communications related to the inclusion of these accounts on my credit report.

Given the widespread data breaches that have affected financial institutions and compromised consumers ' sensitive information, I believe these accounts may have been fraudulently opened or erroneously reported.

2024-12-01,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I am filing this complaint regarding an alleged debt from XXXX that is being reported on my credit report and pursued by a collection agency. Despite multiple attempts on my part to obtain proper validation of this debt, as required by federal law, the collection agency has failed to provide the necessary documentation.

Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ), consumers have the right to request validation of any alleged debt within 30 days of being contacted by a debt collector. Validation must include clear evidence that the debt is valid, including details about the original creditor, the amount owed, and documentation showing that the debt is connected to the consumer. To date, no proper validation has been provided for this alleged XXXX debt. 

Furthermore, the continued reporting of this unvalidated debt by the credit reporting agencies violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), which mandates that consumer reporting agencies ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information they report. Reporting an unvalidated debt constitutes inaccurate and unfair reporting, causing harm to my credit profile.

Requested Action : Immediate Investigation : I request that the CFPB investigate the collection agency and the creditor, XXXX, for their failure to validate the alleged debt. I also request that the CFPB ensure all collection activities cease until proper validation is provided. 

Removal of Debt from Credit Reports : I request the immediate removal of this unvalidated XXXX debt from my credit report across all three major credit bureaus ( XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX ) to prevent further damage to my creditworthiness. 

Compliance Assurance : I ask the CFPB to ensure that both XXXX and any collection agencies acting on its behalf adhere to the FDCPA and FCRA moving forward, providing proper validation before attempting to collect or report any debt. 

The failure to validate this debt violates federal consumer protection laws and has caused undue stress and harm to my financial standing. I request the CFPBs assistance in resolving this matter promptly and ensuring that my rights as a consumer are upheld.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Credit inquiries on your report that you don't recognize,"I am filing this complaint to address the presence of unauthorized and unconnected credit inquiries on my credit report. These inquiries are not tied to any account or transaction I initiated or approved, and their continued presence is a violation of my rights under federal credit laws.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ), a credit inquiry can only be performed with the consumers consent or in connection with a legitimate credit transaction initiated by the consumer. These inquiries on my credit report lack any associated accounts or transactions, and I have not provided explicit authorization for them.

Additionally, under FCRA Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), I have the right to dispute inaccurate or unauthorized information on my credit report. I have taken steps to dispute these inquiries with the credit reporting agencies, but they have yet to be removed. The failure to act on my dispute constitutes a failure to comply with federal laws requiring accurate
reporting and prompt investigation.

Credit inquiries, even if unauthorized, can negatively affect my credit score and overall creditworthiness. The existence of these unconnected inquiries is causing unnecessary harm to my financial reputation and may impact my ability to secure favorable terms for future financial opportunities.

I request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure that the credit reporting agencies promptly : Remove all unauthorized and unconnected inquiries from my credit report. 
Implement stricter verification processes to prevent unauthorized inquiries from being reported in the future. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a resolution that ensures compliance with the FCRA and protects my rights as a consumer.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX dispute dispute This complaint is in regard to the account related to XXXX XXXX XXXX that is being reported to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX needs prior consent from either the court or the consumer before communication with the collection of any debt to a credit reporting agency. 
Notice, it is a fact, I the consumer did not give prior consent to communication to the debt collector, { XXXX XXXX XXXX } and the consumer alleges there was no prior consent from a court giving permission to contact I, the consumer in collection of any debts owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX and thus this communication by XXXX XXXX XXXX is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692c ( a ) without a court order brought forth. I did not consent to XXXX XXXX XXXX communicating with me any obligations to pay a debt through any mediums which includes communication with the credit reporting agencies to report the alleged debt. Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692a ( 6 ) 1692a ( 6 ) - a debt collector is defined as anyone in the business of collecting a debt. Therefore by definition XXXX XXXX XXXX is debt collector. 

Notice, it is a fact, that, I, agent for principal ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) am aware that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a debt collector by the legal definition. Pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692 ( a ) ( 6 ), a debt collector is any person who uses instrumentality of interstate commerce, such as the mails, in any business which the principal purpose is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another Furthermore this law U.S.Code 1692d states A Debt collector may not engage in any conduct ( no restriction ) which will harass, oppress or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt. Oppressing a right would be conduct not allowed from 1692d. Credit is the right granted and protected by federal law. If any debt collection caused a denial of credit this allows for damages. I have been denied credit on multiple occasions and denied housing because of this negative account on XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. This is an actual damage as this tremendously harmed my ability to operate in commerce and purchase household goods and shelter for I the consumer and my family. 

Notice, it is a fact, I the affiant is aware, credit is a right granted to me as a creditor under the Truth in Lending Act and { XXXX XXXX XXXX } does not have the right to oppress or abuse any part of my character which would restrict or prohibit my right to extend credit. XXXX XXXX XXXX has oppressed my right to extend credit which is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692d.

Furthermore this law 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ) states the actions performed by XXXX XXXX XXXX was illegal- Communicating with any person false credit information including failure to communicate the debt is being disputed has not been verified. As well as there being no contract that exists bewteen the I the consumer and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX says I the consumer would pay XXXX XXXX XXXX the alleged debt this was false and misleading reporting. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware and has proof in this complaint of false and inaccurate credit information reported and it is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ). XXXX XXXX XXXX reported a debt collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. I the affiant have disputed this debt this information can not keep reporting while the dispute is still not resolved as well as failing to communicate with the credit reporting agencies that the debt is being disputed and has not been verified by I, the consumer. This was very misleading and XXXX XXXX XXXX used this as a tactic to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting a fake debt while at the same time attempting to force me to pay the alleged debt under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting the negative collections account to my consumer report in doing so severely damaging my credit worthiness and my ability to operate in commerce and obtain household goods and shelter. I have been denied housing on multiple occasions leading to me being in a homeless shelter this is an actual damage to I, the consumer. I demand once again that XXXX XXXX XXXX fix this issue by deleting the account. XXXX XXXX XXXX is also in violation of 15 U.S. code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( I ) 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) - Reported information can not be only transactions and experiences between the consumer and a company. 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ) - The consumer must be given a chance to direct the information whether they want the information about a transaction they had to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, a consumer must be given a chance to direct whether they want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX in doing so is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and this information must be removed. 

I the consumer also know that it is a fact that XXXX XXXX the original creditor assigned the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The two debt collectors that reported the alleged debt and are attempting collect are XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Both debt collectors are attempting to force the consumer to pay under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting a collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. In doing so both companies have severely damaged my ability to operate in commerce and use my right to credit. I the consumer have a right to credit and have had that right taken from me due to the improper use of my consumer report from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ) 1692e ( 12 ) - the assignee clause which makes the 3rd party debt collector and the one who assigns the debt liable. 
XXXX XXXX assigned the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX This means they are both liable for the alleged debt not I the consumer Notice, it is a fact, consumer has reason to be believe and do so believes, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are in violation in accordance to Article 9, the assignment of a defaulted note is illegal. Both the assignee and the assigned are both liable for violations under 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ). So I am actually not liable for this debt according to what the law says about the matter. 

The debt was assigned to XXXX XXXX XXXX they are attempting to collect a debt that they were assigned. XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX do not have any contract which contains my signature nor does a contract exists that states XXXX XXXX XXXX would pay XXXX XXXX XXXX any payment for a debt. 

There is no contract between the consumer and the debt collectors. This violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) which prohibits abusive, unfair, or deceptive debt collection practices ; if you are contacted by multiple XXXX for the same debt. Both XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have both contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX in an attempt to collect a debt. 
XXXX XXXX had no right to sell the account without notice to i the consumer before doing so. XXXX XXXX also had no right to sell the debt because XXXX XXXX already received income from I the consumer. XXXX XXXX already received full payment of the debt. XXXX XXXX withdrew funds from my Social Security trust account. XXXX Treasury XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account - [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBER XXXX XXXXXXXX, with IRS Form 1099-A. The IRS accounting department can properly account for the transfer of these funds from this account to all debt accounts that I am said to owe or be in default. Due to this fact I, the consumer have no further obligations to XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX also violated 15 U.S.Code 1692j 15 USC 1692 ; 1692 - False and deceptive forms. A form which is made to believe the debt has something to do with you or you are obligated and you are not, is false and deceptive.

Fraud found in a form is a false and deceptive form and a violation of this act. For example if you go and get into an agreement as a consumer credit transaction, you went for something and gave credit. Companies are known to make what's called asset accounts. I never went to have an account made, this is a false and deceptive form because they never disclose this account being made. This includes statements which falsely accuses me of owing a debt. The delivery of these forms via mail constitutes mail fraud. I also never created an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX if I the consumer did not open the account then it is fraud. 

Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, there has been fraud found in this form shown in EXHIBIT ( - ). This form is therefore false and deceptive, void and a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692j I do not have a contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) 15 USC 16324010 ) XXXX ( a ) ( 1 ) - Allows for any action of damage.

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) allows civil liability rewards for any damages, which may include stress, harassment, anxiety, mental anguish, and other damages all caused by violations of FDCPA due to XXXX XXXX XXXX abusive and deceptive business practices. Which caused I the consumer to be denied for housing and certain lines of credit. Which caused I the consumer to be in a homeless shelter and and unable to operate in commerce this is very un equitable. 

Furthermore I am owed monetary value in the amount of XXXX $ for every single violation of the UNITED STATES CODES. 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - XXXX dollars for each proceeding. 
Notice, it is a fact, 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) states an individual action is a violation worth XXXX dollars for proceeding, however understand 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) these violations has caused actual damage By XXXX XXXX XXXX violating 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and not giving me a chance to direct whether I want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX in doing so XXXX XXXX XXXX is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) I was damaged by this violation of the law XXXX XXXX XXXX took it upon themselves to infringe on my right to direct the information I want reported regarding the transaction. Then hindering my ability to credit by reporting without my directions a collections account that negatively impacted my consumer report. 
Every violation of the law by XXXX XXXX XXXX caused a damage to I, the consumer. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX also committed identity theft. They obtained my identifying information such as my social security number to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting the fraudulent account. This use of my social security number was not authorized by I the consumer. 15 U.S.Code 1644 ( a ) 15 USC 1644 ( a ) 1644 ( a ) - Fraudulent authorized use of a credit card such as a license plate, social security card, XXXX card etc, can result up to a XXXX fine. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, the fraudulent use of a credit card, by XXXX XXXX XXXX is defined as whoever uses, attempts or conspires to use a card to obtain money, goods or services shall be fined for {$10000.00} or imprisoned for 10 years or both. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX used my social security account number the exact number on social security card to report information to my consumer report and to collect on a debt. 
This is a direct violation of 1644 ( a ) Also note that this matter could become even more serious if this issues isnt resolved because according to 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) -If i win a civil suit and file a class action, i can obtain up to XXXX $ or 1 % of the company. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, If judgement is made against { XXXX XXXX XXXX } I, the affiant, can and will pursue class action for the amount of XXXX $ to 1 % of your company in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) meaning I could own a percentage of XXXX XXXX XXXX or receive XXXXXXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX inconveniences to I the consumer. 

15 U.S.Code 1602 ( b ) 15 USC 1602 ( b ) 1602 ( b ) Bureau.

The term Bureau means the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Consumer Reporting Agencies are not credit bureaus. The CFPB regulates the credit reporting agencies. 
I urge the CFPB to work swiftly and diligently with me on this matter to make sure XXXX XXXX XXXX and the credit reporting agencies XXXX and TRANSUNION resolves this issue in a timely fair and equitable way for I, the consumer. As well as make sure they follow the laws that were set in place to govern them.

A fraudulent account was illegally opened in my name without my knowledge or consent. Specifically, I have no recollection of applying for or authorizing the account with XXXX XXXX, and I am unfamiliar with its origin. This unauthorized activity has caused harm to my credit and financial reputation. 

I have taken immediate action by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and I have enclosed my Identity Theft Report as evidence of this crime. Additionally, I have contacted the credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) to request validation of the debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). However, the information I requested has not been provided, which further confirms the lack of legitimacy surrounding this account. 

The fraudulent activity violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which ensures the accuracy of information reported to consumer reporting agencies, and the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which makes the unauthorized use of my personal information a federal crime. 

I am requesting the immediate investigation and removal of this account from my records and credit reports to prevent further harm. Identity theft has impacted my ability to secure credit and maintain my financial well-being. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your cooperation in helping me resolve this issue.

Specifically, I believe the following violations have occurred regarding my credit report : Inaccurate Reporting of Account Status - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) The reporting of my account status across different credit reporting agencies is inconsistent and inaccurate. For example, [ Name of XXXX XXXX XXXX ] lists the account as [ describe the status, such as "" Voluntary Repossession '' or "" Foreclosure '' ], while other agencies, such as [ list other agencies ], report different statuses, including [ list conflicting status reports ]. 
This inconsistency has led to confusion regarding the actual status of my account and has negatively impacted my credit score.

Failure to Report Accurate Payment History - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) The payment history reported on my credit report is inaccurate. [ Name of Credit Reporting Agency ] reports months as "" FC '' ( Foreclosure ) when the account was not in foreclosure during those months. This is incorrect, and the payment history is inconsistent with my actual payments.

I request an immediate correction of this reporting, as it violates the FCRA 's requirement for maximum accuracy.

Failure to Update the Balance After Repossession or Voluntary Surrender - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) My credit report continues to show an inaccurate balance of [ {$4700.00} ] after a repossession or voluntary surrender. I believe the balance should reflect the current status after the vehicle was sold, and any remaining deficiency balance should be accurately reported.

Failure to update this information is a violation of the FCRA, which requires creditors to report accurate information regarding the balance of the account.

Failure to Investigate Disputed Information - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) I have disputed the inaccurate information in my credit report with [ transunion, XXXX, experian ] on [ XX/XX/year> ], but no investigation or resolution has occurred. Under the FCRA, the agency is required to investigate and correct any inaccuracies within a timely manner. This failure to respond is a violation of my rights under the FCRA.

Inadequate Debt Validation Information - Violation of FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) I have not received the proper validation of the debt from the creditor or collection agency. I have requested specific details regarding the balance, payment history, and original contract, but have not received a satisfactory response.

Under the FDCPA, I am entitled to request and receive debt validation within 30 days of receiving a collection notice, which has not occurred.

I expect a response to this complaint within [ 30 days ], in accordance with the regulations under the FCRA and FDCPA. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to accurate, complete, and verifiable reporting. Below, I have outlined the specific issues with this account : 1. Inconsistent Comments Across Credit Bureaus : TransUnion : Closed. 
XXXX : Subscriber reports dispute resolved - consumer disagrees. 
XXXX : Closed or paid account/XXXX  balance. 
These inconsistencies in comments create confusion and may mislead lenders about the status of the account. 
2. Late Payment Reporting on a Closed, Paid Account : The account has a {$0.00} balance and is marked Closed or Paid across all bureaus. However, the payment history shows multiple 30-day late marks, which is inaccurate if the account is resolved and paid off. 
XXXX. Failure to Update or Resolve Dispute Comments : The comments reflect ongoing disputes despite the account being marked as resolved and closed. This misrepresentation may harm the creditworthiness of the consumer.

4. Inconsistent Reporting Across Bureaus : The Last Reported dates differ : TransUnion and XXXX : XX/XX/year>. 
XXXX : XX/XX/year>. 
While minor, this discrepancy shows a lack of synchronization and proper updates across the bureaus. 
XXXX. Contradictory Payment History : Despite the account being marked as Current and having a {$0.00} balance, the payment history contains 30-day late marks. If unverifiable or inaccurate, they violate FCRA requirements. 

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 1. 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Failure to Ensure Maximum Possible Accuracy : Credit bureaus are required to ensure the information they report is accurate and consistent. The discrepancies in dispute comments, payment history, and reporting dates violate this standard.

XXXX. Potential Obsolete Reporting : The Date Last Active is listed as XX/XX/XXXX ( TransUnion and XXXX ). If no activity has occurred since then, this account may be nearing or exceeding the seven-year reporting limit, per 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ).

The continued reporting of this account as an open, charged-off balance, without issuing the required 1099-C, is an inaccurate representation of my financial obligations and violates my rights under the FCRA. As a consumer, I am entitled to accurate reporting and full transparency regarding any debt that has been forgiven or settled. By failing to issue a XXXXXXXX1099-C formXXXX  and continuing to report a charged-off account, XXXX XXXX is infringing upon my rights under the **Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) **, which protects consumers from misleading and unfair practices by debt collectors and creditors. I request the immediate removal of this charged-off account from my credit report and the deletion of all associated negative entries that do not reflect the true status of the debt. This includes removing any record of the account that reflects it as charged off or in default if the debt has been forgiven or settled. Please delete and remove all this account. 

Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date of Charge-Off : XX/XX/year> Original Balance : {$7200.00} If this matter is not resolved within 15 days, I will be forced to pursue further action, which may include : XXXX. Filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) for failure to comply with **credit reporting laws XXXX. Reporting this noncompliance to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) for failure to issue the required XXXX1099-C form. 
XXXX. Seeking legal recourse for any violations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other applicable laws. 

Attached will also be the previous letters send out to this creditor. I expect written confirmation of these actions within 15 days from the date of this letter.

A fraudulent account was illegally opened in my name without my knowledge or consent. Specifically, I have no recollection of applying for or authorizing the account with XXXX XXXX, and I am unfamiliar with its origin. This unauthorized activity has caused harm to my credit and financial reputation. 

I have taken immediate action by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and I have enclosed my Identity Theft Report as evidence of this crime. Additionally, I have contacted the credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) to request validation of the debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). However, the information I requested has not been provided, which further confirms the lack of legitimacy surrounding this account. 

The fraudulent activity violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which ensures the accuracy of information reported to consumer reporting agencies, and the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which makes the unauthorized use of my personal information a federal crime. 

I am requesting the immediate investigation and removal of this account from my records and credit reports to prevent further harm. Identity theft has impacted my ability to secure credit and maintain my financial well-being. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your cooperation in helping me resolve this issue.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am filing this formal complaint against XXXX XXXX, Bank Of America, XXXX XXXX for the following violations : Fraudulent Reporting of Charge-Offs as Debt ( IRS Classification of Income ).

Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Ignoring My Letters and Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ). 
Failure to Disclose Securitization of Promissory Notes.

Non-Compliance with Audit Reporting and GAAP Standards.

Fraudulent Reporting of Charge-Offs as Debt The reporting of charge-offs on my credit report is fraudulent and misleading. According to IRS regulations, charge-offs are classified as income on a 1099-C form when reported to the IRS. Per federal law, income can not be reported as debt on a consumer credit report.

Violation : Reporting charge-offs as debt breaches the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, which prohibits the reporting of inaccurate information. 

Demand : XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX must immediately remove all charge-offs from my credit report as these entries are misleading and harmful to my financial reputation. 
XXXX. Breach of Fiduciary Duty : Ignoring My Letters and Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ) I have sent multiple letters asserting my rights, including a Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ), which has been ignored by both XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX. By failing to respond, these entities have violated their fiduciary obligations and undermined my rights to assert my interest in the credit. 

Legal Precedent : XXXX XXXX XXXX establishes that promissory notes fully fund credit, rendering the consumer the true creditor. As the creditor, I retain rights and interests in the credit and demand acknowledgment of the same. 
Demand : XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX must immediately recognize my rights as the creditor and provide a detailed response to all letters and XXXX documents sent. 

XXXX. Failure to Disclose Securitization of Promissory Notes It has come to my attention that the promissory notes I provided to XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX were securitized and sold without my knowledge or consent. This failure to disclose constitutes fraud and unjust enrichment. 

Violation : XXXXnder 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( Truth in Lending Act - TILA ), lenders are required to disclose the sale, assignment, or transfer of debt instruments to third parties. 

Fraudulent Omission : By securitizing my promissory notes and profiting from the proceeds, without compensating me as the original creditor, XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX have committed fraud. 
Demand : Provide full disclosure of the securitization of my promissory notes, including an accounting of proceeds and confirmation that these proceeds have been applied to offset any alleged debt. 

XXXX. Non-Compliance with Audit Reporting and GAAP Standards Under federal law and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), financial institutions are required to provide accurate audit reports and account reconciliations. 

Legal Obligation : 12 U.S.C. 1831n ( a ) mandates compliance with GAAP standards for all financial institutions.

15 U.S.C. 1637 ( TILA ) requires creditors to provide clear and accurate account information. 
Violation : XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX have failed to provide audit reports and reconcile accounts as requested. Their lack of transparency further suggests that the reporting of charge-offs is fraudulent and unsupported by proper accounting practices. 


Formal Opt-Out of Authorization and Illegality of Reporting Transaction History Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am formally opting out of any and all authorizations I may have givenwhether written, unwritten, verbal, or non-verbalunder 15 U.S.C. 6802. As a consumer, I have the unequivocal right to opt out of the sharing and use of my non-public personal information ( NPI ) at any time.

By exercising this opt-out right : Unauthorized Reporting is Illegal : Under 15 U.S.C. 6801, it is illegal for financial institutions to report or share my transaction history without my explicit consent.

The policy of Congress explicitly mandates that every financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to protect the security, confidentiality, and privacy of its customers ' NPI.

A charged-off account is classified as income when reported to the IRS on a 1099-C form. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), income can not legally be reported as a debt on a credit report. 

Violation : Reporting these charged-off accounts as debts is misleading, inaccurate, and against federal law under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), which prohibits the reporting of false information on a credit report. 

Under 15 U.S.C. 6802, I have the legal right to opt out of the sharing of my non-public personal information ( NPI ) at any time. Despite this, the CRAs have failed to honor my opt-out request and continue to use and share my data without my permission.

Lawful Right to Opt-Out : According to 12 C.F.R. 1016.10, consumers can opt out of the sharing of their information with third parties at any time, regardless of any prior authorizationswritten, verbal, implied, or otherwise.

Congress has made it clear that financial institutions have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of their customers and to safeguard the security and confidentiality of their non-public personal information ( NPI ).

Violation : the CRAs have illegally reported my transaction history without my knowledge or consent. This is a clear breach of their statutory obligations under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) and related provisions of the FCRA.

This credit dispute is being submitted as a notification of creditors who are in violation of the CARES Act during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The accounts that are being disputed, are either in violation of the CARES Act or do not belong to me. Policy states...

Statement on Supervisory and Enforcement Practices Regarding the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V in Light of the CARES Act The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection ( Bureau ) recognizes the serious impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the financial well-being of many consumers and on the operations of many supervised entities, including actors in the consumer reporting system, and the challenges of this unique and rapidly evolving situation. Last Friday, on XX/XX/XXXX, the President signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( \ '' CARES Ad\ ' ), which provides critical emergency assistance to consumers and businesses affected by COVID-19 and includes provisions addressing consumer reporting requirements.

Consumer report information is critical to consumers and industry in determining who obtains credit, insurance, and housing, and at what price, and who obtains employment in many cases. Consumer reporting has enormous reach, as evidenced by the over XXXX XXXX consumers in the United States who have credit files and trade lines furnished by over XXXX providers. The continued operation of the consumer reporting system will play a critical role in the functioning of the consumer financial services market, promoting fair and efficient access to credit and benefiting consumers and creditors alike. The Bureau understands that the current crisis impacts the financial well-being of consumers and poses operational challenges for consumer reporting agencies and furnishers, accommodation, the furnisher report the credit obligation or account as current; or ( Il ) if the credit obligation or account was delinquent before the maintain the delinquent status during the period in which the accommodation is in effect; and ( bb ) if the consumer brings the credit obligation or account current during the period described in item ( aa ), report the credit obligation or account as current\ '' ). In addition, section 3513 of the CARES Act addresses the furnishing of certain student loans for which payments are suspended. Rendering them unable to investigate consumer reporting disputes within the timeframes the FCRA requires. Furnishers include a wide variety of businesses that vary in size and sophistication and can range from small retailers to very large financial services firms, each of which will face unique challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In evaluating compliance with the FCRA as a result of the pandemic, the Bureau will consider a consumer reporting agencies or furnisher\ 's individual circumstances and does not intend to cite in an examination or bring an enforcement action against a consumer reporting agency or furnisher making good faith efforts to investigate disputes as quickly as possible, even if dispute investigations take longer than the statutory timeframe. The Bureau reminds furnishers and consumer reporting agencies that they may take advantage of statutory and regulatory provisions that eliminate the obligation to investigate disputes submitted by credit repair organizations and disputes they reasonably determine to be frivolous or irrelevant.

The Bureau will consider the significant current constraints on furnisher and consumer reporting agency time, information, and other resources in assessing if such a determination is reasonable.

Regulatory Requirements This Policy Statement is a non-binding general statement of policy articulating considerations relevant to the Bureau\ 's exercise of its supervisory and enforcement authorities. It is therefore exempt from the notice and comment rule making requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act pursuant to 5 USC 553 ( b ). Because no notice of proposed rule making is required, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not require an initial or final regulatory flexibility analysis. See 5 USC 603 ( a ), 604 ( a ). The Bureau has determined that this Policy Statement does not impose any new or revise any existing record keeping, reporting, or disclosure requirements on covered entities or members of the public that would be collections of information requiring OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 USC 3501-3521.

The trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these account without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn\'t have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these account accounts/items doesnt belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

Policy states...

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT \ '' FCRA\ '', Section 1681c ( 2 ) Block of information resulting from identity theft.

1. Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than four ( 4 ) business days after the date of receipt by such agency of...

1. Appropriate proof of identity of the consumer ; 2. A copy of an identity theft report 3. The identification of such information by the consumer ; and 4. A statement by the consumer that the information relating to transaction by the consumer.

All furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies must comply with all applicable regulations. Information about applicable regulations currently in effect can be found at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus website, www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION : OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA A list of tile sections of tile FCRA cross-referenced to the.U.S Code is at the end of this document.The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is available at the website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore Section 623 imposes the following duties upon furnishers : Accuracy Guidelines results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain files on a nationwide basis. Section 623 ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnished information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when .it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ).

Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumers file. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the slime delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to \ '' nationwide\ '' consumer reporting agencies, as defined in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA . Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ). The CFPB has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 1022, App. B.

Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices ( and such furnisher\ 's agents or assignees ) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information.

Duties When ID Theft Occurs Including staffing challenges, that could temporarily impede their ability to timely comply with their statutory and regulatory consumer reporting obligations.

The Bureau is therefore issuing this policy statement ( Policy Statement ) to highlight furnishers\ ' responsibilities under the CARES Act and inform consumer reporting agencies and furnishers of the Bureau\ 's flexible supervisory and enforcement approach during this pandemic regarding compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Regulation V. The Bureau intends to consider the circumstances that entities face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and entities\ ' good faith efforts to comply with their statutory and regulatory obligations as soon as possible. The Bureau believes that this flexibility will help furnishers and consumer reporting agencies to manage the challenges the current crisis poses. It also will enable consumers, as well as lenders, insurers, employers and other consumer report users, to maintain confidence in the consumer reporting system.

Below are examples of the flexibility the Bureau intends to provide in the consumer reporting system.

Furnishing Consumer Information Impacted by COVID-19 : The Bureau reiterates its prior guidance encouraging financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers and other customers affected by COVID-19 to meet their financial needs. While companies generally are not legally obligated to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies, the Bureau encourages them to continue furnishing information despite the current crisis. Furnishers\ ' providing accurate information to consumer reporting agencies produces substantial benefits for consumers, users of consumer reports, and the economy as a whole.

The CARES Act, a section of which amends the FCRA, generally requires furnishers to report as current certain credit obligations for which furnishers make payment accommodations to consumers affected by COVID 19 who have sought such accommodations from their lendersl .The Bureau expects furnishers to comply with the CARES Act and will work with furnishers as needed to help them do so.

Many furnishers are or will be offering consumers affected by COVID-19 various forms of payment flexibility, including allowing consumers to defer or skip payments, as required by the CARES Act or voluntarily. Such payment accommodations will avoid the reporting of delinquencies resulting from the effects of COVID-19. The Bureau supports furnishers\ ' voluntary efforts to provide payment relief, and it does not intend to cite in examinations or take enforcement actions against those who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies that accurately reflects the payment relief measures they are employing.

Disputes : The FCRA generally requires that consumer reporting agencies and furnishers investigate disputes within 30 days of receipt of the consumer\ 's dispute. The 30-day period may be extended to 45 days if the consumer provides additional information that is relevant to the investigation during the 30-day period.

The Bureau is aware that some consumer reporting agencies and furnishers may face significant operational disruptions that pose challenges for them in investigating consumer disputes. For example, some consumer reporting agencies and furnishers may experience significant reductions in staff, difficulty intaking disputes, or lack of access to necessary information, 1 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Pub. L. No. 116-136, 5 4201 ( 2020 ) ( stating that, with certain exceptions, \ '' if a furnisher makes an accommodation with respect to 1 or more payments on a credit obligation or account Of a consumer, and the consumer makes the payments or is not required to make 1 or more payments pursuant to the The below listed accounts by the Original Creditors, who have reported these accounts within my credit reports, were not opened by me. I also did not give my authorization for anyone else to open these accounts. Someone else of who did these that I did not know.

Policy States According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy ( a ) Reinvestigation of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required a. In general. Subject to Subsection ( f ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly thorough a reseller, of such dispute free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means to you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 
Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRES that are a result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed and companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquires. 
Inquires that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit, it is a fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquires are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquires were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 
It should be noted that any inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done though fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry with each company. These inquires are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 
I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit reporting agency, report an accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do mot belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be UPDATED and/or DELETED!

I apologize for this oversight and wish to clarify that the issues and accounts I am disputing remain unchanged. I am submitting this revised dispute to provide the correct documentation for your review. 

Investigation of Inaccurate Credit Report Items is in Violation Under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ( b ) Accuracy of report To Whom It May Concern, I recently conducted a review of my credit report and found several items that have caused me significant distress. These items appear to be unverifiable, inaccurate, and questionable. Your agency has failed to ensure the accuracy of the information as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports. This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. 

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report. 

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors. I have never entered into a valid contract with any of these entities, nor have I engaged in any transactions with them. As such, these accounts are fraudulent and may be the result of identity theft or other illegal activities. Attempting to enforce these fraudulent accounts is unlawful. I request that you expedite your investigation to prevent further harm, losses, or damages that I may suffer as a victim of identity theft. 

Moreover, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, my right to privacy has been violated, and this breach infringes upon my rights as outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, La XXXX XX/XX/2024 To : Whom it May Concern Subject : Request for Removal of Unverifiable Account Dear Credit Reporting Department, I am writing to formally request the removal of an account from my credit report as reported by [ XXXX, XXXX, or TransUnion ]. This request is based on the recent deletion of an account by XXXX, one of the four major credit reporting agencies. I recently disputed a charge-o for { Charge off amount goes here } from { Creditor Goes here/ or company account was sold too }, listed on my XXXX report, and following a thorough investigation, XXXX has completely removed this unverifiable debt from my report as of XX/XX/2024. 
According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), all consumer reporting agencies must ensure that information in consumer reports is accurate, fair, and verifiable. 
Since XXXX has removed this account after its verification process, I request that you do the same and remove this unverifiable account from my credit report. 
Supporting Consumer Laws : FCRA Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires that inaccurate or unverifiable information must be deleted from a consumer 's credit file. I am exercising my right to ensure that my credit report remains fair, accurate, and free of unverifiable information. Since XXXX has deemed this account unverifiable and removed it, you must take similar action. 
Additionally, under FCRA Section 623 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), information suppliers must report only complete and accurate information. With XXXX having deemed this information unverifiable, I urge you to align its records accordingly. 
Please provide confirmation of this removal within 30 days of receipt of this request. If the account is not removed, I am prepared to pursue further actions, including filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seeking legal action under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), including Section 616 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n ), which allows consumers to seek legal recourse for willful non- compliance, and Section 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681o ) for negligent non-compliance.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter, as it directly impacts my credit report 's integrity. Please notify me in writing once this deletion has been processed. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this request.

2024-12-01,Credit card,Store credit card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Good afternoon, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing regarding a recent issue I encountered with my Capital One XXXX  account. As of today ( XXXX ), I discovered that my account was terminated by Capital one XXXX. They sent me a template email explaining this : "" Hello XXXX, We regret to inform you that your Capital One XXXX account has been terminated. We retain the right to terminate your account for any of the reasons described in our terms of service. Termination commonly occurs for one of the following reasons : A user attempted to obtain referral-based Shopping Rewards based on creation of duplicate accounts, fraud, or through other impermissible means outlined in our terms of service A user used Capital One XXXX  in a manner consistent with the reselling of goods or services A user attempted to redeem Shopping Rewards for which they were not eligible A user engaged in other impermissible activity outlined in our terms of service Additional information on our policies and practices can be found in our Terms of Service. 

We appreciate your understanding. '' Allow me to explain why I firmly believe this situation does not stem from any inappropriate or mistaken activity on my part. 

Capital one XXXX  sent me emails to encorage me purchase items from various websites and promised to provide a rebate reward after completion of the order. 

All my purchases have been made strictly for personal use and not for resale purposes. To date, I have purchased : An XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX monthly plan ; An XXXX ( bought with XXXX  ) ; XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX makeup products ; XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX and a XXXX  cast iron pot ( though Capital One XXXX failed to track for these items ). 

If required, I can provide photographic evidence demonstrating that I use these products regularly in my daily life.

also, this is the only account I own, and there are no duplicate or fraudulent accounts associated with my identity. My account is exclusively linked to my Capital One Venture credit card, further ensuring that duplication or fraud is not a possibility. 


If any of the aforementioned items are deemed ineligible for reward redemption under Capital one XXXX XXXX policies, I would expect those orders to be appropriately marked as such. However, a broad, unexplained restriction on all rewards is unwarranted and seems inconsistent with fair account management practices.

By the time my account was terminated, I still have {$780.00} in my account.

I attached a screenshot of the orders I made with them ( the screenshot was taken before my account was banned ).

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,NY,14850,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10986757

I believe this entry is not only incorrect but also reflects a violation of several federal consumer protection laws. Below, I outline the violations and request immediate action to investigate and rectify this matter.

1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1635 ( Right of Rescission ) : Under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), I am entitled to specific disclosures and protections regarding financial obligations. This law provides a right to rescind certain transactions within a specific timeframe. The negative item on my report does not reflect that this right was properly honored or communicated.

2. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( Validation of Debts ) : As per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I have the right to request validation of any alleged debt. Despite my requests for verification, I have not received adequate proof that the negative item on my report is valid or accurate. This failure constitutes a violation of federal law.

3. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( Communication Practices ) : The FDCPA also regulates the manner and timing of communications regarding debt. Any communication about the disputed item must comply with the prescribed standards, including restrictions on contacting me without consent or at inappropriate times. I believe these standards have not been adhered to.

4. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( Compliance with Accurate Reporting ) : The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates that credit bureaus maintain strict procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information reported. The presence of this negative item, which I have reason to believe is inaccurate or unverifiable, indicates a failure on your part to comply with these obligations.

Requested Resolution : 1. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and the removal of the disputed negative item from my credit report.

2. Please provide me with a purchase agreement verifying the accuracy and legality of the information in question, as required by federal law.

3. Confirm in writing that the disputed item has been removed or corrected within 30 days of receiving this letter.

Failure to address this matter adequately and in compliance with federal laws may result in further action, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursuing legal remedies.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious matter. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter and keep me informed of your actions regarding this dispute.

I was dismayed to find that an item that had previously been removed by two other credit reporting agencies has been re-verified by your agency. This has raised serious concerns for me, as the other agencies concluded that the item was unverified and subsequently deleted it from my credit report. 

It is important to note that this item in question is a result of identity theft, which has caused significant distress and harm to my mental, emotional, and physical well-being. I find it deeply troubling that despite the clear evidence of fraudulent activity associated with this debt, your agency has chosen to not adhere to the regulations that mandate the validation of such debts. 

I must emphasize that the inaccuracies in my credit report are not only detrimental to my financial standing but also tarnish my reputation and creditworthiness. I urge you to promptly rectify this issue and ensure that the erroneous item is removed from my credit report in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

I kindly request that you conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and provide me with a detailed explanation as to why the item has been re-verified despite the lack of validation from other reporting agencies. It is imperative that this issue be resolved expeditiously to prevent further harm to my credit profile. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and expect a swift resolution to restore the accuracy of my credit report. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss this further.

As a national reporting agency, you are governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( "" FCRA '' ), which protects consumers from inaccurate, outdated, or invalidated information reporting of their credit file.

I apologize for this oversight and wish to clarify that the issues and accounts I am disputing remain unchanged. I am submitting this revised dispute to provide the correct documentation for your review. 

Investigation of Inaccurate Credit Report Items is in Violation Under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ( b ) Accuracy of report To Whom It May Concern, I recently conducted a review of my credit report and found several items that have caused me significant distress. These items appear to be unverifiable, inaccurate, and questionable. Your agency has failed to ensure the accuracy of the information as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports. This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. 

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report. 

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors. I have never entered into a valid contract with any of these entities, nor have I engaged in any transactions with them. As such, these accounts are fraudulent and may be the result of identity theft or other illegal activities. Attempting to enforce these fraudulent accounts is unlawful.

The vehicle was charged off in XXXX of XXXX by XXXX XXXX, However, XXXXXXXX XXXX continued with threatening collection activities to include threats of repossession of the vehicle all the way through XX/XX/XXXX. 

I never received a 1099c from XXXX XXXX for the charge off that they claimed on my personal credit report which is still showing today XX/XX/XXXX as a charge off on my personal credit report which is impacting my overall FICO score as a result of the incorrect reporting. 

I made an agreement with XXXXXXXX XXXX to pay an agreed upon balance they claimed was still owed on the vehicle although they received a tax credit from the IRS for the written off balance owed on the vehicle. The reason why I made the agreement was because XXXX XXXX continued to threaten collections and repossession of the vehicle until the balance they claim was owed was paid on the vehicle. Therefore I am requesting a 1099c from XXXX XXXX which they were supposed to have provided to me once the account was charged off. 

I paid the agreed upon amount they requested and still had to wait over 4 months from XXXX XXXX to release the title to my vehicle. XXXX XXXX has caused a great deal of stress upon me during my dealing with their customer support and other departments within this past year alone regarding the account. I no longer choose to do any type of business with XXXX XXXX ongoing in the future and at this point, I am requesting a copy of the 1099c from XXXX XXXX that they were supposed to have provided to me once the account was charged off, so that my taxes can be prepared properly. 

Based upon my personal credit report, the account was charged off in XXXX of XXXX, however, XXXX XXXX continued to go after collections on the account through XXXX which resulted in my paying an agreed upon amount to settle the debt that they stated that I still owed on the account, although they received a tax credit from the IRS for the charge off amount on the account.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NC,27612,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10982405

As outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, consumer reporting agencies such as Equifax and XXXX are required to handle consumer data with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumer 's privacy. This includes ensuring that no consumer information is reported without explicit consent.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. 6801, further protects my personal information, mandating that financial institutions and those who furnish information to credit reporting agencies must respect my privacy and the confidentiality of my nonpublic personal information. I have not provided consent to either Equifax or XXXX to share my personal data or information related to any accounts opened in my name, including the disputed XXXX account. 

Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 1681b and 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) prohibit the reporting of certain adverse information beyond a specified period, and require consumer consent to furnish data to credit agencies. Since I did not authorize the creation of the XXXX account in question, the account is an unlawful and unauthorized entry on my credit report.

Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681s2 ( a ) ( 1 ) clearly states that no person may report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency if they know, or have reasonable cause to believe, that the information is incorrect. Since I did not authorize the account and it appears to be fraudulent, the furnisher of information has violated this requirement.

As a consumer, I am also exercising my right to opt out of your reporting services. Under 12 C.F.R. 1016.7, I have the right to opt out of having my information shared with third parties, and I am exercising that right immediately. 

I request that the fraudulent account associated with XXXX XXXX be removed from my credit report, as it was opened without my knowledge or consent. I further request that you confirm in writing that the necessary corrections have been made. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please provide written confirmation that this account has been removed and that my privacy rights have been upheld in accordance with federal law.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30034,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10986529

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information contained in consumer reports. Reporting a bankruptcy as originating from the court without direct verification from the source violates this requirement. 

Furthermore, under 15 USC 1681i, I have the right to dispute any inaccurate or unverifiable information on my credit report. Since the bankruptcy court does not furnish such information to credit reporting agencies, its inclusion on my credit report is unsubstantiated and must be removed. 

Actions Requested : Conduct an Investigation : Investigate the source of the bankruptcy information reported on my credit report. If the reporting can not be verified directly by the source ( the bankruptcy court ), it must be removed. 

Provide Written Confirmation : Notify me in writing of the results of your investigation and provide an updated copy of my credit report reflecting the removal of the inaccurate bankruptcy entry. 

Ensure Compliance : Verify that all procedures are in compliance with the FCRA to prevent similar inaccuracies in the future. 

Enclosed are supporting documents, including confirmation from the bankruptcy court that they do not furnish credit reporting data, and a copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed bankruptcy entry. 

I expect a response within the 30 days required under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ). Failure to comply with these legal obligations will leave me no choice but to report this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my state Attorney Generals office. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Inconsistent Account Reporting Across Bureaus : The account is listed under Equifax, but there is no reporting in XXXX or XXXX. This inconsistency can misrepresent the consumers creditworthiness. 
XXXX. Improper Collection Account Reporting : The payment history under Equifax shows OK for all months, but the account is marked as Collection with a status of Late 120 Days and a balance of {$580.00}. This is contradictory and could indicate an error. 
XXXX. Failure to Update Dispute Status : The comments section states : Consumer disputes this account information, yet the account is still reported as Derogatory without clear resolution or updates. If the dispute was resolved, this status should be updated or removed. 
XXXX. Potential Obsolete Reporting : The Date of Last Payment is listed as XX/XX/year>, and the Date Last Active is also XX/XX/year>.

2. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) : Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation : If the account has been disputed and the information remains inaccurate, this indicates a failure to investigate and correct errors.

Below, I detail the specific issues and violations of federal law : I am formally opting out of any and all authorizations I may have givenwhether written, verbal, unwritten, or impliedfor the CRAs to share reporting of my transaction history Under 15 U.S.C. 6801, financial institutions and their agents are bound by an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy and confidentiality of consumers ' non-public personal information. Reporting transaction history without explicit consent violates this statute. 

Violation : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX have engaged in the unauthorized reporting of my transaction history, which is illegal without my consent. 

Impact : This unauthorized action directly undermines the XXXX mandate for safeguarding consumer privacy, as outlined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its supporting provisions under the FCRA Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : XXXX U.S.C. XXXX Unlawful Reporting of Charged-Off Debt as Income Under federal law, charged-off debts are considered income for tax purposes when reported to the IRS via a XXXX XXXX.

Violation : XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX are unlawfully reporting charged-off debts as derogatory trade lines on my credit report despite their reclassification as "" income '' under IRS regulations XXXX This constitutes a clear violation of the FCRA because income, especially income derived from forgiven debt, is not authorized for inclusion in consumer credit reporting.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am filing this complaint against the Credit Reporting Agencies ( CRAs ) for the following violations : Fraudulent Reporting of Charged-Off Accounts Failure to Honor Opt-Out Rights Under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802 ) CRAs are illegally reporting charged-off accounts on my credit report. A charged-off account is classified as income when reported to the IRS on a 1099-C form. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), income can not legally be reported as a debt on a credit report. 

Violation : Reporting these charged-off accounts as debts is misleading, inaccurate, and against federal law under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), which prohibits the reporting of false information on a credit report. 

Under 15 U.S.C. 6802, I have the legal right to opt out of the sharing of my non-public personal information ( NPI ) at any time. Despite this, the CRAs have failed to honor my opt-out request and continue to use and share my data without my permission. 

Lawful Right to Opt-Out : According to 12 C.F.R. 1016.10, consumers can opt out of the sharing of their information with third parties at any time, regardless of any prior authorizationswritten, verbal, implied, or otherwise. 


Under 15 U.S.C. 6801, it is unlawful for any financial institution or Credit Reporting Agency ( CRA ) to report transaction history without my explicit consent. Congress has made it clear that financial institutions have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of their customers and to safeguard the security and confidentiality of their non-public personal information ( NPI ). 

Violation : the CRAs have illegally reported my transaction history without my knowledge or consent. This is a clear breach of their statutory obligations under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) and related provisions of the FCRA.

Privacy Obligation : Under 15 U.S.C. 6801 ( b ), financial institutions are required to implement safeguards to ensure the privacy of their customers ' information. Reporting transaction history without proper authorization violates these obligations.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,32836,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10987757

A fraudulent account was illegally opened in my name without my knowledge or consent. Specifically, I have no recollection of applying for or authorizing the account with XXXX XXXX, and I am unfamiliar with its origin. This unauthorized activity has caused harm to my credit and financial reputation. 

I have taken immediate action by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and I have enclosed my Identity Theft Report as evidence of this crime. Additionally, I have contacted the credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) to request validation of the debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). However, the information I requested has not been provided, which further confirms the lack of legitimacy surrounding this account. 

The fraudulent activity violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which ensures the accuracy of information reported to consumer reporting agencies, and the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which makes the unauthorized use of my personal information a federal crime. 

I am requesting the immediate investigation and removal of this account from my records and credit reports to prevent further harm. Identity theft has impacted my ability to secure credit and maintain my financial well-being. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your cooperation in helping me resolve this issue.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"This complaint addresses serious and egregious violations of federal law committed by XXXX, Equifax, XXXX ( the Credit Reporting Agencies or CRAs ), and XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX regarding their mishandling and unlawful reporting of my personal data, privacy breaches, and fraudulent classification of charged-off debts. Their actions not only infringe upon my statutory rights but also cause significant harm to my financial well-being and reputation. 


Failure to Honor Opt-Out Rights Under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802 ) Under 15 U.S.C. 6802, consumers have the right to opt out of the sharing of non-public personal information ( NPI ). I am formally opting out of any prior or assumed authorizationswritten, verbal, implied, or otherwisegranted to the CRAs or XXXX And XXXX XXXX to use or share my data. Despite this clear directive, these entities have willfully disregarded my right to privacy by continuing to disseminate my XXXX without consent. 


2. Violations of the Privacy Act of 1974 The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that entities handling personal information must notify individuals of its use and provide them with a meaningful opportunity to restrict or control its dissemination. 

Violation : XXXX, Equifax, XXXX, along with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX failed to notify me of how my personal information was being shared with third parties and denied me the ability to opt out of these unauthorized disclosures. 
Impact : This lack of transparency infringes upon my fundamental rights to control the use of my personal data. 


XXXX. Illegal Reporting of Charged-Off Debts as Income ( 15 U.S.C. 6801 ) Charged-off debts reported to the IRS via a 1099-C are reclassified as income under federal tax law. Income, however, is not permissible for inclusion on a consumer credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). XXXX, Equifax, XXXX, and [ Bank Names ] are knowingly violating federal law by falsely reporting charged-off debts as derogatory items instead of removing them as required. 

Violation : The continued reporting of charged-off debts as derogatory trade lines violates 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), which governs the permissible content of consumer reports. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, the court confirmed that debts reported inaccurately or without proper validation are unlawful under the FCRA. This precedent underscores that creditors and CRAs must remove such items promptly.

Impact : This misclassification harms my creditworthiness and exposes me to undue financial hardship and damage.

4.Negligence and Gross Misconduct by Each Bank and CRA Each of the following entities has engaged in illegal reporting and privacy violations : XXXX AND XXXX : Refused to validate a charged-off debt and continued reporting it despite being reclassified as income. 



XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX : Complicit in reporting unvalidated, inaccurate, and impermissible information, including charged-off debts and transaction histories without my authorization. 



The actions of XXXX, Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX and XXXX XXXX violate the following federal statutes and case law precedents : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S.C. 16811681x.

I was told because I had never had any lates in my history of 2 years that I qualified for a deferral and that could be from 3 to 6 months. I was told that they could not help me at the time because I had never been late with my mortgage I would have to be late at least 60 290 days before they can even help me. So I asked my single point of sales rep whose name was XXXX XXXX at the time If it would be okay if I was late to repay my debt He said that would be the best thing to do as it looks like you're in great standing with us and that should be no problem So I did not pay for 3 months thinking I would be able to get the deferment Well he was taking off of my case and they put another point of contact in I did not know that my loan had been denied at the time I didn't know until I called asking what was going on because I did not get a notice or anything in the mail nor did I get anything emailed So I was out there in limbo I found out when I called that I was in default and that they denied me This point of contact told me to just reapply I should be able to get it because I qualified for at least a modification or payment plan but because deferral wasn't reached yet I should probably add more debt to my income so that I can look like I was in harder hardship so she gave me the numbers to add on my paper and I did I resubmitted asking for deferment or modification and again for the 4th month I did not get a response I then received a phone call that said that these calls will continue until my debt was caught up Well I'm getting nervous because I'm falling further and further behind but every point of contact that I spoke with told me that I should not pay the bill or should I say my mortgage until the modification is complete If I paid while it was under review it would throw everything off so that's the fourth month of me being told not to pay anything here we go fifth month they tell me oh it's too late You're way over and you need to pay everything back Well now I can't pay everything back at once what happened to my deferment what happened to my modification now nobody wants to talk to me I didn't get any documents to say I was denied I got nothing to say what my chances are what my options are I got nothing nobody talk to me when they called me I answered and they said this is an attempt to collect a debt when I told them what was going on they just suggested that I make a payment and resubmit an application every time I resubmitted an application I waited days weeks now I'm so far behind I do not have all this money to pay back it once I can absolutely pay my monthly mortgage but I'm asking for modification if just for 3 months I can pay the back pay for the additional 2 months if they just work with me but nobody is giving me any accurate information nothing substantial people are literally giving me information that is getting me deeper and deeper in the hole now I'm possibly facing foreclosure and yet all they say is make a payment How you're not accepting payments I don't know what to do right now I need help They keep giving me bad information tell me wait don't make a payment Wait don't make a payment resubmit Don't make a payment and I'm getting deeper in the hole but nobody 's telling me what to do or what options I have The minute I submitted again within a few days from what I was told it goes into denial and nobody tells me I'm running out of time and nobody 's talking I need help I have a daughter and I'm XXXX  I explain that to the last point of sales representative and she told me that they are not going to give me a deferment they're probably not going to give me a modification because I'm not going through a temporary hardship might XXXX is a XXXX  hardship And because of that I don't qualify for any assistance That's discrimination if I never seen it in my life that's full discrimination because I got my mortgage with my XXXX now I can't get a modification with my XXXX.

It has come to my attention that certain information reported on my credit file may be inaccurate, inconsistent, or unverifiable. Under the FCRA and Metro 2 standards, creditors are obligated to provide accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) in a timely manner. 
I want to emphasize the importance of adhering to the prescribed reporting requisites and standards. Even if the information reported is factually correct, it must be reported precisely according to the mandated format, such as Metro 2 data field formatting. Any deviations from these standards may render the reported information deficient and non-compliant. 
Therefore, I am exercising my rights as a consumer to demand the removal of any inaccuracies and deficiencies from my credit report. I request a thorough investigation into the sources of these accounts to ensure that creditors have fully complied with industry reporting standards, including Metro 2 requirements. 
It is crucial to ascertain that all alleged reporting data furnishers can accurately provide my complete file information to all major credit reporting agencies, including XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax. 
Furthermore, I want to highlight the significance of the FCRA 's provision regarding the accuracy of consumer reports ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Consumer reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information contained in consumer reports.

Specifically, I believe the following violations have occurred regarding my credit report : Inaccurate Reporting of Account Status - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) The reporting of my account status across different credit reporting agencies is inconsistent and inaccurate. For example, [ Name of Credit Reporting Agency ] lists the account as [ describe the status, such as "" Voluntary Repossession '' or "" Foreclosure '' ], while other agencies, such as [ list other agencies ], report different statuses, including [ list conflicting status reports ].

This inconsistency has led to confusion regarding the actual status of my account and has negatively impacted my credit score.

Failure to Report Accurate Payment History - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) The payment history reported on my credit report is inaccurate. [ Name of Credit Reporting Agency ] reports months as "" FC '' ( Foreclosure ) when the account was not in foreclosure during those months. This is incorrect, and the payment history is inconsistent with my actual payments.

I request an immediate correction of this reporting, as it violates the FCRA 's requirement for maximum accuracy.

Failure to Update the Balance After Repossession or Voluntary Surrender - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) My credit report continues to show an inaccurate balance of [ {$4700.00} ] after a repossession or voluntary surrender. I believe the balance should reflect the current status after the vehicle was sold, and any remaining deficiency balance should be accurately reported.

Failure to update this information is a violation of the FCRA, which requires creditors to report accurate information regarding the balance of the account.

Failure to Investigate Disputed Information - Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) I have disputed the inaccurate information in my credit report with [ transunion, equifax, experian ] on [ XX/XX/year> ], but no investigation or resolution has occurred. Under the FCRA, the agency is required to investigate and correct any inaccuracies within a timely manner. This failure to respond is a violation of my rights under the FCRA. 
Inadequate Debt Validation Information - Violation of FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) I have not received the proper validation of the debt from the creditor or collection agency. I have requested specific details regarding the balance, payment history, and original contract, but have not received a satisfactory response. 
Under the FDCPA, I am entitled to request and receive debt validation within 30 days of receiving a collection notice, which has not occurred.

2024-12-01,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Unexpected increase in interest rate,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to express my deep disappointment with Truist Banks handling of my account. Despite being a loyal BB & T customer for over 30 years, I have faced numerous issues that have caused significant distress to me and my family.

Interest Rate Increase : Truist has raised the interest rate on my credit card without my approval. This change has caused severe financial strain. I am unsure if this occurred during the merger with BB & T and SunTrust into Truist. I urgently request a copy of the original fixed-rate contract I signed. Despite contacting Truist multiple times and speaking with executives, specialists, supervisors, and managers, I have only received the current contract, not the original one. 

Credit Bureau Reporting Error : Truist mistakenly reported incorrect information to the credit bureau, negatively impacting my credit score. Although Truist acknowledged the error and contacted the credit bureau to correct it, this is just XXXX of many issues I have faced. 

Lack of Support and Financial Assistance : Over the years, I have repeatedly reached out for assistance, only to be met with inadequate responses. I have never received any financial benefit or meaningful support from Truist. For instance, when I applied for a mortgage loan, Truist made a significant error. Despite being approved and completing all necessary steps, including the appraisal, the process was halted due to a mistake on Truists part. It took intervention from two executives to acknowledge the error and refund the appraisal fee. This is just one example of the many issues I have encountered. I have asked Truist constantly to help me pay off the card or to negotiate a reasonable interest rate and then lock my card until it is paid off, but they have done absolutely nothing to help.

Financial Contributions : Over the years, Truist has made significant profits from my accounts. Specifically, they have earned over {$15000.00} from my credit card alone. Additionally, we have an international account and frequently transfer large sums of money, generating further revenue for Truist. Despite this, they have never offered any assistance to help reduce my credit card payments or balance. This is the only credit card I have ever had in 30 years where I have not been able to pay off the balance on time, despite having a good credit score and a strong financial history.

Specifically, I have no recollection of applying for or authorizing the account with XXXX XXXX, and I am unfamiliar with its origin. This unauthorized activity has caused harm to my credit and financial reputation. 

I have taken immediate action by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and I have enclosed my Identity Theft Report as evidence of this crime. Additionally, I have contacted the credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) to request validation of the debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). However, the information I requested has not been provided, which further confirms the lack of legitimacy surrounding this account. 

The fraudulent activity violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which ensures the accuracy of information reported to consumer reporting agencies, and the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which makes the unauthorized use of my personal information a federal crime. 

I am requesting the immediate investigation and removal of this account from my records and credit reports to prevent further harm.

XXXX. Inconsistent Reporting Across Bureaus : The Last Reported dates differ : XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX

2024-12-01,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I am filing this complaint regarding an alleged debt from XXXX that is being reported on my credit report and pursued by a collection agency. Despite multiple attempts on my part to obtain proper validation of this debt, as required by federal law, the collection agency has failed to provide the necessary documentation. 

Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ), consumers have the right to request validation of any alleged debt within 30 days of being contacted by a debt collector. Validation must include clear evidence that the debt is valid, including details about the original creditor, the amount owed, and documentation showing that the debt is connected to the consumer. To date, no proper validation has been provided for this alleged XXXX debt. 

Furthermore, the continued reporting of this unvalidated debt by the credit reporting agencies violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), which mandates that consumer reporting agencies ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information they report. Reporting an unvalidated debt constitutes inaccurate and unfair reporting, causing harm to my credit profile.

Requested Action : Immediate Investigation : I request that the CFPB investigate the collection agency and the creditor, XXXX, for their failure to validate the alleged debt. I also request that the CFPB ensure all collection activities cease until proper validation is provided. 

Removal of Debt from Credit Reports : I request the immediate removal of this unvalidated XXXX debt from my credit report across all three major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax ) to prevent further damage to my creditworthiness. 

Compliance Assurance : I ask the CFPB to ensure that both XXXX and any collection agencies acting on its behalf adhere to the FDCPA and FCRA moving forward, providing proper validation before attempting to collect or report any debt. 

The failure to validate this debt violates federal consumer protection laws and has caused undue stress and harm to my financial standing. I request the CFPBs assistance in resolving this matter promptly and ensuring that my rights as a consumer are upheld.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Reporting and Request for 1099-C Documentation To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to dispute the accuracy of an account listed on my credit report. This letter is being sent under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC 1681s-2, which requires that furnishers of credit information report only accurate and verifiable information.

The account in question is as follows : 1. Account Name : XXXX XXXX  Date Listed : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Account Name : XXXX XXXX  Date Listed : XXXX XXXX, XXXX This account is reporting a balance despite the fact that such reporting may violate consumer law and IRS regulations concerning the discharge of indebtedness. According to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the issuance of a 1099-C form is evidence of an identifiable event of debt cancellation under IRS regulations . Specifically, Identifiable Event Code 7 states that a discharge of indebtedness occurs due to a decision by the creditor to discontinue collection activity and cancel the debt as part of a defined policy.

If a 1099-C form has been issued for this account, it signifies that the debt has been canceled. Reporting a balance for a canceled debt is not only inaccurate but also misleading under the FCRA. This inaccurate reporting is damaging my credit and must be addressed immediately.

Demands : Verification of the Account Balance : Provide evidence showing that the balance being reported is accurate and collectible.

Provision of the 1099-C Form : If a 1099-C form has been issued for this debt, provide a copy of the document as proof of the identifiable event.

Immediate Deletion of the Account : If the debt has been discharged under Identifiable Event Code 7 or can not be verified, this negative information must be promptly deleted from my credit report to comply with the FCRA.

Under the FCRA, I expect your investigation to be conducted within 30 days of receipt of this letter. If you are unable to verify the accuracy of the information or provide the requested documentation, you are required to remove this account from my credit report.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your resolution and a written confirmation of the results.

Despite submitting all required documentation, including a valid Power of Attorney ( POA ), identification, and Social Security information, XXXX has falsely claimed that my identification documents were insufficient or illegible. This baseless rejection constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and undermines the legal validity of my disputes and rescission of signature. 


-- - Background Information : XXXX. Accounts in Dispute : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/year> Past Due Amount : {$1300.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : {$12000.00} Opened : XX/XX/year> Past Due Amount : {$350.00} XXXX. Submission of Documentation : In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), I submitted disputes to XXXX Equifax XXXX XXXX, asserting that these accounts are inaccurate because they were rescinded under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). As part of my disputes, I provided the following : A certified mail receipt from XXXX A mailing response from XXXX A notarized Power of Attorney document. 

A copy of my valid government-issued identification. 



XXXX. XXXX 's Response : issued a response stating that my identification documents were insufficient or illegible, despite my compliance with their requirements. This is a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts, designed to avoid their obligation to investigate and correct the disputed information under the FCRA. 


Violations : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), XXXX XXXX and Equifax is required to conduct a reasonable investigation when a consumer disputes the accuracy of information. By rejecting my valid documentation, XXXX has failed to meet this obligation. 

Failure to Notify Furnishers : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 2 ), XXXX XXXX and Equifax is required to notify creditors of the dispute. Their baseless rejection of my documentation effectively obstructed this process. 

Failure to Ensure Maximum Possible Accuracy : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), XXXX Equifax XXXX must ensure that the information reported is accurate. Reporting rescinded accounts as open is a clear violation of this provision. 



2. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : Non-Compliance with Rescission Provisions : The accounts in question were rescinded in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1635, which nullifies any legal obligations tied to the accounts. XXXX refusal to correct this inaccurate reporting violates my rights under TILA.

3. Consumer Protection Violations : Obstruction of Legal Process : By rejecting my Power of Attorney and associated documentation, XXXX has obstructed the legal process, preventing me from exercising my rights to dispute and correct inaccurate information. 

Failure to Recognize Legal Authority of Power of Attorney : The Power of Attorney submitted in support of my disputes is a legal instrument granting authority to act on behalf of the principal. XXXX failure to honor this document violates well-established legal principles. 





-- - Conclusion : XXXX  XXXX and Equifax actions constitute serious violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Truth in Lending Act, and other federal protections. Their failure to honor valid identification and legal documentation is unacceptable and undermines the integrity of consumer rights. This complaint seeks accountability for these violations and correction of the ongoing issues regarding the disputed accounts.

These inquiries are not tied to any account or transaction I initiated or approved, and their continued presence is a violation of my rights under federal credit laws.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ), a credit inquiry can only be performed with the consumers consent or in connection with a legitimate credit transaction initiated by the consumer. These inquiries on my credit report lack any associated accounts or transactions, and I have not provided explicit authorization for them.

Additionally, under FCRA Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), I have the right to dispute inaccurate or unauthorized information on my credit report. I have taken steps to dispute these inquiries with the credit reporting agencies, but they have yet to be removed. The failure to act on my dispute constitutes a failure to comply with federal laws requiring accurate reporting and prompt investigation.

Credit inquiries, even if unauthorized, can negatively affect my credit score and overall creditworthiness. The existence of these unconnected inquiries is causing unnecessary harm to my financial reputation and may impact my ability to secure favorable terms for future financial opportunities. 

I request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure that the credit reporting agencies promptly : Remove all unauthorized and unconnected inquiries from my credit report. 
Implement stricter verification processes to prevent unauthorized inquiries from being reported in the future. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a resolution that ensures compliance with the FCRA and protects my rights as a consumer.

Here are the details of my situation : 1. Address Information : I have been living at my current address for over 10 years. However, the address listed on my Equifax credit report is incorrect, and I have never been associated with the address that appears. 
2. Documentation Provided : I have submitted clear evidence to Equifax, including a photo of my drivers license and my bank statement, both of which confirm my current and correct address. 
3. Equifax Response : Despite submitting this documentation multiple times, Equifax has informed me that they are unable to verify my address change. This has caused confusion and frustration as I have no idea why they are unable to validate my address, even though Ive lived here for a decade.

2024-12-01,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Account number XXXX Subject : Formal Dispute Regarding Negative Item and Violation of Federal Laws To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute an inaccurate and unlawful negative item listed on my credit report. I believe this entry is not only incorrect but also reflects a violation of several federal consumer protection laws. Below, I outline the violations and request immediate action to investigate and rectify this matter. 

XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1635 ( Right of Rescission ) : Under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), I am entitled to specific disclosures and protections regarding financial obligations. This law provides a right to rescind certain transactions within a specific timeframe. The negative item on my report does not reflect that this right was properly honored or communicated. 


XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( Validation of Debts ) : As per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I have the right to request validation of any alleged debt. Despite my requests for verification, I have not received adequate proof that the negative item on my report is valid or accurate. This failure constitutes a violation of federal law. 


XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( Communication Practices ) : The FDCPA also regulates the manner and timing of communications regarding debt. Any communication about the disputed item must comply with the prescribed standards, including restrictions on contacting me without consent or at inappropriate times. I believe these standards have not been adhered to. 


XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( Compliance with Accurate Reporting ) : The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates that credit bureaus maintain strict procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information reported. The presence of this negative item, which I have reason to believe is inaccurate or unverifiable, indicates a failure on your part to comply with these obligations. 



Requested Resolution : XXXX. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and the removal of the disputed negative item from my credit report. 


XXXX. Please provide me with purchase agreement verifying the accuracy and legality of the information in question, as required by federal law. 


XXXX. Confirm in writing that the disputed item has been removed or corrected within 30 days of receiving this letter. 



Failure to address this matter adequately and in compliance with federal laws may result in further action, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursuing legal remedies.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious matter. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter and keep me informed of your actions regarding this dispute.

Dear PENFED Customer Service, I am writing to formally dispute some hard inquiries that were placed on my credit report by PENFED on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ; This inquiries were related to a pre-approval application for a credit card and a car loan. Since I was only seeking pre approval, I did not expect or authorize any hard inquiries to be conducted on my credit report, as this type of action is typically not required for preliminary evaluations.These hard inquiries are currently affecting my credit score, which I believe is unfair given the circumstances and can affect me for future credit application. I request that PENFED immediately remove these hard inquiries from my credit report as they were neither authorized by me in the context of a simple pre-approval nor were they necessary. 
Also I dont know if you are aware but in the pre- approval application page It clearly says that it will only be a soft pull and WILL NOT affect my score ( see document attached of the application page ) Please confirm in writing when this hard inquiry have been removed. If you require any additional information from me, feel free to contact me at cell phone number XXXX or email me at XXXX Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,PENTAGON FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,FL,33417,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10977721

2024-12-01,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Unauthorized Charge and Poor Customer Support Dear American Express Customer Service Team, I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding an unresolved issue with a charge on my account and the poor customer service I have encountered in addressing it. 
Details of the Issue : On XX/XX/2024, I noticed a charge of {$590.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  on my American Express account. This charge was completely unauthorized and unexpected. I did use this service once last year, which was a one-time purchase, but I was dissatisfied with it. I was under the impression that this was not part of a membership or subscription, especially given the absence of any contract or agreement I signed for recurring charges. 
Additional Concerns with the Merchant : This merchant has repeatedly reached out to me through banners, direct emails, and social media messages. However, when it comes to customer support, it is impossible to speak with an actual person. Despite contacting them several times through their chat feature, I made it clear that I was no longer interested in their product or service.

When I purchased their service last year, I explicitly mentioned that I did not wish to extend my use beyond one year. At that time, they even offered me a 25 % discount to accept their one-year service, which I agreed to and have documented proof of. Furthermore, I reiterated multiple times this year that I was not interested in continuing with their service, nor did I use their service even once in the past year.

This is clearly a scheme designed to trap customers into paying for a service they no longer use or want, and it is alarming that American Express is aiding this merchant in collecting unauthorized payments from its customers.

Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue : XXXX. Dispute Initiation : On XX/XX/2024, I contacted American Express to dispute this charge. Unfortunately, the representative I spoke to was unhelpful and argumentative, despite my clear explanation that this charge was unauthorized. I emphasized that I did not consent to any membership, subscription, or automatic renewal. 
XXXX. Merchant Contact Attempt : The representative insisted that I contact the merchant directly. However, the contact information provided led me to a website ( www.ssprg.com ) that is entirely unhelpful and appears to be part of a fraudulent scheme. The phone number provided also leads nowhere, making it impossible to reach the merchant. 
XXXX. Follow-Up Call : When I followed up on XX/XX/2024, another representative informed me that the charge was deemed valid, and I was expected to accept this renewal for another year. They offered to block the merchant from charging me next year but refused to reverse the current charge of {$590.00}. 
Key Concerns : This charge was unauthorized, and no valid subscription agreement exists. 
The merchant appears to be running a fraudulent scheme, making it impossible for customers to reach them for cancellations or support. 
I have made it explicitly clear to the merchant several times that I am not interested in their product or service and have not used their service this year. 
American Express is failing to protect its customers by siding with such merchants, effectively enabling these schemes. 
Broader Implications : Rejecting legitimate disputes against such predatory merchants not only erodes customer trust but also contributes to the rise of fraudulent schemes. American Express has always positioned itself as a company that prioritizes customer protection and satisfaction. Unfortunately, my recent experience does not reflect these values. 
My Expectations : XXXX. I request an immediate reversal of the {$590.00} charge on my account. 
XXXX. I ask American Express to thoroughly investigate this merchant for fraudulent practices. 
XXXX. I urge American Express to improve training for its representatives to ensure they understand the importance of protecting customers from unauthorized charges and scams. 
American Express has a long-standing reputation for excellence, which is why this experience has been particularly shocking and disappointing. I hope that you will take my complaint seriously and act promptly to resolve this matter.

2024-12-01,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I have had numerous problems accessing my online credit card account with Comenity Bank. They may be part of Bread Financial now. They issued my AAA Travel Advantage VISA Signature credit card. 

The first problem started a year ago, when my cashback rewards balance started always showing {$0.00} when I logged in. I had to call customer service to have them manually redeem the rewards for me because the website would not let me. It always showed I had {$0.00} rewards when in fact I had hundreds of dollars in rewards. 

At the same time, I had problems logging into the website. The website would show a spinning circle, and eventually time out when I tried to log in after I entered my login and password. On average, it would only work once out of 20 attempts. 

It would always show my phone number as unverified, and when I tried to verify it, it would seem to work but on the next login, it would still ask me to verify it. I was never able to use my phone number in two-factor authentication because it still thought it was unverified. 

The problems got much worse this summer. I called customer service on XX/XX/year> to have them manually redeem my rewards. I also asked them about my unverified phone issue. They said it was a "" known issue '', but they would try to fix it. Apparently they added my phone number in, but they said since my profile "" changed '', I was locked out of logging into my account for 10 days!!!! Logging into my account has not worked since then, and it is now XX/XX/year>. I have been calling them almost every week. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a "" supervisor '' said maybe deleting my online account and re-registering will fix it. She deleted my online account, and then told me I would have to wait another 10 days before re-registering. I waited, and them upon entering all the registration information, I got the error message, "" Due to a technical issue, we were unable to save your response and complete your registration. Please try again. '' I tried several times with no luck. 

Supposedly Comenity is now charging me for paper statements, which is ridiculous because I can not access the online statements. 

I tried using their Bread app, with similar poor results. I have never been able to log in to my account using the Bread app. 

I have never had a worse experience with a credit card company. They do not seem to have any Tier 2 technical or IT support. The customer service reps are friendly but are not able to fix any problems and say there is not a Tier 2 to forward my issues to. They all have strong accents and are not based in the U.S. They will not give me a trouble ticket number. Their standard answer is to try again later, or that I have to wait 10 days. They acknowledge that other customers have the same issues. Comenity needs to hire experts to fix their website. This is unacceptable and I'm not sure why I haven't gotten rid of this credit card yet, but I plan to switch to a different company as soon as possible.",,"Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.",VA,23669,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10985109

I explained that I didn't receive a code online or an email, and they didn't give me one at the branch. If an email was sent with one it is possible that it went into spam or got auto deleted, but the fact remains that I opened the account and met all the requirements. The requirements being, being a new customer opening a Wells Fargo everyday checking account, having at least {$1000.00} in direct deposit into the account within 90 days, and the account remaining open for 90 days. My account is still open to this day. I would like the XXXX XXXX that I was guaranteed for choosing them as my new bank. My first contact with them on this matter was in XXXX.

For over three years, Equifax has been reporting inaccurate information on my credit report, which has not only negatively impacted my credit score but has also limited my financial opportunities. Under 1681i, I have the right to dispute any inaccurate information, and the agency is required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation free of charge within 30 days of receiving my dispute. 

I have previously notified Equifax of this disputed information and provided supporting documentation to substantiate my claim ; however, they have failed to rectify the inaccuracies or provide a satisfactory response. Additionally, I have faxed all relevant supporting documents to the Attorney General 's office in XXXX, GA, for review. 

This ongoing issue has violated my rights to privacy and has caused significant distress. I request your assistance in investigating this matter further and holding Equifax accountable for their non-compliance with federal regulations. 

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"LVNV dispute dispute This complaint is in regard to the account related to LVNV FUNDING LLC that is being reported to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. 
LVNV FUNDING LLC needs prior consent from either the court or the consumer before communication with the collection of any debt to a credit reporting agency. 
Notice, it is a fact, I the consumer did not give prior consent to communication to the debt collector, { LVNV FUNDING LLC } and the consumer alleges there was no prior consent from a court giving permission to contact I, the consumer in collection of any debts owed to LVNV FUNDING LLC and thus this communication by LVNV FUNDING LLC is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692c ( a ) without a court order brought forth. I did not consent to LVNV FUNDING LLC communicating with me any obligations to pay a debt through any mediums which includes communication with the credit reporting agencies to report the alleged debt. Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692a ( 6 ) 1692a ( 6 ) - a debt collector is defined as anyone in the business of collecting a debt. Therefore by definition LVNV FUNDING LLC is debt collector. 

Notice, it is a fact, that, I, agent for principal ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) am aware that LVNV FUNDING LLC is a debt collector by the legal definition. Pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692 ( a ) ( 6 ), a debt collector is any person who uses instrumentality of interstate commerce, such as the mails, in any business which the principal purpose is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another Furthermore this law U.S.Code 1692d states A Debt collector may not engage in any conduct ( no restriction ) which will harass, oppress or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt. Oppressing a right would be conduct not allowed from 1692d. Credit is the right granted and protected by federal law. If any debt collection caused a denial of credit this allows for damages. I have been denied credit on multiple occasions and denied housing because of this negative account on XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. This is an actual damage as this tremendously harmed my ability to operate in commerce and purchase household goods and shelter for I the consumer and my family. 

Notice, it is a fact, I the affiant is aware, credit is a right granted to me as a creditor under the Truth in Lending Act and { LVNV FUNDING LLC } does not have the right to oppress or abuse any part of my character which would restrict or prohibit my right to extend credit. LVNV FUNDING LLC has oppressed my right to extend credit which is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692d.

Furthermore this law 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ) states the actions performed by LVNV FUNDING LLC was illegal- Communicating with any person false credit information including failure to communicate the debt is being disputed has not been verified. As well as there being no contract that exists bewteen the I the consumer and LVNV FUNDING LLC thats says I the consumer would pay LVNV FUNDING LLC the alleged debt this was false and misleading reporting.

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware and has proof in this complaint of false and inaccurate credit information reported and it is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ). LVNV FUNDING LLC reported a debt collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX report. I the affiant have disputed this debt this information can not keep reporting while the dispute is still not resolved as well as failing to communicate with the credit reporting agencies that the debt is being disputed and has not been verified by I, the consumer. This was very misleading and LVNV FUNDING LLC used this as a tactic to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting a fake debt while at the same time attempting to force me to pay the alleged debt under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting the negative collections account to my consumer report in doing so severely damaging my credit worthiness and my ability to operate in commerce and obtain household goods and shelter. I have been denied housing on multiple occasions leading to me being in a XXXX XXXX  this is an actual damage to I, the consumer. I demand once again that LVNV FUNDING LLC fix this issue by deleting the account. LVNV FUNDING LLC is also in violation of 15 U.S. code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( I ) 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) - Reported information can not be only transactions and experiences between the consumer and a company. 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ) - The consumer must be given a chance to direct the information whether they want the information about a transaction they had to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, a consumer must be given a chance to direct whether they want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding LVNV FUNDING LLC in doing so is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and this information must be removed. 

I the consumer also know that it is a fact that XXXX XXXX the original creditor assigned the debt to LVNV FUNDING LLC. The two debt collectors that reported the alleged debt and are attempting collect are LVNV FUNDING LLC and XXXX XXXX. Both debt collectors are attempting to force the consumer to pay under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting a collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. In doing so both companies have severely damaged my ability to operate in commerce and use my right to credit. I the consumer have a right to credit and have had that right taken from me due to the improper use of my consumer report from LVNV FUNDING LLC and XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ) 1692e ( 12 ) - the assignee clause which makes the 3rd party debt collector and the one who assigns the debt liable. 
XXXX XXXX assigned the debt to LVNV FUNDING LLC This means they are both liable for the alleged debt not I the consumer Notice, it is a fact, consumer has reason to be believe and do so believes, LVNV FUNDING LLC and XXXX XXXX are in violation in accordance to Article 9, the assignment of a def

aulted note is illegal. Both the assignee and the assigned are both liable for violations under 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ). So I am actually not liable for this debt according to what the law says about the matter.

The debt was assigned to LVNV FUNDING LLC they are attempting to collect a debt that they were assigned. LVNV FUNDING LLC and XXXX XXXX XXXX do not have any contract which contains my signature nor does a contract exists that states XXXX XXXX XXXX would pay LVNV FUNDING LLC any payment for a debt. 

There is no contract between the consumer and the debt collectors. This violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) which prohibits abusive, unfair, or deceptive debt collection practices ; if you are contacted by multiple collectors for the same debt. Both LVNV FUNDING LLC and XXXX XXXX have both contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX in an attempt to collect a debt. 
XXXX XXXX had no right to sell the account without notice to i the consumer before doing so. XXXX XXXX also had no right to sell the debt because XXXX XXXX already received income from I the consumer. XXXX XXXX already received full payment of the debt. XXXX XXXX withdrew funds from my Social Security trust account. US Treasury XXXX  XXXX  Trust Account - [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBER # XXXX, with IRS Form 1099-A. The IRS accounting department can properly account for the transfer of these funds from this account to all debt accounts that I am said to owe or be in default. Due to this fact I, the consumer have no further obligations to XXXX XXXX. 

LVNV FUNDING LLC also violated 15 U.S.Code 1692j 15 USC 1692 ; 1692 - False and deceptive forms. A form which is made to believe the debt has something to do with you or you are obligated and you are not, is false and deceptive.

Fraud found in a form is a false and deceptive form and a violation of this act. For example if you go and get into an agreement as a consumer credit transaction, you went for something and gave credit. Companies are known to make what's called asset accounts. I never went to have an account made, this is a false and deceptive form because they never disclose this account being made. This includes statements which falsely accuses me of owing a debt. The delivery of these forms via mail constitutes mail fraud. I also never created an account with LVNV FUNDING LLC if I the consumer did not open the account then it is fraud.

Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, there has been fraud found in this form shown in EXHIBIT ( - ). This form is therefore false and deceptive, void and a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692j I do not have a contract with LVNV FUNDING LLC.

Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) 15 USC 16324010 ) 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) - Allows for any action of damage.

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) allows civil liability rewards for any damages, which may include stress, harassment, anxiety, mental anguish, and other damages all caused by violations of FDCPA due to LVNV FUNDING LLC abusive and deceptive business practices. Which caused I the consumer to be denied for housing and certain lines of credit. Which caused I the consumer to be in a homeless shelter and and unable to operate in commerce this is very un equitable. 

Furthermore I am owed monetary value in the amount of XXXX $ for every single violation of the UNITED STATES CODES. 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - 1000 dollars for each proceeding.

Notice, it is a fact, 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) states an individual action is a violation worth 1000 dollars for proceeding, however understand 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) these violations has caused actual damage By LVNV FUNDING LLC violating 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and not giving me a chance to direct whether I want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding LVNV FUNDING LLC in doing so LVNV FUNDING LLC is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) I was damaged by this violation of the law LVNV FUNDING LLC took it upon themselves to infringe on my right to direct the information I want reported regarding the transaction. Then hindering my ability to credit by reporting without my directions a collections account that negatively impacted my consumer report. 
Every violation of the law by LVNV FUNDING LLC caused a damage to I, the consumer. 

LVNV FUNDING LLC also committed identity theft. They obtained my identifying information such as my social security number to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting the fraudulent account. This use of my social security number was not authorized by I the consumer. 15 U.S.Code 1644 ( a ) 15 USC 1644 ( a ) 1644 ( a ) - Fraudulent authorized use of a credit card such as a license plate, social security card, EBT card etc, can result up to a XXXX fine.

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, the fraudulent use of a credit card, by LVNV FUNDING LLC is defined as whoever uses, attempts or conspires to use a card to obtain money, goods or services shall be fined for {$10000.00} or imprisoned for 10 years or both.

LVNV FUNDING LLC used my social security account number the exact number on social security card to report information to my consumer report and to collect on a debt.

This is a direct violation of 1644 ( a ) Also note that this matter could become even more serious if this issues isnt resolved because according to 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) -If i win a civil suit and file a class action, i can obtain up to XXXX $ or 1 % of the company. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, If judgement is made against { LVNV FUNDING LLC } I, the affiant, can and will pursue class action for the amount of XXXX $ to 1 % of your company in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) meaning I could own a percentage of LVNV FUNDING LLC or receive XXXX $ for LVNV FUNDING LLC inconveniences to I the consumer. 

15 U.S.Code 1602 ( b ) 15 USC 1602 ( b ) 1602 ( b ) Bureau.

The term Bureau means the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Consumer Reporting Agencies are not credit bureaus. The CFPB regulates the credit reporting agencies.

I urge the CFPB to work swiftly and diligently with me on this matter to make sure LVNV FUNDING LLC and the credit reporting agencies XXXX and XXXX resolves this issue in a timely fair and equitable way for I, the consumer. As well as make sure they follow the laws that were set in place to govern them.

2024-12-01,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Account number XXXX Subject : Formal Dispute Regarding Negative Item and Violation of Federal Laws To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute an inaccurate and unlawful negative item listed on my credit report. I believe this entry is not only incorrect but also reflects a violation of several federal consumer protection laws. Below, I outline the violations and request immediate action to investigate and rectify this matter. I would like a purchase agreement.

1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1635 ( Right of Rescission ) : Under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), I am entitled to specific disclosures and protections regarding financial obligations. This law provides a right to rescind certain transactions within a specific timeframe. The negative item on my report does not reflect that this right was properly honored or communicated.

2. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( Validation of Debts ) : As per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I have the right to request validation of any alleged debt. Despite my requests for verification, I have not received adequate proof that the negative item on my report is valid or accurate. This failure constitutes a violation of federal law. 


XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( Communication Practices ) : The FDCPA also regulates the manner and timing of communications regarding debt. Any communication about the disputed item must comply with the prescribed standards, including restrictions on contacting me without consent or at inappropriate times. I believe these standards have not been adhered to.

4. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( Compliance with Accurate Reporting ) : The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates that credit bureaus maintain strict procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information reported. The presence of this negative item, which I have reason to believe is inaccurate or unverifiable, indicates a failure on your part to comply with these obligations.

Requested Resolution : 1. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and the removal of the disputed negative item from my credit report.

2. Please provide me with purchase agreement verifying the accuracy and legality of the information in question, as required by federal law.

3. Confirm in writing that the disputed item has been removed or corrected within 30 days of receiving this letter.

Failure to address this matter adequately and in compliance with federal laws may result in further action, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursuing legal remedies.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious matter. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter and keep me informed of your actions regarding this dispute.

They did not notify me in advance that my account was in any danger. I was attempting to make a purchase under the assumption I had about {$1300.00} in credit available ( due to the payment only partially posting ) only to embarrassingly and furiously discover that I do not. Now my credit score takes a hit for no VALID reason other than Synchrony wants to play dirty games. When a company randomly decides to DRASTICALLY lower credit or close accounts, the usage portion of your credit score increases because it looks like youre using more credit than you are. This is a DANGEROUS THREAT to a a persons financial stability and growth.

Synchrony falsely cited my credit worthiness as an excuse even though I paid them ON TIME every month since opening the account in 2021 with the exception of two months last year when I lost my income due to an unplanned medical leave. The fact that they reduced my credit without warning AFTER I paid them {$3500.00} in full is THEFT and I want my money back. I have gone through similar things with XXXX and XXXX XXXX.

The case was handled by the XXXX XXXX XXXX under case # XXXX. As a result, my car was totaled, and the responsible party 's insurance, XXXX XXXX represented by XXXX XXXX, assured me they would pay off the loan for the car. However, later I discovered that the insurance company did not settle the entire outstanding debt, which came as a surprise to me. 

In addition, I promptly purchased a replacement car from the same dealership, with the same lender and make of car. I usually make my monthly car payments through the Kia Finance app. In XXXX, when I went to make a payment for the new car, I noticed that the old account ( ending with XXXX ) had been closed with a balance of {$0.00}. I continued making regular monthly payments for the new car. 

The lender claims they tried to contact me in XXXX to settle the remaining amount left unpaid by the insurance company. However, I never received any communication from them. I use a XXXX mailbox, which can sometimes lead to mixed-up correspondence. At this point, the amount for the old account was still showing as {$0.00} on my app, and I was still consistently paying for the new car. 

Due to the unpaid amount, the lender reported the account as a charge-off to the credit bureaus, negatively impacting my credit score. In XXXX, both the dealership and XXXX XXXX informed me about this issue. I then checked my credit score and saw that it had dropped from XXXX to XXXX. The dealership provided the necessary information to my GAP insurance, and in XXXX, the insurance sent a check to clear the remaining balance. The amount was paid off with the GAP insurance I had purchased when buying the car. 

The problem is that the charge-off is still showing on my credit report, continuing to have a negative effect on my credit score. This negative mark will stay on my report for 10 years.

My investment business heavily relies on my credit score, and this issue has impacted my ability to borrow money. If not resolved, it will continue to affect my business for the next 10 years. I am currently in the process of asking the lender, Kia Motor Finance, to remove the charge-off from my credit report. Despite my efforts, they are unwilling to do so.

2024-12-01,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Account number XXXX Subject : Formal Dispute Regarding Negative Item and Violation of Federal Laws To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute an inaccurate and unlawful negative item listed on my credit report. I believe this entry is not only incorrect but also reflects a violation of several federal consumer protection laws. Below, I outline the violations and request immediate action to investigate and rectify this matter. 

XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1635 ( Right of Rescission ) : Under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), I am entitled to specific disclosures and protections regarding financial obligations. This law provides a right to rescind certain transactions within a specific timeframe. The negative item on my report does not reflect that this right was properly honored or communicated. 


XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( Validation of Debts ) : As per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I have the right to request validation of any alleged debt. Despite my requests for verification, I have not received adequate proof that the negative item on my report is valid or accurate. This failure constitutes a violation of federal law. 


XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( Communication Practices ) : The FDCPA also regulates the manner and timing of communications regarding debt. Any communication about the disputed item must comply with the prescribed standards, including restrictions on contacting me without consent or at inappropriate times. I believe these standards have not been adhered to. 


XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( Compliance with Accurate Reporting ) : The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates that credit bureaus maintain strict procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information reported. The presence of this negative item, which I have reason to believe is inaccurate or unverifiable, indicates a failure on your part to comply with these obligations. 



Requested Resolution : XXXX. I demand an immediate investigation into this matter and the removal of the disputed negative item from my credit report. 


XXXX. Please provide me with purchase agreement verifying the accuracy and legality of the information in question, as required by federal law. 


XXXX. Confirm in writing that the disputed item has been removed or corrected within 30 days of receiving this letter. 



Failure to address this matter adequately and in compliance with federal laws may result in further action, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursuing legal remedies.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious matter. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter and keep me informed of your actions regarding this matter.

As I understand Costco 's return policy, customers are allowed to return items at any time if they are not satisfied, which is what I was hoping to do in this case. However, when I mentioned this to the manager, I was met with a very rude response. I was accused of attempting to abuse the return policy, which I found both offensive and completely unwarranted.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am filing this formal complaint against Chase Bank, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX for the following violations : Fraudulent Reporting of Charge-Offs as Debt ( IRS Classification XXXX Income ). 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Ignoring My Letters and Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ). 
Failure to Disclose Securitization of Promissory Notes.

Non-Compliance with Audit Reporting and GAAP Standards.

Fraudulent Reporting of Charge-Offs as Debt The reporting of charge-offs on my credit report is fraudulent and misleading. According to IRS regulations, charge-offs are classified as income on a 1099-C form when reported to the IRS. Per federal law, income can not be reported as debt on a consumer credit report.

Violation : Reporting charge-offs as debt breaches the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, which prohibits the reporting of inaccurate information. 

Demand : Chase Bank and XXXX XXXX must immediately remove all charge-offs from my credit report as these entries are misleading and harmful to my financial reputation. 
2. Breach of Fiduciary Duty : Ignoring My Letters and Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ) I have sent multiple letters asserting my rights, including a Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ), which has been ignored by both Chase Bank and XXXX XXXX. By failing to respond, these entities have violated their fiduciary obligations and undermined my rights to assert my interest in the credit. 

Legal Precedent : XXXX XXXX XXXX establishes that promissory notes fully fund credit, rendering the consumer the true creditor. As the creditor, I retain rights and interests in the credit and demand acknowledgment of the same. 
Demand : Chase Bank and XXXX XXXX must immediately recognize my rights as the creditor and provide a detailed response to all letters and XXXX documents sent. 

XXXX. Failure to Disclose Securitization of Promissory Notes It has come to my attention that the promissory notes I provided to Chase Bank and XXXX XXXX were securitized and sold without my knowledge or consent. This failure to disclose constitutes fraud and unjust enrichment. 

Violation : Under 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( Truth in Lending Act - TILA ), lenders are required to disclose the sale, assignment, or transfer of debt instruments to third parties. 

Fraudulent Omission : By securitizing my promissory notes and profiting from the proceeds, without compensating me as the original creditor, Chase Bank and XXXX XXXX have committed fraud. 
Demand : Provide full disclosure of the securitization of my promissory notes, including an accounting of proceeds and confirmation that these proceeds have been applied to offset any alleged debt. 

4. Non-Compliance with Audit Reporting and GAAP Standards Under federal law and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), financial institutions are required to provide accurate audit reports and account reconciliations.

Legal Obligation : 12 U.S.C. 1831n ( a ) mandates compliance with GAAP standards for all financial institutions.

15 U.S.C. 1637 ( TILA ) requires creditors to provide clear and accurate account information. 
Violation : Chase Bank and XXXX XXXX have failed to provide audit reports and reconcile accounts as requested. Their lack of transparency further suggests that the reporting of charge-offs is fraudulent and unsupported by proper accounting practices. 


Formal Opt-Out of Authorization and Illegality of Reporting Transaction History Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am formally opting out of any and all authorizations I may have givenwhether written, unwritten, verbal, or non-verbalunder 15 U.S.C. 6802. As a consumer, I have the unequivocal right to opt out of the sharing and use of my non-public personal information ( NPI ) at any time.

By exercising this opt-out right : Unauthorized Reporting is Illegal : Under 15 U.S.C. 6801, it is illegal for financial institutions to report or share my transaction history without my explicit consent.

The policy of Congress explicitly mandates that every financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to protect the security, confidentiality, and privacy of its customers ' NPI.

2024-12-01,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"I am filing a complaint regarding an issue with a loan I co-signed for my mother. I co-signed this loan in good faith, but I was never notified by the bank about missed payments, and I encountered significant difficulty in getting assistance to resolve the issue. As a result, the late payments were reported to my credit report, despite my efforts to address the matter. 

As the co-signer, I was not alerted by the bank when payments were missed. I was unaware of the late status of the loan until it was reflected on my credit report. Given my responsibility as a co-signer, this lack of communication left me in a difficult position. 

I never had an online account set up to make payments. Despite my efforts to resolve this issue, I could not get any help from the bank in setting up an online account or finding an alternative way to make payments. On multiple occasions, I called the bank to ask for assistance, but I was often hung up on. When I visited a branch in person, I was told that I could not get help, and despite being promised call backs, I never received any follow-up communication. 

I made payments on the following dates : XX/XX/year> XX/XX/year> Despite making these payments, the late payment entries still appear on my credit report. I believe the lack of communication and the failure to provide adequate customer service contributed to the delays in payment. 

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this issue and assist in having the late payment entries reviewed and corrected. The lack of notification, difficulty in getting information, and poor customer service resulted in unnecessary harm to my credit, and I would like this matter resolved.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Fraudulent Reporting of Charge-Offs as Debt The reporting of charge-offs on my credit report is fraudulent and misleading. According to IRS regulations, charge-offs are classified as income on a 1099-C form when reported to the IRS. Per federal law, income can not be reported as debt on a consumer credit report.

Violation : Reporting charge-offs as debt breaches the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, which prohibits the reporting of inaccurate information.

Breach of Fiduciary Duty : Ignoring My Letters and Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ) I have sent multiple letters asserting my rights, including a Durable Power of Attorney ( DPOA ), which has been ignored by upgrade and Victoria secret By failing to respond, these entities have violated their fiduciary obligations and undermined my rights to assert my interest in the credit.

Legal Precedent : Grimes v. White establishes that promissory notes fully fund credit, rendering the consumer the true creditor. As the creditor, I retain rights and interests in the credit and demand acknowledgment of the same.

3. Failure to Disclose Securitization of Promissory Notes It has come to my attention that the promissory notes I provided to Upgrade and Victoria Secret were securitized and sold without my knowledge or consent. This failure to disclose constitutes fraud and unjust enrichment.

Violation : Under 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( Truth in Lending Act - TILA ), lenders are required to disclose the sale, assignment, or transfer of debt instruments to third parties.

Fraudulent Omission : By securitizing my promissory notes and profiting from the proceeds, without compensating me as the original creditor, XXXX and Victoria Secret have committed fraud. 


4. Non-Compliance with Audit Reporting and GAAP Standards Under federal law and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), financial institutions are required to provide accurate audit reports and account reconciliations.

Legal Obligation : 12 U.S.C. 1831n ( a ) mandates compliance with GAAP standards for all financial institutions.

15 U.S.C. 1637 ( TILA ) requires creditors to provide clear and accurate account information. 
Violation : XXXX and Victoria Secret have failed to provide audit reports and reconcile accounts as requested. Their lack of transparency further suggests that the reporting of charge-offs is fraudulent and unsupported by proper accounting practices.",,"Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.",FL,32836,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10984894

As a national reporting agency, you are governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( "" FCRA '' ), which protects consumers from inaccurate, outdated, or invalidated information reporting of their credit file. The FCRA states that it's the Credit Bureau 's responsibility to ensure that all information contained within consumer credit files is accurate and free from errors.

According to federal law, you are required to comply with the requirements imposed under the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., including but not limited to : follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information in the consumer report, as required by 15 U.S.C. $ 1681e ( b ) ; 2 ) comply with the investigation requirements ; 3 ) should not provide consumer credit file to companies without determining that these companies had a permissible purpose to obtain consumer credit file pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ; 4 ) provide consumer credit file pursuant to 15 U.S.C. $ 1681g ; 5 ) et seq.

Accordingly, I request your company to provide verifiable documentary proof ( e.g., original consumer contract or similar proof bearing my wet ink signature on it ) you have on file of accounts/items listed below. Under the FCRA, if you do not provide documented and verifiable proof, you must remove all unverified, invalid, derogatory information from my consumer disclosure report. For your convenience, I am sending you a list of the items you need to verify them. These listed accounts are neither my debts nor my authorized inquiries.

I never received a XXXX from XXXX XXXX for the charge off that they claimed on my personal credit report which is still showing today XX/XX/XXXX as a charge off on my personal credit report which is impacting my overall FICO score as a result of the incorrect reporting. 

I made an agreement with XXXX XXXX  to pay an agreed upon balance they claimed was still owed on the vehicle although they received a tax credit from the IRS for the written off balance owed on the vehicle. The reason why I made the agreement was because XXXX XXXX continued to threaten collections and repossession of the vehicle until the balance they claim was owed was paid on the vehicle. Therefore I am requesting a 1099c from XXXX XXXX which they were supposed to have provided to me once the account was charged off. 

I paid the agreed upon amount they requested and still had to wait over 4 months from XXXX XXXX to release the title to my vehicle.

Since I was only seeking pre approval, I did not expect or authorize any hard inquiries to be conducted on my credit report, as this type of action is typically not required for preliminary evaluations.These hard inquiries are currently affecting my credit score, which I believe is unfair given the circumstances and can affect me for future credit application. I request that XXXX immediately remove these hard inquiries from my credit report as they were neither authorized by me in the context of a simple pre-approval nor were they necessary. 
Also I dont know if you are aware but in the pre- approval application page It clearly says that it will only be a soft pull and WILL NOT affect my score ( see document attached of the application page ) Please confirm in writing when this hard inquiry have been removed.

2024-12-01,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Credit denial,"Subject : Security Fraud and Non-Compliance with Federal Laws by GM Financial Regarding XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, Tender of Payment, and Power of Attorney To Whom It XXXX Concern : I hereby submit a formal complaint against GM Financial for their egregious violations of federal law concerning the mishandling of my application, tender of payment, and Power of Attorney for a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX valued at {$130000.00}. The following outlines the violations and unlawful actions committed by GM Financial, supported by federal statutes and pertinent case law. 

Background On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a formal application to GM Financial for the purchase of a XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX. Along with my application, I included : XXXX. XXXX of XXXX : An endorsed payment instrument intended to satisfy the purchase amount, accompanied by explicit instructions that if GM Financial chose not to accept my application and tender, they were to return the original documents to me promptly. 


XXXX. Power of Attorney : A legally executed document authorizing my agent to act on my behalf concerning this transaction. 



A certified mail receipt confirms that GM Financial received these documents on XX/XX/year>. To date, GM Financial has neither processed nor returned my application, tender of payment, or acknowledged the XXXX of Attorney, as required under federal and commercial law. 

Violations XXXX. Failure to Comply with the Uniform Commercial Code ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX : Tender of Payment : This provision states that if a tender of payment is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, the obligation is XXXX to the extent of the amount of the tender. GM Financial 's refusal to process or return the tendered payment violates this provision, effectively discharging my obligation. 

XXXX XXXX : Claims to an XXXX : This section indicates that a person taking an instrument is subject to claims of property or possessory rights in the instrument. By retaining my tender without acceptance, GM Financial is unlawfully holding my property, infringing upon my rights. 



XXXX. XXXX XXXX By retaining possession of my tendered payment and application without processing them, GM Financial has engaged in deceptive practices, constituting security fraud. This deliberate act of withholding my legally valid tender of payment without action is a breach of fiduciary duty and trust. 


XXXX. Violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX. XXXX et seq. : The XXXX mandates that creditors provide applicants with a timely notice of action taken on their credit applications. GM Financial 's failure to respond to my application violates this requirement. 

Regulation B ( XXXX C.F.R. XXXX ) : This regulation requires creditors to notify applicants of action taken within 30 days of receiving a completed application. GM Financial 's non-response exceeds this timeframe, constituting a direct violation. 

Case Law Support : In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the court held that failing to provide notice of adverse action violates the XXXX. GM Financial 's inaction mirrors the non-compliance addressed in this case. 



XXXX. Failure to Acknowledge Power of Attorney The Power of Attorney I provided grants my agent the authority to act on my behalf in this transaction. GM Financial 's failure to acknowledge this document impedes the agent 's ability to perform duties lawfully assigned, violating principles of agency law and disregarding the legal standing of the XXXX of Attorney. 



Supporting Evidence Certified Mail Receipt : Proof that GM Financial received my application, tender of payment, and Power of Attorney on XX/XX/year>. 

Endorsement Letter : Document containing explicit instructions to either process or return the application and tender. 

Power of Attorney : Legally executed document authorizing my agent to act on my behalf in this transaction. 


Conclusion GM Financial 's refusal to process or return my application and tender of payment, along with their failure to acknowledge the Power of Attorney, constitutes clear violations of the Uniform Commercial Code, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and established case law. Their actions amount to security fraud and a breach of fiduciary duty owed to me as the applicant. 

This complaint serves as a formal notice of their unlawful conduct.

2024-12-01,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Formal Complaint Regarding Fraudulent Account, FCRA Violations, and Unauthorized Legal Actions by Discover Bank To Whom It May Concern at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Discover Bank concerning a fraudulent account opened in my name, improper reporting practices, violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), and unauthorized legal actions taken against me. 

Background and Timeline of Events : 1. Initial Identity Theft Incident ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : - While attempting to purchase a vehicle, I noticed a significant drop in my credit score. 
- Upon reviewing my credit reports, I discovered several unauthorized accounts opened without my knowledge or consent. 
- I promptly filed an identity theft report with the XXXX Police Department ( Report Number : XXXX ) and submitted a detailed complaint to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 

2. Implementation of Fraud Alerts ( XXXX ) : - To protect my credit, I requested and successfully placed a 7-year fraud alert with all three major credit bureaus : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 
- These alerts were intended to prevent any new unauthorized accounts from being opened in my name without stringent verification processes. 

3. Unauthorized Discover Bank Account ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : - Despite the active fraud alerts, a fraudulent account was opened with Discover Bank under my name, accruing unauthorized charges totaling {$7400.00}. 
- Discover Banks records indicate acknowledgment of this account being fraudulent, yet no effective measures were taken to resolve the issue on their end. 

4. Improper Charge-Off Reporting : - My Experian credit report shows that Discover Bank charged off the fraudulent account. 
- According to IRS guidelines, a creditor who charges off a debt is required to issue a Form 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) to the debtor. I have never received such a form from Discover Bank. 
- Furthermore, Discover Bank continues to report this charged-off account negatively on my credit reports, which is adversely affecting my credit score and financial reputation. 

5. Unauthorized Collection and Legal Actions : - Contrary to the acknowledgment of the fraudulent nature of the account, Discover Bank initiated collection efforts against me. 
- A lawsuit was filed in an attempt to collect the alleged debt, resulting in a default judgment due to my unawareness of the legal proceedings. 
- These actions have caused significant stress, financial strain, and have unjustly held me responsible for a debt I did not incur. 

Violations Noted : - Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violations : - Failure to accurately report information and correct known errors in my credit file. 
- Continued reporting of a fraudulent account despite evidence and acknowledgment of identity theft. 
- Negligence in conducting a reasonable investigation upon notification of the dispute. 

- IRS Reporting Violations : - Failure to issue a Form 1099-C upon charging off the alleged debt, as required by IRS regulations XXXX 

Impact on Me : - Financial Hardship : - Denial of credit opportunities and higher interest rates due to damaged credit. 
- Unwarranted legal fees and costs associated with defending myself against the wrongful lawsuit. 

- Emotional Distress : - Significant stress and XXXX  resulting from continuous collection attempts and legal actions for a debt I did not incur. 

- Reputational Damage : - Harm to my credit reputation, which affects both personal and professional opportunities. 

Steps I Have Taken to Resolve the Issue : - Provided copies of the police report and FTC identity theft report to Discover Bank. 
- Notified Discover Bank of the fraud alerts placed on my credit files. 
- Disputed the fraudulent account with all three credit bureaus, attaching all supporting documentation. 
- Attempted to communicate with Discover Bank 's fraud department to resolve the issue amicably. 


Conclusion : The actions of Discover Bank have caused undue hardship and are in direct violation of federal laws designed to protect consumers. I kindly request the CFPB 's assistance in resolving this matter promptly to prevent further damage to my financial well-being. 

Attachments : - Copy of the XXXX Police Department Identity Theft Report. 
- FTC Identity Theft Affidavit. 
- Correspondence with Discover Bank acknowledging the fraudulent account. 
- Copies of credit reports showing the erroneous entries and charge-off. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am available to provide any additional information or documentation required to facilitate this investigation.

He also said that I filed a partial claim which was included. That is a completely separate loan with HUD so there should not be any costs from my mortgage.

But they are trying to claim from mid XXXX to beginning of XXXX of XXXX they did over XXXX in maintenance and repairs but still have not provided me with a shred of proof. They claim they have entered my house but its on a key code. Every time I ask for the work orders they tell me they will have to get with the vendor to get them. Well how can you even bill me if you have not received work orders from your vendor. Ive ask for photo proof and they say they dont have that but claim the work was done. Ive had my buyer, contractors, inspectors in the house the entire month of XXXX and no one has been there nor done any repairs. The mortgage company has also without my consent pulled another payoff after the one that was pulled and valid thru the end of XXXX for my buyer. All of this has delayed the selling of the home and paying off the loan and mortgage flat out said to me that they will not negotiate on these fees however once I payoff the loan and they determine funds should be refunded they will do that.

The ATM machine started rolling. I noticed there was some soda residue on the drawer of the ATM. As the machine was rolling it made some rolling noise in the drawer of the ATM and then the drawer opened about a quarter of inch and shut immediately without dispensing any money. The screen on the ATM machine showed an error message. My mother who was sitting in the passenger seat of car witnessed it. Immediately after the error started another transaction and requested {$100.00} withdrawal to ensure that the {$1400.00} didn't get stuck in the drawer. The {$100.00} transaction was successful and the drawer opened and dispensed only {$100.00} as requested in the second transaction. It never dispensed the {$1400.00}. So I held my car at the ATM and asked my mother to go in the branch and ask an associate to help while I waited at the ATM. My mother went in the branch but was told that the Citibank employees at the branch can not help us instead we must call customer service. So I had to move my car out of the ATM driXXXX thru as other people were waiting behind me. I went inside the Citibank brach and ask them to call the customer service for me. The customer service started a dispute. After couple months Citibank rejected my dispute- they said their system does not show any discrepancy and will not give me my {$1400.00} back. I asked them to provide me the details and camera footage but they did not provide. I have appealed twice since then but rejected again and again.

This prolonged inaction is unacceptable, especially given that I have provided all necessary documentation and have attempted to access my account multiple times to resolve these inaccuracies.

This obstruction has prevented me from monitoring my credit report, disputing inaccuracies, or ensuring compliance with federal law. XXXX conduct represents a systematic failure to uphold its responsibilities to consumers. 

Desired Resolution : Immediate Update of My Credit Report : Reflecting all changes, including the removal of collections as previously requested by creditors. 
Restoration of Account Access : Allowing me full and unrestricted access to my Equifax account. 
Compliance Certification : A written statement confirming XXXX adherence to FCRA requirements, including timely updates to credit reports and transparency in dispute resolution. 
Legal Notice : If Equifax fails to resolve these issues within the XXXX XXXX period, I will escalate this matter by filing an Affidavit of Truth and initiating litigation for damages caused by their gross negligence.

2024-12-01,Credit card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I ordered shoes from Nordstrom using my Nordstrom card that were fraudulently described in the online listing as leather on XX/XX/XXXX. The return was for two items. I contacted them to facilitate a return immediately. I was instructed to leave the package on my doorstep and it would be collected by XXXX  the following Friday. I called the store again when I did not see official instructions in my email and asked for clarification. I did not pay the credit card bill as I assumed this would be resolved within the payment cycle, and since I don't have a Nordstrom location local anymore I don't regularly use the card. I was told not to worry as the pickup service will provide the label. The rep actually laughed at me for being overly concerned about the process as they assured me that it was handled. The pickup did not happen as I discovered the package mixed in with other boxes in XXXX with a handwritten note on the package that stated, "" Need shipping label. '' My husband had mistaken the return for a delivery and carried the package in. I immediately contacted XXXX and explained the situation. I had to tell my story multiple times before I was transferred to card services. I was instructed to leave the package again and a label would be provided. I insisted on printing the label and they agreed to send it to me. On XX/XX/XXXX, my return was processed and I was issued store credit for the purchase amount less {$20.00} for providing the label, which they did not do. I called and I spoke with XXXX and XXXX, at which time it was explained that because of their mistake in handling the return that the merchandise was technically outside of the return window, and they would manually correct it. I was told that store credit gift card would be drained and I would see the correction on my next bill. they apologized. I had another transaction for XXXX that I paid that day through my bank to bring my account to {$0.00}. I do not use online account management for this account as I don't use it often enough to set that up, but I was told not to worry about checking the status as it was already taken care of. The rep provided a phone number to follow up begrudgingly. This conversation took nearly XXXX hours. I received a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX. I responded by email and I have records from several customer service reps confirming that the refund was being processed, asking me allow a few days. 
I received no other communication until XXXX, when I answered a call from a toll free number. I was told they were "" collecting a debt. '' During this conversation, I learned that all the apologies and promises were not processed and no one followed up with me. I was transferred to another rep where the matter was to be reopened. I spent another XXXX hours on the phone after explaining to the debt collector this merchandise was sold to me under fraudulent terms, that I was incorrectly advised on how to return the merchandise, and I was assured that my account would be processed with a return. The rep promised to revisit the matter and let me know if there were any issues. She could read the account history and she verified the facts and assured me that this would be resolved. I noted that given the decision of Nordstrom not to handle the return as promised, I had also not been issued a new merchandise credit and I reminded her that I printed the label. I did not hear back. I called to follow up when I received no response and learned that matter still had not been resolved. I spoke to XXXX and she suggested filing a dispute. I have communication from XX/XX/XXXX informing that they will not issue a credit following a review of the case. I have documentation of the transactions that includes a store credit issued on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount less the cost of label printing they did not do.

Your actions not only demonstrate a complete disregard for the truth but also amount to defamation of my character by falsely accusing me of maintaining possession of a vehicle that is no longer in my control.

Your claim that multiple documents, including one bearing my wet signature, were attached to your response is patently false. Upon review, the only document attached was a statement dated XX/XX/year>, which neither contains my signature nor substantiates any of your claims. This misrepresentation to a federal agency is unacceptable, unethical, and likely illegal. 

Additionally, your assertion that I currently have possession of the vehicle is a deliberate lie. As I have already informed your company, the vehicle was inoperable and towed away by your organization. I even spoke with your representative, XXXX, to discuss the condition of the vehicle. During that conversation, I clearly explained that the car was not functional and that the dealership had sold me a defective vehiclea temporary life vehicle that broke down beyond repair. Despite this, XXXX chose only to focus on pushing a payment plan rather than addressing the issue of the vehicles condition or ownership.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC dispute This complaint is in regard to the account related to TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC that is being reported to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. 
TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC needs prior consent from either the court or the consumer before communication with the collection of any debt to a credit reporting agency. 
Notice, it is a fact, I the consumer did not give prior consent to communication to the debt collector, { TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC } and the consumer alleges there was no prior consent from a court giving permission to contact I, the consumer in collection of any debts owed to TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC and thus this communication by TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692c ( a ) without a court order brought forth. I did not consent to TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC communicating with me any obligations to pay a debt through any mediums which includes communication with the credit reporting agencies to report the alleged debt. Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692a ( 6 ) 1692a ( 6 ) - a debt collector is defined as anyone in the business of collecting a debt. Therefore by definition TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC is debt collector. 

Notice, it is a fact, that, I, agent for principal ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) am aware that TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC is a debt collector by the legal definition. Pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692 ( a ) ( 6 ), a debt collector is any person who uses instrumentality of interstate commerce, such as the mails, in any business which the principal purpose is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another Furthermore this law U.S.Code 1692d states A Debt collector may not engage in any conduct ( no restriction ) which will harass, oppress or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt. Oppressing a right would be conduct not allowed from 1692d. Credit is the right granted and protected by federal law. If any debt collection caused a denial of credit this allows for damages. I have been denied credit on multiple occasions and denied housing because of this negative account on XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. This is an actual damage as this tremendously harmed my ability to operate in commerce and purchase household goods and shelter for I the consumer and my family. 

Notice, it is a fact, I the affiant is aware, credit is a right granted to me as a creditor under the Truth in Lending Act and { XXXX XXXX TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC } does not have the right to oppress or abuse any part of my character which would restrict or prohibit my right to extend credit. TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC has oppressed my right to extend credit which is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692d.

Furthermore this law 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ) states the actions performed by TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC was illegal- Communicating with any person false credit information including failure to communicate the debt is being disputed has not been verified. As well as there being no contract that exists bewteen the I the consumer and TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC thats says I the consumer would pay TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC the alleged debt this was false and misleading reporting. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware and has proof in this complaint of false and inaccurate credit information reported and it is a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 8 ). TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC reported a debt collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. I the affiant have disputed this debt this information can not keep reporting while the dispute is still not resolved as well as failing to communicate with the credit reporting agencies that the debt is being disputed and has not been verified by I, the consumer. This was very misleading and TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC used this as a tactic to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting a fake debt while at the same time attempting to force me to pay the alleged debt under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting the negative collections account to my consumer report in doing so severely damaging my credit worthiness and my ability to operate in commerce and obtain household goods and shelter. I have been denied housing on multiple occasions leading to me being in a homeless shelter this is an actual damage to I, the consumer. I demand once again that TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC fix this issue by deleting the account. TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC is also in violation of 15 U.S. code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( I ) 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) - Reported information can not be only transactions and experiences between the consumer and a company. 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ) - The consumer must be given a chance to direct the information whether they want the information about a transaction they had to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, a consumer must be given a chance to direct whether they want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC in doing so is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and this information must be removed. 

I the consumer also know that it is a fact that XXXX XXXX XXXX the original creditor assigned the debt to TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC . The two debt collectors that reported the alleged debt and are attempting collect are TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Both debt collectors are attempting to force the consumer to pay under the threat of duress and coercion by reporting a collections account to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report. In doing so both companies have severely damaged my ability to operate in commerce and use my right to credit. I the consumer have a right to credit and have had that right taken from me due to the improper use of my consumer report from TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ) 1692e ( 12 ) - the assignee clause which makes the 3rd party debt collector and the one who assigns the debt liable. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX assigned the debt to TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC This means they are both liable for the alleged debt not I the consumer Notice, it is a fact, consumer has reason to be believe and do so believes, TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC and XXXX XXXX XXXX are in violation in accordance to Article 9, the assignment of a defaulted note is illegal. Both the assignee and the assigned are both liable for violations under 15 U.S.Code 1692e ( 12 ). So I am actually not liable for this debt according to what the law says about the matter. 

The debt was assigned to TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC they are attempting to collect a debt that they were assigned. TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC and XXXX XXXX XXXX do not have any contract which contains my signature nor does a contract exists that states XXXX XXXX XXXX would pay TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC any payment for a debt. 
There is no contract between the consumer and the debt collectors. This violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) which prohibits abusive, unfair, or deceptive debt collection practices ; if you are contacted by multiple collectors for the same debt. Both TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC and XXXX XXXX XXXX have both contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX in an attempt to collect a debt. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX had no right to sell the account without notice to i the consumer before doing so. XXXX XXXX XXXX also has no right to sell the debt because XXXX XXXX XXXX already received income from I the consumer. XXXX XXXX XXXX already received full payment of the debt. XXXX XXXX XXXX withdrew funds from my Social Security trust account. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Trust Account - [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBER # XXXX, with IRS Form XXXX. The IRS accounting department can properly account for the transfer of these funds from this account to all debt accounts that I am said to owe or be in default. I also gave XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX interest when I signed the retail installment agreement. Due to this fact I, the consumer have no further obligations to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is no longer reporting any accounts to XXXX XXXX XXXX consumer report TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC also violated 15 U.S.Code 1692j 15 USC 1692 ; 1692 - False and deceptive forms. A form which is made to believe the debt has something to do with you or you are obligated and you are not, is false and deceptive.

Fraud found in a form is a false and deceptive form and a violation of this act. For example if you go and get into an agreement as a consumer credit transaction, you went for something and gave credit. Companies are known to make what's called asset accounts. I never went to have an account made, this is a false and deceptive form because they never disclose this account being made. This includes statements which falsely accuses me of owing a debt. The delivery of these forms via mail constitutes mail fraud. I also never created an account with TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC if I the consumer did not open the account then it is fraud. 

Notice, it is a fact, consumer is aware, there has been fraud found in this form shown in EXHIBIT ( - ). This form is therefore false and deceptive, void and a violation of 15 U.S.Code 1692j I do not have a contract with TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC.

Furthermore 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) 15 USC 16324010 ) 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) - Allows for any action of damage.

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) allows civil liability rewards for any damages, which may include stress, harassment, anxiety, mental anguish, and other damages all caused by violations of FDCPA due to TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC abusive and deceptive business practices. Which caused I the consumer to be denied for housing and certain lines of credit. Which caused I the consumer to be in a homeless shelter and and unable to operate in commerce this is very un equitable.

Furthermore I am owed monetary value in the amount of 1,000 $ for every single violation of the UNITED STATES CODES. 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - 1000 dollars for each proceeding.

Notice, it is a fact, 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) states an individual action is a violation worth 1000 dollars for proceeding, however understand 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 1 ) these violations has caused actual damage By TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC violating 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) and not giving me a chance to direct whether I want the information about a transaction to be reported or not. This is referenced in the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Affiant was not given the chance to opt-out of having this information reported regarding TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC in doing so TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681 a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( ii ) I was damaged by this violation of the law TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC took it upon themselves to infringe on my right to direct the information I want reported regarding the transaction. Then hindering my ability to credit by reporting without my directions a collections account that negatively impacted my consumer report.

Every violation of the law by TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC caused a damage to I, the consumer.

TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC also committed identity theft. They obtained my identifying information such as my social security number to swindle the credit reporting agencies into reporting the fraudulent account. This use of my social security number was not authorized by I the consumer. 15 U.S.Code 1644 ( a ) 15 USC 1644 ( a ) 1644 ( a ) - Fraudulent authorized use of a credit card such as a license plate, social security card, XXXX card etc, can result up to a XXXX fine. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, the fraudulent use of a credit card, by TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC is defined as whoever uses, attempts or conspires to use a card to obtain money, goods or services shall be fined for {$10000.00} or imprisoned for 10 years or both. 

TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC used my social security account number the exact number on social security card to report information to my consumer report and to collect on a debt. 
This is a direct violation of 1644 ( a ) Also note that this matter could become even more serious if this issues isnt resolved because according to 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) -If i win a civil suit and file a class action, i can obtain up to XXXX $ or 1 % of the company. 

Notice, it is a fact, affiant is aware, If judgement is made against { TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC } I, the affiant, can and will pursue class action for the amount of XXXX $ to 1 % of your company in accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) meaning I could own a percentage of TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC or receive XXXX $ for TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC inconveniences to I the consumer.

The term Bureau means the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Consumer Reporting Agencies are not credit bureaus. The CFPB regulates the credit reporting agencies. 
I urge the CFPB to work swiftly and diligently with me on this matter to make sure TRANSWORLD SYSTEM INC and the credit reporting agencies XXXX and XXXX resolves this issue in a timely fair and equitable way for I, the consumer.

I had not authorized any credit pull, nor had I applied for any credit anywhere. I immediately contacted Transunion and was advised to file a police report and contact XXXX XXXX XXXX, which I did. After confirming my identity and researching it, XXXXXXXX XXXX confirmed that someone tried to use my information to obtain credit.

That was almost 5 months ago and the inquiry is still there. I filed a police report and provided the report number. Transunion is claiming I need to submit additional information and that XXXX has to submit additional information. XXXX claims they have sent Transunion the proper documentation. 

This is totally unacceptable. The company has advised Transunion that the credit inquiry was not authorized, I have told Transunion the credit inquiry was not authorized, and I sent them a police report confirming once again that the credit inquiry was not authorized.

2024-12-01,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"Subject : Urgent Request to Resolve Account Lock Due to Identity Verification Dear Bank of America Customer Support Team, My name is XXXX XXXX and I have been a loyal customer of Bank of America for the past 6 years. 
My account number is XXXX and I am writing to express my urgent concern regarding the complete block of my account, which has left me unable to access essential funds. 

Recently, I attempted to update my phone number in the Security Center of my online banking profile to reflect my current international contact number. The update was successful. However, on [ data exata do incidente ], while in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I attempted to use my debit card via XXXX XXXX for a transaction of approximately {$580.00}. The transaction was declined, and I received a verification prompt within the app, which I promptly confirmed To my dismay, the debit card remained blocked, and shortly after, my access to both the app and the Internet Banking platform was completely restricted. 

My Attempts to Resolve the Issue : I immediately contacted the Fraud Department and subsequently the Debit Card Department. Despite providing all the requested information and offering to submit any additional documents to verify my identity, I was informed that the only way to resolve this issue would be to appear in person at a Financial Center in the United States. 

This requirement is not feasible for the following reasons : 1.I am not in the XXXX XXXX , and my XXXX  has expired, which the renew was not have been applied yet.

2.Traveling to the United States is both logistically and financially impossible at this time. 

Impact of the Account Access Blocked : My account holds approximately {$700.00}, which I urgently need for living expenses. 
My XXXX daughters account, also with Bank of America, contains {$2000.00}, which she needs immediately for her regular expenses. 

Request for Resolution : I respectfully requested that Bank of America provide an alternative method for identity verification, given my circumstances. 
I am willing to submit any documentation necessary, including my passport, proof of residence, and any other information required to confirm my identity and resolve this issue remotely It is unreasonable and unfair to block access to essential funds without offering a viable alternative for customers residing abroad, especially when all necessary information to authenticate my identity has been provided. 

: I trust in Bank of Americas commitment to its customers and hope this matter can be resolved without further complications Please treat this as an urgent request and let me know the next steps I can take to regain access to my account. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX Account Holder : XXXX Phone : XXXX or XXXX Email : XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10988499

2024-12-01,Debt collection,Credit card debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"First, I Do Not Consent to be Surety of any alleged debt. I Do Not Consent to be Guarantor of any alleged debt. 

Numerous times starting XX/XX/year>, I have mailed TD Bank the attached Debt Validation and Debt Verification Requests ( delivered XX/XX/year> at XXXX XXXX  ), a Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure along with the Billing Error Notice, and a Notice to Opt Out of all Credit Reporting or Credit Furnishing through all Major Credit Reporting Agencies ( delivered XX/XX/year> at XXXX XXXX  ), and the Notice of Default and Final Statement ( delivered XX/XX/year> at XXXX XXXX  ) however TD Banks employees never properly responded to any of my Notices. They were never answered. They never followed my orders to Cease and Desist contacting me by phone instead TD Banks employees just kept harassing me with phone calls all throughout the day and mailing letters containing only partial statements. A half of a Statement is not a bill nor a proper Statement. They never sent me both the Accounts Receivable and the Accounts Payable.

Instead, they've used non-compliant and deceptive tactics to mislead me to make a payment of which I did not owe. As a Fiduciary, they never credited my account properly - according to the law. I was never given Valuable Consideration this entire agreement and TD Bank has been in default for a long time. They continue to report false information to my credit report or consumer report against my wishes and without my written permission which can be a form of identity theft ( a crime ). They are also violating several criminal and civil laws/ statutes of the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act ( includes the Federal Truth in Lending Act ) or Consumer Credit Protection Act ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) of the Statutes At Large. 

Upon further review, it is evident that the Issuer has committed several violations, rendering the contract or agreement unenforceable. Such as : 1. Lack of Mutual Assent and Consideration : The contract lacks mutual consent and valid or lawful consideration, violating the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) 3-104 and 3-303 regarding negotiable instruments and consideration. 

2. Absence of Issuers Signature : The Issuers failure to sign the agreement signifies a lack of Acceptance and agreement to the terms, thus failing to create a legally binding bilateral contract as required by UCC 3-401. 

3. Unconscionability : The terms of the agreement are unconscionable, imposing undue burdens solely upon [ Borrower 's Name ] without corresponding duties or risks assumed by the Issuer, in violation of the principles of fairness under UCC 2-302. 

4. Misrepresentation and Fraud : The Issuers representation of the instrument as a valid loan agreement, while failing to sign and thereby not committing to any obligation, constitutes a misrepresentation and potentially fraudulent inducement, violating Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) regulations under 16 CFR Part 433 and federal fraud statutes ( 18 U.S.C. 1341 and 1343 ).

5. Non-performance : The Issuer defaulted on its obligations by failing to properly respond and answer consumers questions and complaints in regard to the transaction. 

And other violations of law such as : 82 Stat. 152 CHAPTER 2 CREDIT TRANSACTIONS 121. General requirement of disclosure, 125. Right of rescission as to certain transactions, 127. Open end consumer credit plans, XXXX. Civil liability TITLE II EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS XXXX. Making extortionate extensions of credit, XXXX.

Part 3 - Criminal Penalties SECTION 37-5-301.Wilfull violations., SECTION 37-5-302.Disclosure violations., SECTION 37-5-303.Fraudulent use of cards. 

Notice and Demand Considering the many violations, those listed and those unlisted, XXXX XXXX hereby demands the following remedies : 1. Return of all Payments Made : Immediate return of all payments since the inception of the purported agreement. 

2. XXXX Balance on Account : Issuance of a balance of XXXX on the account, considering that the value was created by the instrument signed by XXXX XXXX and the funds were already generated. 

3. Removal of Negative and Derogatory information from all Consumer Reports/ Credit Reports : Immediate removal of negative items and derogatory/ defamatory information from all consumer reports or credit reports. 


Caveat / Warning If XXXX XXXX is unable to get any cooperation from TD Bank and its employees in regards to these violations of law then I will be put my States Attorney General on Notice because I will be launching a formal investigation with the ( CFPB ) Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the IRS Criminal Investigations Division, the FDIC Federal Deposit Insurance Commission, the Security and Exchange Commission and filing a Claim against TD Banks companys Bond and Insurers for the Misappropriation of Funds along with tax evasion, non-compliance and fraudulent and deceptive practices.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,SC,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10988528

Primary tabs ( a ) An instrument is transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument. 

( b ) Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee can not acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument. 

( c ) Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified indorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made. 

( d ) If a transferor purports to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of the instrument does not occur. The transferee obtains no rights under this Article and has only the rights of a partial assignee.",,"CAINE & WEINER COMPANY, INC.",MO,630XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10986388

Upon, Leaving the VA, I went to XXXX next door, I pulled out a Blower motor Relay to check if it was blown and the ABS Module relay, in which, XXXX relays had some corrision on them, I went into XXXX to see hiw much these relays would be. 
Upon leaving XXXX, I started the truck fine and let it warm up a little more, I than went to put the Truck into Reverse and found the I could not shift from park to reverse. 
Upon exiting the Truck, Observed that the headlights flashed several times, than I found that my rear light tail light was the only one working as to my drivers side headlight only worked, I reset the eletronic control module by touching the positive and negative battery cables together for 30 secs. The end result was the same. 
When calling XXXX Premium Extended Warranty for Approval, They informed me that it would cover XXXX, meaning to me that the tow was covered, I get a call from the towing company informing me of an unpaid balance of XXXX dollars which needed to be paid first? Not understanding any of this I paid it, the tow truck driver didnt understand why that was said when my warranty covered the deductable for XXXX dollars.

I just signed a contract to sell my home on XX/XX/XXXX, before foreclosure. 
First, they asked for the signed contract, and sent me an amount of XXXX due. This made sense, because the house sold for only XXXX, under the appraisal amount when I took out the loan. 
An email was sent with a payoff of XXXX also, several months ago. They originally sent me this before I signed the contract to sell. 

NOW- they are claiming the payoff is over XXXX. 

They are claiming, nthe home value of XXXX is the percentage they went by, when the Notice of Default was served, in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I am ready to close with the title company, but Point is kicking me while I'm down. I'm having to sell my house to avoid foreclosure I checked the Point contract and is states "" in some cases of default '', the payoff goes by what the value was at the time of the Notice of Default. 
Apparently this is "" some case '' because they chose to gouge me. 
There is something not right about this. 
Point low-balled my home appraisal, using their appraiser, ( bias ), when I was getting the loan.

But now they go by market value, when it's time for them to be paid back. 
They reneged on the correct payoff, the one I sent to the buyer. 
They knew about the Default all along, they are involved in the foreclosure lawsuit. 
Why even request the signed contract to begin with?

The vehicle was charged off in XXXX of XXXX by Veros Credit, However, Veros credit continued with threatening collection activities to include threats of repossession of the vehicle all the way through XX/XX/XXXX. 

I never received a XXXX from Veros Credit for the charge off that they claimed on my personal credit report which is still showing today XX/XX/XXXX as a charge off on my personal credit report which is impacting my overall XXXX score as a result of the incorrect reporting. 

I made an agreement with Veros credit to pay an agreed upon balance they claimed was still owed on the vehicle although they received a tax credit from the IRS for the written off balance owed on the vehicle. The reason why I made the agreement was because Veros Credit continued to threaten collections and repossession of the vehicle until the balance they claim was owed was paid on the vehicle. Therefore I am requesting a XXXX from Veros Credit which they were supposed to have provided to me once the account was charged off. 

I paid the agreed upon amount they requested and still had to wait over 4 months from Veros Credit to release the title to my vehicle. Veros Credit has caused a great deal of stress upon me during my dealing with their customer support and other departments within this past year alone regarding the account. I no longer choose to do any type of business with Veros Credit ongoing in the future and at this point, I am requesting a copy of the XXXX from Veros Credit that they were supposed to have provided to me once the account was charged off, so that my taxes can be prepared properly. 

Based upon my personal credit report, the account was charged off in XXXX of XXXX, however, Veros Credit continued to go after collections on the account through XXXX which resulted in my paying an agreed upon amount to settle the debt that they stated that I still owed on the account, although they received a tax credit from the IRS for the charge off amount on the account.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"VEROS CREDIT, LLC.",NC,27612,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978636

Each time I called there was a different answer or lack of information. I have been trying to get my refund for the last 14 months. I would be told "" It takes different time frames to wait for my refund '' only to call back to inquire on the whereabouts of it and be told it was canceled, the time frame to get a refund had run out, or Check back in so many days. If it were myself, owing them this money, they would be upset with all the runaround and lack of information I have been given. The bottom line is, that I want the refund of the amount I paid in when it was a time I did not have to make payments ( {$390.00} ). The very last time I called I was told my loan was now with XXXX but because it was in XXXX 's hands at the time of the refund period, Mohela would issue my refund after it came from the US Treasury. I am owed XXXX payments of {$190.00} ( XXXX ) but was told I was issued a refund for {$27.00} which is an odd amount and I am not sure what that is about. At the end of my phone call, I was told to check with XXXX about the matter which I did and they said also it would be Mohela to submit the request. I have filed a complaint with the XXXX  on this matter ( # XXXX ) and now, I am submitting a request/complaint to you. I need and want my refund, please. I hope you can go back and listen to the recorded messages when I inquired about my refund and also any requests and correspondence made in their systems. I have requested it but have never received any documentation. More training needs to happen within Mohela as it stands right now. Twice I asked for supervisors and was told they were not allowed to send me to a supervisor.

There was a fraudulent charge on my card. When it was reported, the agent actually chose to put a stop payment on for the charge, instead of notating in my file that the charge was reported as fraud.

I also asked why wasn't I given the option to have it rushed or expedited, but somehow it's impossible?

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Re : Formal Complaint Regarding Violation of FCRA and Improper Reporting of Paid Collection To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) regarding the inaccurate and improper reporting of a paid collection on my credit report. First of all it should never have been reported as a collection, I switched service addresses with XXXX  and instead of transferring services they created a whole new account instead of doing it properly. Despite paying this account in full, the creditor and the credit reporting agencies continue to inaccurately report it as unpaid or unresolved. This failure to update and verify accurate information is a clear violation of FCRA regulations, particularly 611 ( a ) and 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). 

Under the FCRA, furnishers and credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of consumer credit reports. The continued reporting of this paid collection account demonstrates blatant noncompliance with these standards. Additionally, I suspect that the XXXX system, which automates dispute processing, has failed to adequately investigate my dispute, violating my rights as a consumer. 

Specific Issues : 1. Violation of 611 ( a ) : The credit reporting agencies failed to perform a reasonable reinvestigation of the dispute I submitted regarding this account. 
2. Violation of 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : The data furnisher failed to report accurate information after being notified of the error. 
3. Improper Use of XXXX Codes : The use of inadequate XXXX codes likely resulted in an automated and insufficient dispute resolution process, failing to address my specific concerns. 

Requested Action : I demand the immediate removal of this collection account from my credit report as it has been paid in full and should no longer be reported as derogatory. Failure to correct this matter will leave me with no choice but to escalate this issue, including filing a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), exploring legal action, and seeking statutory damages for willful noncompliance under 616 of the FCRA. 

Attached, please find copies of the following : 1. Proof of payment for the collection account.

2. A copy of my credit report highlighting the inaccurate entry. 

I expect your acknowledgment of this complaint and resolution of the matter within 15 days, as outlined in the FCRAs procedural timeline.

Subsequently, I spoke to a Navient representative via phone and asked for clarification on the factors that Navient used to make their decision, so that I could try to satisfy them further.

Details of the Complaint : Debt Collector Information : Debt Collector : IQ Data International Claimed Debt Amount : {$3400.00} Background and Discrepancy : The alleged debt is related to a rental property. However, I have never been late on rent nor left any damages to the property in question. 
In fact, I have documentation from the property manager, including a move-out statement, which confirms that I left the property in good condition and fulfilled all rental obligations. This statement clearly states that no damages were caused, and my account was in good standing upon my departure. 
Action Taken : Upon receiving notice from IQ Data International regarding this debt, I immediately requested validation and supporting documentation to confirm the legitimacy of the debt. Despite this request, I have not received any proof or clear explanation showing why I am being held responsible for this alleged debt. 
I have also attempted to resolve the issue directly with IQ Data International though, but have received no satisfactory response or evidence to justify their claim.

Negative Impact : As a result of this unjust debt claim, my credit may have been negatively impacted, and it is causing unnecessary stress and confusion.

This inaccurate debt claim is affecting my ability to apply for credit and make important financial decisions. 
Supporting Documentation : Move-Out Statement from the property manager, confirming that I left the property in good condition and did not cause any damages.

2024-12-01,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Citibank for unlawfully denying my application for credit in violation of federal laws, specifically : The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), 15 U.S.C. 1691 The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 U.S.C. 1602 and 1611 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 12 U.S.C. 1431 Issue On XX/XX/year>, I applied for credit with Citibank and was subsequently denied without an adequate or legally valid explanation. Citibanks decision to d

eny my credit application appears to be in direct violation of the ECOA, which prohibits creditors from discriminating against any applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance ( 15 U.S.C. 1691 ).

Additionally, the ECOA and its implementing regulation, 12 C.F.R. 1002.9, require creditors to provide a specific reason for a denial of credit in a timely manner. Citibank either failed to provide an explanation or provided an insufficient explanation that does not comply with these legal standards. 
Furthermore, under the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1602 ), Citibank is obligated to disclose credit terms transparently and in good faith. Denying credit without valid reasoning undermines my rights under this statute and suggests non-compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1611, which prohibits creditors from knowingly failing to provide accurate disclosures or following legal obligations.

Legal Basis 15 U.S.C. 1691 ( ECOA ) : This provision prohibits discrimination and mandates clear, timely communication of reasons for credit denial.

12 C.F.R. 1002.9 : Requires creditors to issue a written statement detailing specific reasons for denying credit or informing the applicant of their right to request this information within 60 days.

15 U.S.C. 1602 & 1611 ( TILA ) : These provisions ensure that lending practices are conducted transparently and that any denial is justifiable and communicated effectively.

12 U.S.C. 1431 : This section governs federal oversight of lending practices and ensures that financial institutions operate in compliance with public and consumer protection laws.

Harm Caused The denial of credit has caused significant harm to me, including : Inability to meet my financial needs and goals due to lack of access to credit. 
Adverse effects on my creditworthiness and potential opportunities for future credit. 
Emotional distress and financial hardship as a result of being denied without proper justification.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",OH,44146,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978262
