2024-10-19,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Money was taken from your account on the wrong day or for the wrong amount,"I sent information regarding a fraudulent deduction of {$5200.00} from my checking account after a deposit was made. I have contacted NFCU and have not received the exact information I requested. My family is undergoing challenging circumstances at this time because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. So we need all the money we can save for her care. Unfortunately, at this critical time, I am having money transacted without appropriate controls and protections. The employees I have contacted have been extremely unresponsive and unprofessional. I am requesting a thorough investigation of the credit unions internal processes. There is absolutely no protection for vulnerable citizens like me. 

Subject : Immediate Action Required Regarding Check Deposit Rejection and Member Rights Dear [ NFCU Customer Service Manager ], I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction and serious concern regarding the mishandling of a check deposit I made in XXXX, which has only now resulted in a deduction of {$5200.00} from my account. This deduction was made without prior positive confirmation from NFCU, leaving me unable to investigate or trace the source of the issue with the originating bank. 

As a loyal NFCU member for over 25 years and a veteran of this great nation, I expect the utmost care and diligence in handling matters related to my account. I was alarmed to learn that the rejection of the deposit and subsequent deduction were communicated to me months after the deposit was made, a failure that reflects a significant breach of trust and fiduciary duty on NFCUs part. 

Furthermore, the lack of professionalism and empathy I encountered when seeking clarity from both an agent and a supervisor during my recent call is unacceptable. At no point did they show any concern for the gravity of the situation, nor was there any effort to escalate the matter so I could understand why I am just being notified today. 

Beyond my rights as a client, I am fully aware of my rights under federal banking regulations, including the right to timely notifications regarding deposits and withdrawals, as outlined in the Truth in Savings Act and other relevant federal statutes. The failure to notify me in a timely manner not only undermines my ability to protect my financial interests but also may constitute a violation of these regulations.

I request the following immediate actions from NFCU : 1. A full and transparent explanation for the delay in notifying me of the rejected deposit, including why the originating bank refused the check and why NFCU did not provide earlier notice. 
2. A detailed investigation into how this failure occurred, including a review of NFCUs internal processes and staff conduct in handling this issue.

3. Corrective actions and safeguards to ensure that such an egregious lapse in communication and customer service never occurs again. 

As a veteran who has dedicated XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to protecting the freedoms and rights of this country, I find it deeply troubling that NFCU, an institution I have trusted for so long, has failed to protect my financial security with the same level of care. I expect a response from a senior manager, outlining the steps NFCU will take to rectify this situation and restore my confidence in your institution. 

Please be aware that I am considering further actions, should this issue not be resolved to my satisfaction, including filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to ensure that my rights, as protected by federal law, are upheld. 

I look forward to a prompt response and a resolution to this matter. I trust NFCU will take this issue seriously and demonstrate the respect and attention owed to a long-standing member and veteran. Just saying that I am not the primary owner, and that my wife should have received an e-massage is simply heartless and morally wrong. XXXX should attempt to just walk XXXX steps and not even a mile in my shoes.

While I appreciate their investigation, I must strongly disagree with the conclusions drawn and reiterate that several inaccuracies remain unresolved on my credit report. Legal Basis for Disputing Inaccuracies Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I have the right to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information on my credit report. Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681b restricts the sharing of my information without my consent. As such, I expect these rights to be upheld in accordance with federal law. Further, relevant Ohio Revised Code ( ORC ) provisions include : ORC 1345.01 - Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act : This law prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in connection with the sale of goods or services. The reporting of inaccurate information on my credit report can be considered an unfair trade practice. ORC 1345.02 - Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices : The Ohio Attorney General has the authority to enforce this provision, which also protects consumers from false representations that may affect their creditworthiness.

XXXX XXXX XXXX : I dispute this collection account as I maintain that I never provided consent for this to be reported. Under FCRA 611 ( a ), I request proof of the debt and its legitimacy. Inquiries : The inquiries from XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are unauthorized and result from identity theft. Under FCRA 605B, I demand their immediate removal. Ohio Department of Human Services : A new entry has appeared on my credit report related to this agency. I request immediate clarification regarding this entry and its legitimacy. Department of EducationXXXX XXXX : New accounts reported from the Department of Education and XXXX are disputed. I assert that I did not consent to their inclusion on my credit report. Verification is required under FCRA 609. Request for Action Given the ongoing inaccuracies and the significant impact they have on my credit profile, I request that the CFPB facilitate a more thorough investigation into these matters to have them deleted. I urge the CFPB to ensure my rights under the FCRA and Ohio Revised Code are upheld, requiring that all inaccuracies be corrected or deleted. I am prepared to escalate this matter to legal proceedings if necessary, as the failure to resolve these inaccuracies has been causing significant harm to my credit profile, impacting my ability to secure housing and necessary services.

I dispute the validity of this debt and am immediately requesting that you provide the following information : 1. The original contract binding me to this so-called debt. 2. The PAYMENT HISTORY with the original creditor and balance. 3. Copy of PROOF OF DEBT ASSIGNMENT. 4. Proof that I legally owe this debt to YOUR agency. 5. Proof that you are licensed and able to collect on this debt in my state. 6. The original XXXXURCHASE AGREEMENT. A. THIS IS NOT ANY DEBT THAT I ORIGINATED MYSELF. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THIS DEBT ORIGINATED FROM. This inaccurate information needs to be re-investigated immediately by both the Credit reporting agencies and the furnishers of this information that is appearing on my consumer report. NOTE : As you can see within the screenshots that I have attached, XXXX removed this account 45 days ago. Please complete this file. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681e ( b ), A credit reporting agency must maintain accurate records at all times within the files of consumers. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681i, please perform an internal re-investigation on the validity of this account in question that is showing up on your consumer report under my name and notify me of your results within 30 days of your receipt of this letter and update my credit report accordingly to your findings. If you are unable to provide proof of my requests, then the erroneous information MUST be DELETED within 30 days of your receipt of this letter from my credit report as this erroneous account is very misleading and not mine. This account is causing me great mental anguish and I am unable to obtain a mortgage at this present time due to this inaccurate information on my credit report. Debt Collectors and Debt Buyers must furnish 100 % accurate information on consumers at all times. 15 USC 168s-2 Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information to Consumer Reporting Agencies ( a ) DUTY OF FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION ( 1 ) PROHIBITION ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. ( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors a person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. Please note that until the validity of this debt is verified, I demand that you CEASE all collection activities and CEASE REPORTING TO CREDIT BUREAUS IMMEDIATELY until complete and verified. Also, it is the duties of credit reporting agencies to uphold their grave responsibilities to supply 100 % accurate information ONLY on all consumer credit reports as the banking system itself hinges on accurate information. DELETE THIS ERRONEOUS INFORMATION from ALL credit bureaus immediately if the information can not be verified/validated.

Also enclosed is a copy of the FTC Notice to Furnishers of Information, which details your responsibilities as an information furnisher to credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ). As a furnisher, upon receipt of a consumers written request that encloses an Identity Theft Report, you are required to cease furnishing the information resulting from identity theft to any CRA.

The Notice also specifies your responsibilities when you receive notice from a CRA, under section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, that information you provided to the CRA may be the result of identity theft. Those responsibilities include ceasing to provide the inaccurate information to any CRAs and ensuring that you do not attempt to sell or transfer the fraudulent debts to another party for collection. 
Please investigate this matter, close the account and absolve me of all charges, take the steps required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and send me a letter explaining your findings and actions. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Enclosures : Account applications made on paper, online, or by telephone Account statements or invoices Records of payment or charge slips Delivery addresses associated with the account Records of phone numbers used to activate or access the account Signatures on applications and accounts Investigators report Please send me a letter explaining what you have done to : Inform XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, debt is the result of identity theft Stop collection proceedings against me Stop reporting information about the debt to credit reporting companies Provide me with the records I request Thank you for your cooperation. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX All furnishers of consumer reports must comply with all applicable regulations, including regulations promulgated after this notice was rst prescribed in 2004. Information about applicable regulations currently in e ect can be found at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's website, consumer nance.gov/learnmore. 
NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION : OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is set forth in full at the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection 's website at consumer nance.gov/learnmore. A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-referenced to the U.S. Code is at the end of this document.

Section 623 imposes the following dut
ies : Accuracy Guidelines The banking and credit union regulators and the CFPB will promulgate guidelines and regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers. The regulations and guidelines issued by the CFPB will be available at consumer nance.gov/learnmore when they are issued. Section 623 ( e ).

General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously speci es an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( C ).

Duty to Correct and Update Information If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer If a consumer noti es a furnisher, at an address speci ed by the furnisher for such notices, that speci c information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

If a consumer noti es a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).

The federal banking and credit union regulators and the CFPB will issue regulations that will identify when an information furnisher must investigate a dispute made directly to the furnisher by a consumer. Once these regulations are issued, furnishers must comply with them and complete an investigation within 30 days ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information ) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a credit repair organization. The CFPB regulations will be available at consumer nance.gov. Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer Reporting Agency If a CRA noti es a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information provided by the furnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The furnisher must : Conduct an investigation and review all relevant information provided by the CRA, including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ). 
Report the results to the CRA that referred the dispute, and, if the investigation establishes that the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain les on a nationwide basis. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( D ).

Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section 623 ( b ) ( 2 ).

Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ).

Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ). 
Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to pro t or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer 's le. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to pro t or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to nationwide consumer reporting agencies, as de ned in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA. Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 1022, App. B. Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices ( and such furnisher 's agents or assignees ) is a medica
l information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information.

Duties when ID Theft Occurs All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to noti cations from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identi ed as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623 ( a ) ( 6 ). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each consumer reporting agency of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). When any furnisher of information is noti ed pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity
theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances. Section 615 ( f ).

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE Account Numbers XXXX XXXX, This letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting my nonpublic and personal information without my written consent. Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party.

The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request.

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as Experian, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation.

**Details of the Complaint : ** 1. **Dispute Closure** : On [ XXXX, XXXX ], I submitted a dispute regarding certain inaccuracies found in my credit report. On XXXX ], I received notice from Experian that my dispute was closed, and the information was verified as correct.

2. **Subsequent Modifications** : However, I have recently observed that numerous modifications have been made to the disputed information in my credit report since it was closed. These modifications appear to be an attempt by Experian to contest its previous verification and to evade responsibility for the resulting harm and negligence that I have suffered due to the inaccuracies in my report.

3. **Investigative Requirements** : During this investigation, I stipulate that any continuing investigation into these items must include the disclosure of wet signatures and contracts associated with the accounts in question. If these documents can not be provided, I request that the account be removed from my credit report entirely as mandated by applicable regulations.

4. **FCRA Violations** : The actions taken by Experian constitute violations of the FCRA, specifically in relation to the accuracy of information reported and the obligations surrounding the dispute process. The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate records, and the changes made following the closure of my dispute suggest a failure to uphold that standard.

5. **FDCPA Violations** : Additionally, these actions may also reflect violations of the FDCPA, as they may be construed as unfair practices that impact my personal and financial well-being. I believe that the modifications made in an attempt to mitigate liability for your previous negligence exhibit behavior contradictory to the ethical standards mandated by the FDCPA.

**Resolution Requested** : I request that Experian : - Immediately cease all modifications to my credit report that have been made post-dispute closure.

- Provide me with a comprehensive explanation for the alterations made to my credit report while noting the basis for their legitimacy.

- Conduct a thorough investigation that includes the disclosure of wet signatures and contracts associated with the accounts in question ; if these can not be provided, the account should be removed from my credit report.

- Provide correction of the inaccurate information, ensuring full compliance with both the FCRA and FDCPA.

- Compensate me for any damages incurred due to these violations.

Please treat this complaint with urgency and the seriousness it warrants. I expect acknowledgment of this letter within 15 days and a detailed response regarding the actions that will be taken to rectify this situation. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE Account Numbers XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, This letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting my nonpublic and personal information without my written consent. Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 
The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as Experian, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

his letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting my nonpublic and personal information without my written consent. Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as Experian immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation.

The Notice also specifies your responsibilities when you receive notice from a CRA, under section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, that information you provided to the CRA may be the result of identity theft. Those responsibilities include ceasing to provide the inaccurate information to any CRAs and ensuring that you do not attempt to sell or transfer the fraudulent debts to another party for collection.

Information about applicable regulations currently in e ect can be found at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's website, consumer nance.gov/learnmore. 
NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION : OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is set forth in full at the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection 's website at consumer nance.gov/learnmore. A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-referenced to the U.S. Code is at the end of this document.

Section 623 imposes the following duties : Accuracy Guidelines The banking and credit union regulators and the CFPB will promulgate guidelines and regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers. The regulations and guidelines issued by the CFPB will be available at consumer nance.gov/learnmore when they are issued. Section 623 ( e ). 
General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously speci es an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( C ).

Duty to Correct and Update Information If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer If a consumer noti es a furnisher, at an address speci ed by the furnisher for such notices, that speci c information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

If a consumer noti es a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ). 
The federal banking and credit union regulators and the CFPB will issue regulations that will identify when an information furnisher must investigate a dispute made directly to the furnisher by a consumer. Once these regulations are issued, furnishers must comply with them and complete an investigation within 30 days ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information ) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a credit repair organization. The CFPB regulations will be available at consumer nance.gov. Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer Reporting Agency If a CRA noti es a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information provided by the furnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The furnisher must : Conduct an investigation and review all relevant information provided by the CRA, including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ). 
Report the results to the CRA that referred the dispute, and, if the investigation establishes that the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain les on a nationwide basis. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( D ).

Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section 623 ( b ) ( 2 ).

Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ). 
Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ). 
Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to pro t or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer 's le. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to pro t or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to nationwide consumer reporting agencies, as de ned in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA. Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has prescribed m
odel disclosures, 12 CFR Part 1022, App. B.

Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices ( and such furnisher 's agents or assignees ) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information. 
Duties when ID Theft Occurs All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to noti cations from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identi ed as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623 ( a ) ( 6 ). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each consumer reporting agency of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). When any furnisher of information is noti ed pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances. Section 615 ( f ).

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 
YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is, because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors I see, heres my breakdown : 1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act : Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate.

They are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied I am in distress because of your mistakes.

The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

1. Under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) this account in violation not reporting 100 % accurate.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Formal Complaint and Cease & Desist Notice Regarding Reporting of Late Payments Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding Experian 's continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by refusing to cease and desist from disclosing my nonpublic personal information, specifically late payments on Account # XXXX with XXXX XXXX , to non-affiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and Experian. 
Despite my previous attempts to resolve this issue, Experian has persisted in sharing this information, which I consider to be a clear breach of federal privacy laws. I am requesting your assistance in addressing this ongoing issue and protecting my consumer rights. 
Cease & Desist Notice This letter serves as a formal Cease & Desist Notice to Experian. I demand that Experian immediately stop reporting my late payments and any nonpublic personal information to third parties. Should this practice continue, I intend to pursue litigation under the FCRA and FDCPA to recover any monetary damages I may be entitled to under the law. 
Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation Experian 's continued reporting of late payments violates my rights under the FCRA, as it constitutes communication of nonpublic personal information. According to 15 USC 1692a ( 2 ), the term communication includes the conveying of information regarding a debt, either directly or indirectly, through any medium. By furnishing late payments to third-party credit reporting agencies, Experian is in direct violation of this provision. 
Additionally, 15 USC 6802 ( b ) prohibits financial institutions from disclosing nonpublic personal information to non-affiliated third parties without the explicit consent of the consumer. Experian has failed to provide any opportunity for me to opt out of this information sharing, which is also a violation of 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ). 
Violation of Consumer Rights Experian 's actions infringe upon my consumer and privacy rights. Not only have they shared my nonpublic personal information without my consent, but they have also failed to provide any clear and conspicuous options for opting out of such disclosures. This is in direct violation of 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ), which requires an explanation of how a consumer can exercise their right to prevent nonpublic personal information from being disclosed. 
To date, I have not been provided with any opt-out options, forms, notices, or clauses as required by law, either in the original agreement or on Experians website. If Experian asserts that these options were provided, I request that they furnish the original agreement demonstrating the provision of such options, as well as my ability to opt out. 
Request for CFPB Action I am asking the CFPB to take the following actions : Investigate Experian 's failure to comply with the FCRA and federal privacy laws regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information. 
Enforce Experians immediate cessation of reporting my late payments to non-affiliated third parties. 
Require Experian to provide an opt-out option for consumers in accordance with federal law and their privacy policy.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,MI,48174,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10511643

This dispute is submitted under my rights provided by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which entitles me to request full verification of any account reported on my credit file. An immediate investigation into the accuracy of this account is required. 

Nature of Dispute : Fraudulent Account : I am disputing this account as fraudulent. I have never opened an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and this account was opened without my authorization. I have submitted an Identity Theft Report to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department, both of which are enclosed with this letter. 
Failure to Verify Information : The balance, account status, and other reported information are inaccurate. The account shows a balance of {$320.00} and past-due status as of XX/XX/XXXX, yet XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to provide proper documentation validating this debt. I demand full verification of this account, including a copy of the original contract with my wet signature. 

Legal Demands for Verification : Pursuant to FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), I demand that Experian provide me with : 1. A copy of the original contract for this account with my wet signature as proof of validation. A mere statement or computer-generated record is insufficient and does not constitute legal proof of this debt. 
2. Verification of all information reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX, including the balance, payment history, and account status. 

Failure to Provide Verification : If XXXX XXXX XXXX  can not provide the requested documentation, as required by FCRA Sections 611 and 623, you are obligated to delete this account from my credit file. Reporting unverifiable or inaccurate information is a violation of the FCRA, and I expect this to be resolved promptly. 

Supporting Documentation : A copy of my FTC Identity Theft Affidavit A copy of the XXXX Police Department Identity Theft Report A copy of my UCC-11 filing indicating no legitimate claim from XXXX XXXX XXXX Expected Resolution : If this account can not be fully verified within 30 days, I expect it to be deleted from my credit file in accordance with FCRA guidelines. Please confirm receipt of this dispute and notify me of the outcome once your investigation is complete. 

This letter has been sent via certified mail with a return receipt requested to ensure timely processing. Should this dispute remain unresolved, I will file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and pursue further legal action if necessary.

2024-10-19,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"I am writing to formally dispute the removal of my credit history with XXXX XXXX and the inaccurate classification of a {$6.00} balance as fraud on my credit report. After contacting XXXX, I was informed that the removal of my account from my credit report was based on Experians reporting that the {$6.00} balance was fraudulent. However, I wish to clarify that this transaction was not fraudulent and should not have been reported as such. 

Background of the Dispute : Experians Misclassification of Fraud : On [ insert date ], I filed a dispute through Experian regarding a {$6.00} balance on my XXXX XXXX XXXX This dispute was intended to challenge the accuracy of the amount but not to claim it as fraudulent. However, Experian incorrectly classified this dispute as fraud, which has led to the complete removal of my XXXX account from my credit history. 

XXXX  Response : After contacting XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, I was informed that XXXX  requires a letter from Experian stating that the {$6.00} balance was not a fraudulent transaction in order to restore my credit history. XXXX has expressed that they can not reinstate the account until this matter is resolved. 

Legal Basis for My Dispute : Under federal law, specifically the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., both consumer reporting agencies like Experian and creditors like XXXX have the obligation to ensure the accuracy of the information provided on credit reports. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ), when information is disputed and later found to be accurate or inaccurate for reasons other than fraud, the appropriate correction must be made, and the reporting agency must notify the creditor of any changes. In this case, the failure to correct this error has caused significant damage to my credit profile. 

Furthermore, under Texas state law, particularly the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, and XXXX  XXXX, any consumer reporting agency or financial institution operating in Texas is required to ensure accurate information is reported and to provide prompt correction when errors are discovered. XXXX  refusal to restore my credit history without a letter from Experian violates their duty to report accurate credit information. 

Requested Resolution : Experian : I request that you promptly issue a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX indicating that the {$6.00} balance was not fraudulent and that the previous dispute was solely about the accuracy of the balance. This letter should also state that the XXXX XXXX account was erroneously removed due to this misclassification. 

XXXX XXXX : Upon receipt of this letter from Experian, I request that you immediately reinstate my credit history with XXXX, reflecting my full and accurate account activity. 

This situation has caused significant harm to my credit profile, and I expect prompt resolution in accordance with the applicable federal and state laws. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to seek legal remedies to address the damage caused by this misreporting.

Please respond to this dispute in writing within 30 days, as required by the FCRA and Texas state law, with confirmation that the issue has been resolved.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,77494,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10511695

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is, because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors I see, heres my breakdown : 1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers.

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I recently conducted a review of my credit report and found several items that have caused me significant distress. These items appear to be unverifiable, inaccurate, and questionable. Your agency has failed to ensure the accuracy of the information as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports. This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report.

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors. I have never entered into a valid contract with any of these entities, nor have I engaged in any transactions with them. As such, these accounts are fraudulent and may be the result of identity theft or other illegal activities. Attempting to enforce these fraudulent accounts is unlawful. I request that you expedite your investigation to prevent further harm, losses, or damages that I may suffer as a victim of identity theft. 

Moreover, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, my right to privacy has been violated, and this breach infringes upon my rights as outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I hope youre doing well! I wanted to share something that's been bothering me lately regarding my credit report. I recently checked it and found some inaccuracies that I need to address. 

There are several accounts listed that seem to be inconsistent, and its really confusing. Here are the accounts Im talking about : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX The problem is that theyre not reporting the information consistently. When I look at my credit profile, its clear that the details dont match up, which is super frustrating. This inconsistency could really affect my creditworthiness. 

I already wrote to the credit bureaus about these issues, but I havent heard back from them yet. Its been a bit of a hassle, and Im starting to get anxious about it. I just want to make sure everything is accurate!

I also referenced some sections of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) in my complaint to support my case. Specifically, I mentioned : - **Section 609 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) ** : This section requires the consumer reporting agency to provide consumers with the information in their file upon request.

- **Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) ** : This gives consumers the right to dispute inaccurate information and request an investigation.

- **Section 605 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) ** : This limits how long negative information can be reported, ensuring that inaccuracies are corrected promptly. 

Just wanted to vent a little and keep you in the loop. Please help if possible.

On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to use my card for a personal separate account at an ATM. My pin is no longer working. I tired to call PNC for assistance and they told me they could not help. However, this very same pin works just fine in accessing mobile banking and the automated system. 

Somehow, they have deactivated my cards and I no longer have access to our joint checking, or my personal checking account. 

As if XX/XX/XXXX my husbands card has not arrived, but mine has. However, I can not activate it and my personal checking account card is also not functional and on mobile banking they no longer show as valid. 

I am unable to go to a branch due to health issues and work hours, and I am locked out of my account with no way to pay bills or eat. We are forced to use a credit card to get by. PNC offers no assistance on the website, app, or over the phone. 

This needs to be fixed immediately. A new card needs to be sent overnight to my husband and PNC needs to send me new cards with the correct pin assigned overnight and help me regain access to my accounts.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So, whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent.

XXXX Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Deceptive Mortgage Practices and Illegal Collection Tactics Dear Sir/Madam : I am writing to formally complain about TD Bank 's handling of my mortgage forbearance and subsequent attempts to collect an outstanding balance. 

Due to job loss and severe financial distress, I sought a mortgage forbearance, which TD Bank approved. Upon concluding the forbearance period, I was informed by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year>, that I could have the forbearance balance added to the rear of my loan. I consented and was assured that this request was submitted to underwriting. 

Despite my proactive efforts to clarify and finalize this request, including multiple communications with TD Bank representatives, I have seen no resolution. My documented interactions include : - XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX requested the loan forbearance amounts be added to my loan 's end. 
- XXXX XXXX : Two inquiries were made to underwriting regarding adding amounts from the forbearance period. 
- XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX informed me that an email had been sent for account updates, confirming the matter was pending with underwriting. 
- XXXX XXXX : I escalated the issue to supervisor XXXX ( XXXX ) due to adverse actions impacting my credit report. 

Despite being assured of no adverse actions while my loan was under review, TD Bank has reported late payments for 120 days and an outstanding balance of {$12000.00} to credit bureaus. This has resulted in my credit score plummeting from XXXX to XXXX, creating severe personal and financial hardship. 

I believe TD Bank 's practices in this situation violate ethical and possibly legal standards. I urge you to address this matter expeditiously, rectify the inaccuracies reported to the credit bureaus, and ensure fair treatment moving forward. 

If this issue remains unresolved, I will be forced to seek legal counsel and consider sharing my experience publicly to highlight these questionable practices, particularly concerning how they disproportionately affect individuals in marginalized communities. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Credit inquiries on your report that you don't recognize,"I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding unauthorized credit inquiries made by three financial institutions : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX all reporting on my Experian credit report, dated XX/XX/XXXX. These banks made hard inquiries on my Experian credit report without my knowledge or consent, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which governs permissible purposes for credit inquiries. Under the FCRA, a creditor must have a legitimate purpose, such as my explicit authorization, a credit transaction initiated by me, or a court order, to access my credit report. I have not applied for credit or had any transactions with the aforementioned banks that would justify such inquiries. Their actions are in direct violation of my consumer rights. 

The following case law is relevant to my complaint : XXXX. Pintos v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  XXXX ) - in this case, the Ninth circuit ruled that the Fair Credit Reporting Act does not allow for a credit inquiry without a permissible purpose. The court held that accessing a consumers credit report without explicit authorization or a valid credit-related reason is an FCRA violation. 

XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) - The XXXX XXXX ruled that companies that make unauthorized inquiries or do not have a valid reason for obtaining consumer reports can be held liable for violations of the FCRA, reinforcing the need for consent or a permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. 1681b. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( C.D. XXXX. XXXX ) - This case reaffirmed that unauthorized inquiries into a consumers credit history violate the FCRA, and the consumer is entitled to statutory damages and other relief if the inquiry was made without consent or legitimate reason. 

These hard inquiries have negatively impacted my credit score, and I believe I am entitled to relief, including the removal of these unauthorized inquiries from my credit report and any statutory damages as provided under the FCRA. 

I am requesting that the CFPB Investigate this matter and hold these institutions accountable for their unauthorized actions and furthermore, remove and delete these inquiries off of my Experian credit report. Please provide me with updates on the investigation and let me know if any further information is needed. 

Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Subject : Final Warning Dispute Under FCRA 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) and FCRA 1681e ( b ) This letter serves as my final warning to Experian regarding the 10 inaccurate accounts listed on my credit report. I have previously disputed these accounts, yet you continue to report them despite your obligation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) and 1681e ( b ).

It is evident that your investigation into my dispute was both lazy and inadequate. By relying on the automated e-OSCAR system to handle the investigation, you have completely failed to meet your statutory obligations to conduct a thorough and reasonable review of the disputed information. The law demands that Experian use reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy, and this reliance on an automated system is a blatant violation of FCRA 1681e ( b ).

Additionally, when you claim to have updated the information in response to my dispute, the reality is that no such update was made. The accounts remain exactly as they were, and this false representation is yet another violation of your responsibilities under the FCRA. You are required by law to remove or correct inaccurate and unverifiable information. Continuing to report these accounts in their current form is not only misleading, but also a clear demonstration of your willful disregard for federal consumer protection laws. 

If you do not delete these 10 accounts from my credit report immediately, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter further. I am prepared to file a lawsuit against Experian for willful non-compliance with the FCRA, and I will also be notifying the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) of your violations.

This is your final opportunity to correct your errors and comply with the law. I expect confirmation of the removal of the disputed accounts from my credit report within [ set a reasonable time, e.g., 10 days ]. Failure to do so will result in legal action without further notice.

This version emphasizes that Experians reliance on e-OSCAR violates their duty to conduct a proper investigation, while also addressing their failure to update or remove the incorrect information. The letter warns of legal action if the issues are not corrected promptly.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,77017,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10495704

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So, whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-XXXX. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent. I was reviewing my consumer reports and noticed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX on my credit report that need be immediately updated to paid as agreed.

This account is causing me great mental anguish and I am unable to obtain a mortgage at this present time due to this inaccurate information on my credit report. Debt Collectors and Debt Buyers must furnish 100 % accurate information on consumers at all times. 15 USC 168s-2 Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information to Consumer Reporting Agencies ( a ) DUTY OF FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION ( 1 ) PROHIBITION ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. ( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors a person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. Please note that until the validity of this debt is verified, I demand that you CEASE all collection activities and CEASE REPORTING TO CREDIT BUREAUS IMMEDIATELY until complete and verified. Also, it is the duties of credit reporting agencies to uphold their grave responsibilities to supply 100 % accurate information ONLY on all consumer credit reports as the banking system itself hinges on accurate information.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Immediate Demand for Deletion and Suppression of Fraudulent Information Due to Identity Theft To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to demand the immediate deletion and suppression of fraudulent information currently present in my credit file. As a victim of identity theft, I did not authorize or make the charges associated with the items listed in the enclosed report. This false information is damaging my credit report, and I require that it be corrected without delay. 

I reported the theft of my identity to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and have enclosed copies of the FTCs Identity Theft Affidavit as supporting evidence. Despite this, it has been over 30 days, and your agency is now in VIOLATION of federal law for failing to take the necessary action to correct my credit file. 

As per 15 U.S. Code 1681c2, a consumer reporting agency must block the reporting of any fraudulent information in the file of a consumer, identified as resulting from identity theft, no later than four days after receiving notice. This legal requirement has been ignored, and I demand that the fraudulent items be deleted and suppressed immediately. 

Your agency 's failure to comply with this statute and take swift corrective action is unacceptable. I expect full compliance with federal law and that my credit report be accurately updated within the next few days. If you continue to ignore this request, I will not hesitate to seek legal recourse to enforce my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

I anticipate a prompt response and resolution of this matter. Please confirm in writing once the requested deletions and suppressions have been completed.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,SC,29169,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10496793

Due to my XXXX I was unaware of these activities until my condition improved, at which point I began submitting disputes with both the creditors and credit bureaus. The creditors have investigated and confirmed the accounts were fraudulent, issuing deletion letters. Several creditors also confirmed that the transaction records are no longer available due to the age of the accounts and transfers to multiple parties. In other cases, creditors deleted the accounts without requiring further investigation based on the strength of the evidence. 

However, Experian continues to report these fraudulent accounts. Despite having provided the FTC Identity Theft Report, proof of identity, and creditor deletion letters multiple times, Experian refuses to delete these accounts, citing that I may have benefited from the transactions a baseless claim, especially since no transaction records have been provided to me, nor do the original creditors possess them. I have requested these transaction records from both Experian and the creditors for over a year to no avail. 

Experian 's implication that I benefited from these transactions, without providing any proof, is deeply harmful and unsupported by any evidence. Their failure to produce the transaction records or provide a detailed investigation contradicts their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Furthermore, I understand that credit reporting bureaus do not generally maintain transaction records ; however, since Experian is referring to these transactions, I suspect they may have more access to this data than they are disclosing. 

Additionally, I am not interested in providing more evidence as I have already submitted more than is legally required. Every prior complaint includes the FTC Identity Theft Report, hospice certification, and the creditor deletion letters. I am also documenting all communication for a future lawsuit, as my health currently prevents me from pursuing litigation.

I believe this issue is a result of an error and needs to be corrected promptly. I have attached supporting documentation for your review.

The details of the account are as follows : XXXX Account Number : [ XXXX ] Creditor : XXXX XXXX. 
Resolution Date : XX/XX/year> ( as indicated in the attached documentation from XXXX ) As outlined in the attached correspondence from XXXX, this debt was fully resolved, and I received confirmation that no balance is owed. Despite this, my credit report still reflects a negative charge-off for this account. The continued reporting of this debt as unresolved is inaccurate and unjustified.

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assist in having this negative information removed from my credit report, as it no longer applies. This correction should be reflected with all three major credit bureaus : XXXX, Experian, and XXXX. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to confirmation of the removal of this erroneous information.

Details of the Complaint : Dispute Filed with Experian : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a formal dispute to Experian ( Dispute ID : XXXX ), requesting the removal of inaccurate accounts, late payments, charge-offs, and inquiries from my credit report. My dispute explicitly stated that Experian must exclude third-party data sources, such as XXXX, and verify the information directly with the original creditors, as required under FCRA 609 and 611.

Failure to Respond within 30 Days : As of today, more than 30 days have passed since Experian received my dispute on XX/XX/year>, and I have not received any formal response or documentation from Experian regarding the investigation of the disputed items. This failure to respond violates FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ), which mandates that consumer reporting agencies complete their investigation and provide a response within 30 days.

Failure to Remove Inaccurate Accounts : In my dispute, I identified multiple inaccurate items, including late payments, charge-offs, and hard inquiries that should be removed from my credit report. I have attached a list of the disputed items for reference. Despite the clear inaccuracies, Experian has failed to take any corrective action, and these accounts continue to negatively affect my credit. 

List of Disputed Items ( Previously Submitted to Experian ) : Late Payments : Accounts from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the Office of the Attorney General ( Child Support ). 
Charge-offs : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Hard Inquiries : Multiple inquiries, including XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX : I request that the CFPB take immediate action to ensure that Experian : Deletes all inaccurate and unverifiable accounts from my credit report as per my dispute. 
Complies with the FCRAs 30-day timeframe for responding to disputes.

Provides detailed documentation of the investigation, including verification with original creditors, as required by FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ).

Enclosed are copies of the dispute letter I sent to Experian, my 15-day follow-up letter, and relevant credit report documentation showing the inaccurate items that remain on my credit report.

I trust the CFPB will take prompt action to ensure Experian complies with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and provides the necessary corrections to my credit report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,77084,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10512664

XXXX XXXX XXXX failure to provide a response leaves me no choice but to assume that you have neglected to comply with FEDERAL law by not filing a 1099-C as mandated. Consequently, I am compelled to inform you that I will report XXXX  XXXX XXXX to the XXXX  for potential tax fraud using Form XXXX if prompt action is not taken. 

Furthermore, it is imperative that you notify Experian, XXXX, and XXXX to delete this information from my credit report immediately. The account in question is detailed as follows : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX per IRS regulations, a canceled debt of {$600.00} or more necessitates the filing of a 1099-C form by federal or government agencies, or applicable financial entities. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes tax fraud, a serious offense that I will not hesitate to report to the IRS. 

It is essential to understand that a canceled debt is considered ordinary income by the IRS. Consequently, any failure to file a 1099-C form, or any attempt to conceal such actions, constitutes inaccurate reporting. Income is not to be included on a credit report, and any such inclusion violates consumer laws and regulations.

Your company 's actions are in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC 1681s-2, which outlines the responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies. Under this statute, it is prohibited to furnish inaccurate information knowingly or with reasonable cause to believe it is inaccurate. 

It is evident from my previous communication and this notice that there is reasonable cause to believe the information provided is inaccurate. Therefore, it is imperative that you take immediate steps to rectify this situation by deleting the inaccurate information from all consumer reporting agencies. 

Failure to comply will result in legal action being pursued, including holding the Creditor XXXX  XXXX XXXX, accountable for willful noncompliance under 15 USC 1681n ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). This statute stipulates that any person who willfully fails to comply with FCRA requirements may be liable for damages sustained by the consumer.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So, whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent. I was reviewing my consumer reports and noticed XXXX XXXX on my credit report that need be immediately updated to paid as agreed. My Consumer rights have been violated by Experian, XXXX, XXXX. Experian, XXXX, XXXX has violated my consumer rights and violated federal law. This is now multiple attempts to notify you of this erroneous error on the part of your agency. This erroneous late payment is affecting my ability to obtain a loan to save my business from crumbling and also blocking me from the housing that I so desperately need for myself and my family. Please change this to paid as agreed immediately so that I may proceed with my life, or I may be forced to seek legal damages against your agency as I already have sought legal counsel in this more than important matter.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, a natural-born person and not a third party, am submitting this complaint regarding Experians failure to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) in relation to the deletion of fraudulent accounts, unauthorized hard inquiries, and incorrect personal information listed on my credit report. 

I have been a victim of identity theft, which has been exacerbated by the XXXX data breach, along with breaches at XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, in which my personal information was compromised. Despite my disputes, Experian has failed to act within the time frames mandated by law, violating my rights as a consumer. For your review, I have enclosed my notarized Identity Affidavit, along with an FTC Identity Theft Report and proof of identity, to substantiate my claims. 

Key Timeline : Initial Dispute : Filed on XX/XX/XXXX Follow-up Dispute : Filed on XX/XX/XXXX Despite being informed by a representative from Experian that the fraudulent accounts and unauthorized inquiries would be deleted due to my victim status in the data breach, no action has been taken, and I have not received any response to my follow-up communication. 

Key Issues : Fraudulent Accounts : The following accounts were opened fraudulently without my consent : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) Unauthorized Hard Inquiries : The following hard inquiries were conducted without my consent : XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( Inquiry dates : XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Inquiry date : XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( Inquiry dates : XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Inquiry date : XX/XX/XXXX ) Incorrect Personal Information : There are inaccuracies in my credit report regarding my past addresses and employment history : Incorrect address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, DE XXXX Incorrect employer : XXXX XXXX and EMPLOYED Correct employer information is XXXX XXXX and XXXX. 
XXXX Data Breach Impact : As a victim of the XXXX XXXX data breach, my personal information, including my Social Security number, was exposed and used in fraudulent activities. Despite being vigilant about protecting my identity, the data breach significantly increased my vulnerability to identity theft. My compromised information has been used to open fraudulent accounts and inquiries on my credit report, which are directly linked to the breach. 

Additionally, I have been a victim of other major data breaches, including those at XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, further compounding the issue. These breaches have resulted in unauthorized activity on my credit report, which Experian has failed to resolve despite multiple disputes. 

Applicable Laws Violated : FCRA Section 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) : As a victim of identity theft, I am entitled to have fraudulent accounts and inaccurate information blocked within four days of reporting. Despite my detailed disputes, Experian has failed to block or remove these accounts and inquiries in violation of Section 605B.

FCRA Section 605C : The fraudulent accounts and inquiries should have been deleted within four business days of my initial dispute. This delay in removing inaccurate information is a clear violation of my rights under Section 605C.

15 U.S. Code 1681b : Experian unlawfully allowed my consumer report to be accessed without my written consent, as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681b. The fraudulent inquiries must be removed as they were conducted without my authorization.

18 U.S.C. 1028A : The fraudulent accounts and identity theft situation also constitute aggravated identity theft, which is a federal crime. I have enclosed proof of identity theft through my notarized Identity Affidavit, FTC Identity Theft Report, and proof of identity. 

Impact on My Life : This unresolved identity theft and Experians failure to remove fraudulent items have caused severe financial hardship. My creditworthiness is significantly impacted, preventing me from obtaining a mortgage for my family. I am also preparing for XXXX overseas, and this has added unnecessary stress during this critical time.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30122,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10497363

The actual payment date or proof that no payment was made.

Any notices or warnings they claim to have issued regarding the alleged late payment.

Violation of FCRA Requirements : Under the FCRA, furnishers of credit information are required to verify and provide accurate records when a consumer disputes the accuracy of information reported to credit bureaus.

Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 

The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I canceled my existing autopay with EdFinancial because I had transferred to a new checking account, and wanted to set up auto pay with the new checking account. For the month of XXXX, I simply made a manual payment to cover my student loan payment. 

After setting up auto pay with my new checking account, I received a confirmation email and I assumed I was all set. I had set up my autopay to clear on the XXXX of every month. On XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a delinquency notice because my auto pay had not gone through on XX/XX/XXXX. I thought this was strange since I had set it up with my new bank account on XX/XX/XXXX, so I re-submitted my autopay request, and made another manual payment. 

The same exact thing happens after XX/XX/XXXX ... no auto payment had gone through. I reach out to EdFinancial and the only feedback I receive is that it takes XXXX billing cycles for my autopay to be confirmed by them. It's been over 2 months now since XX/XX/XXXX when I enrolled in my new auto pay, and I still have not heard back from them with a confirmation that it works. 

I find this unacceptable given that with autopay, you receive a 0.25 % interest reduction. By not being clear about the auto pay process, and relying on outdated technology that can not handle starting auto payment the same day you enroll, borrowers must wait months to receive their promised interest rate reductions.",,EdFinancial Services,DC,20009,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10510785

This rate was presented to me on my logged in BoA portal ( i.e., they knew who I was based on my existing accounts and my 40 year history as their consumer ). Based on this advertisement, I applied for the loan and allowed BoA to run my credit report, which of course negatively impacts my credit score. After being quickly approved, they presented me with my approved loan rate of 5.99 %, 90 basis points higher than they quoted. I called BoA and expressed my frustration. The agent I spoke with said, of course, different variables impact the rate. As we walked through each variable ( e.g., I have excellent credit which BoA just ran and confirmed, I was getting a Gold tier relationship benefit, etc, ) he acknowledged that hes not sure why I didnt get the advertised 5.09 % it was a complete bait and switch scenario.

I went into the CHASE bank to cash-in mXXXX XXXX, instead of renewing. And was issued a check for the balance, plus interest, of {$120000.00}.

I am utterly fed up with their tactics and the apparent lack of oversight from the credit bureausXXXX XXXXXXXX, and XXXX. 

Despite my ongoing dispute, Portfolio Recovery continues to manipulate my credit report, adding information as they see fit. Its as if they have been given XXXX  XXXX to disregard my rights. I have requested debt validation, yet they responded with nothing more than a vague statement from XXXX XXXX, which does not constitute proof of debt. I now demand an Assignment letter to review the purchase agreement related to this alleged debt, as I deserve to know the details of this transaction. 

Moreover, XXXX previously stated that Portfolio Recovery would be removed from my credit report. However, I have provided evidence that they have not only remained on my report but are actively making updates across all three bureaus. This behavior is unacceptable. 

During my attempts to resolve this, I encountered a representative who dismissively stated, "" If we say you owe this debt, then you owe this debt. '' This encounter made it painfully clear that I am dealing with a bully, not a legitimate creditor. Their tactics have left me feeling victimized, and I refuse to engage with them any further. 

The harassment I have endured through my credit reports is not only insane but also deeply disrespectful. I will not stand for it any longer, and I am prepared to escalate this matter to court if necessary. 

I urge the CFPB to investigate Portfolio Recovery Associates and their practices. No one should have to endure such treatment. 

Attached are pictures of the different balances Portfolio Recovery initially reported to the 3 credit bureaus ( {$300.00} and {$300.00} ).

Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 
The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation.

It cause several account to be sent to collecttions. Bank of America sent my Bank of America Credit Card to collections when i had perfect payment history. I have been with the bank for 20 years.

They blamed a third part vendor who maintained the bill pay, bill pay blamed the bank. No one was held accountable. And the funds wher not completely refunded and the damage was not undone.

I was on the phone for months trying to repair their misstake. 6 months into it they claimed they could only look back 30 days when the mistake had happen a year before and i had been on the claims and fraud protection for montsh about it but becaue i would not except their misstake they just simple said we can only go back 30 days.

That one error cause all my automatic bill payment accounts to be sent to collections. Which dropped my XXXX XXXX down to a XXXX. I lost all my other credit card, my loans all went into default. I did not catch the error unitll several months after it occured when i recieved a credit report and all my accounts where sent to collections. 

I contacted the credit company and they claimed they did a investigation and could not do anything becuse the accounts whe confirmed. I contacted them repeatedly, I contacted the bank repeatedly. Several months into it the bank confirmed they mistake. 

The XXXX XXXX claimed they investigation was done when it was not. If you looked at my payment history alone it would be obvious there was a mistake becaue I have perfect payment history becaue all by bills where on automatic bill pay for years. 

I have tried repeatedly to get my credit card returned and reactivated but my credit report is so ugly wont even my own back reissue the card they fraudulently sent to collections. I was told the algorithm kept kicking my application back and that i have to subbmitte a request in writeing which i did. 

I requested my account be looked at, that a supperior card be issued and a increase in my credit limit and repayment of the fees and charges and lose and damages. I have not heard anything in 8 months.

Whole life insurance pending in both legal and given name is not okay. Date of birth to unknown beneficiary but my mother did ask me what day it was deposited in my account.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE Account Numbers- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, This letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting my nonpublic and personal information without my written consent. Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 

The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX XXXX immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 
YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. 
Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is, because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors I see, heres my breakdown : 1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act : Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes. 
Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions. 
Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable. 
Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ). 
I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate. 
They are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied I am in distress because of your mistakes. 
The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

According to the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 611 ( a ) [ 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ], these disputed items must be investigated or deleted from my credit record within 30 days. The items I am disputing must be removed from my credit report as the mere reporting of items prior to debt validation constitutes collection activity. I have contacted the Federal Trade Commission and filed a police report. I am demanding that you remove all inaccurate accounts from my credit profile in the next five ( 5 ) days or I will have no other recourse but to file an injunction against your agency under 617a1 which makes you financially liable for each inaccurate account. Also, under 616 Section A liability for willful non-compliance, your agency has yet to respond to my questions and statements of the Law.

AFFIDAVITS OF LAW 1. Are you the original creditor?

2. Have you given the debtor the opportunity to review the original contract?

3. Have you validated the home address for the debtor?

4. Have you complied with all FRCA, FDCP and FDCPA laws?

5. Have you reported to the consumer who has reviewed the original contract information with his/her original signature?

6. Have you provided the names of all creditors that have provided the names and addresses of the person who has reviewed consumer relations? 

Accounts : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX If the above has not been completed, please Delete these accounts from my credit report and stop all contact with me. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 805., you are hereby notified to CEASE AND DESIST all further communication with me regarding the referenced debt. Failure to abide by this law will result in a complaint being filed against you with the Federal Trade Commission, the Attorney General of both your state and mine, and also your company management. I also have the right to file suit against you for any future violations of this law.

These items appear to be unverifiable, inaccurate, and questionable. Your agency has failed to ensure the accuracy of the information as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports. This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report. 

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors. I have never entered into a valid contract with any of these entities, nor have I engaged in any transactions with them. As such, these accounts are fraudulent and may be the result of identity theft or other illegal activities. Attempting to enforce these fraudulent accounts is unlawful. I request that you expedite your investigation to prevent further harm, losses, or damages that I may suffer as a victim of identity theft.

Moreover, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, my right to privacy has been violated, and this breach infringes upon my rights as outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974. Removing the inaccurate and fraudulent information from my credit report will help restore my privacy and prevent further violations.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MD,21202,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10509058

I paid this credit card off in full. A month later XXXX XXXX XXXX called me trying to sell me a service called XXXX  XXXX. I declined these services. XXXX XXXX XXXX  then charged my account anyways for a {$0.00} charge labeled XXXX XXXX per the credit card statement.

I tried to tell XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and now Midland Credit Management that this is because of illegal charges on my account. You can not charge someone for credit card insurance that they never agreed to. Noone will listen to me or help me even though they provided me the statement with the proof that clearly says this charge was not for any previous interest, previous purchase, or interest from current billing cycles..Meaning this is not leftover interest from the previous billing cycle which is what they tried to tell me until I showed them the proof. The account was paid off on XX/XX/year>. The illegal charge for the {$0.00} XXXX XXXX insurance was put on my account on XX/XX/year>. Again, I have asked for Midland and XXXX to supply me with an electronic or physical signature that says I signed up for this to cause this charge and they can't. I paid it off with no intention of ever using it again so there is no reason I would need account insurance. They have to supply proof of this and they can't because I never agreed. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and Midland should all be held legally liable for the damage they have done and for seeing the proof of what I'm saying is true and pretending they don't. A woman at Midland even agreed with me that this was illegal then I never heard from her again. They keep trying to come after me for payment anyways.

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately.

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA XXXX, because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors I see, heres my breakdown : 1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation? 
Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up XXXX person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes. 
XXXX. My rights under the fair credit reporting act : Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes. 
Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions. 
XXXX have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable. 
Remove outdated, negative information ( after XXXX years in most cases, XXXX in the case of bankruptcy ). 
I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate. 
They are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied I am in distress because of your mistakes. 
The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

I dispute the validity of this debt and am immediately requesting that you provide the following information : 1. The original contract binding me to this so-called debt. 2. The PAYMENT HISTORY with the original creditor and balance. 3. Copy of PROOF OF DEBT ASSIGNMENT. 4. Proof that I legally owe this debt to YOUR agency. 5. Proof that you are licensed and able to collect on this debt in my state. 6. The original PURCHASE AGREEMENT. A. THIS IS NOT ANY DEBT THAT I ORIGINATED MYSELF. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THIS DEBT ORIGINATED FROM. This inaccurate information needs to be re-investigated immediately by both the Credit reporting agencies and the furnishers of this information that is appearing on my consumer report. NOTE : As you can see within the screenshots that I have attached, Equifax removed this account 45 days ago. Please complete this file. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681e ( b ), A credit reporting agency must maintain accurate records at all times within the files of consumers. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681i, please perform an internal re-investigation on the validity of this account in question that is showing up on your consumer report under my name and notify me of your results within 30 days of your receipt of this letter and update my credit report accordingly to your findings. If you are unable to provide proof of my requests, then the erroneous information MUST be DELETED within 30 days of your receipt of this letter from my credit report as this erroneous account is very misleading and not mine. This account is causing me great mental anguish and I am unable to obtain a mortgage at this present time due to this inaccurate information on my credit report. Debt Collectors and Debt Buyers must furnish 100 % accurate information on consumers at all times. 15 USC 168s-2 Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information to Consumer Reporting Agencies ( a ) DUTY OF FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION ( 1 ) PROHIBITION ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. ( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors a person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. Please note that until the validity of this debt is verified, I demand that you CEASE all collection activities and CEASE REPORTING TO CREDIT BUREAUS IMMEDIATELY until complete and verified. Also, it is the duties of credit reporting agencies to uphold their grave responsibilities to supply 100 % accurate information ONLY on all consumer credit reports as the banking system itself hinges on accurate information. DELETE THIS ERRONEOUS INFORMATION from ALL credit bureaus immediately if the information can not be verified/validated.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE Account Numbers XXXX XXXX, This letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting my nonpublic and personal information without my written consent. Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party.

The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request.

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and Trans Union immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

My complaint is based on their failure to report accurate information in my consumer report. 

On XX/XX/year>, I mailed my dispute to TransUnion regarding inaccurate reporting of my car loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ). As of today, XX/XX/year>, it has been over 30 days, and I have yet to receive a satisfactory resolution. This inaccurate information has been present in my consumer report for over a year. 

I have maintained communication with XXXX  about the status of this account and possess all supporting documentation to substantiate my claims. Additionally, I have a transcript of my conversation with XXXX  confirming that my account was never reported as a charge-off. 

I would like to draw your attention to the following provisions of the FCRA that support my request : - **15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ** states that A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 
- **15 U.S. Code 1681e** mandates that Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of section 1681c of this title and to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b of this title.

It is my belief that TransUnion and other credit bureaus are not maintaining reasonable procedures as required by law. 

I kindly request your assistance in ensuring that this inaccurate account is removed from my consumer report. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 
The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and Trans Union immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

**Details of the Complaint : ** 1. **Dispute Closure** : On [ XXXX, XXXX ], I submitted a dispute regarding certain inaccuracies found in my credit report. On XXXX ], I received notice from Experian that my dispute was closed, and the information was verified as correct. 

2. **Subsequent Modifications** : However, I have recently observed that numerous modifications have been made to the disputed information in my credit report since it was closed. These modifications appear to be an attempt by Experian to contest its previous verification and to evade responsibility for the resulting harm and negligence that I have suffered due to the inaccuracies in my report.

3. **Investigative Requirements** : During this investigation, I stipulate that any continuing investigation into these items must include the disclosure of wet signatures and contracts associated with the accounts in question. If these documents can not be provided, I request that the account be removed from my credit report entirely as mandated by applicable regulations. 

4. **FCRA Violations** : The actions taken by Experian constitute violations of the FCRA, specifically in relation to the accuracy of information reported and the obligations surrounding the dispute process. The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate records, and the changes made following the closure of my dispute suggest a failure to uphold that standard.

5. **FDCPA Violations** : Additionally, these actions may also reflect violations of the FDCPA, as they may be construed as unfair practices that impact my personal and financial well-being. I believe that the modifications made in an attempt to mitigate liability for your previous negligence exhibit behavior contradictory to the ethical standards mandated by the FDCPA.

**Resolution Requested** : I request that Experian : - Immediately cease all modifications to my credit report that have been made post-dispute closure.

- Provide me with a comprehensive explanation for the alterations made to my credit report while noting the basis for their legitimacy.

- Conduct a thorough investigation that includes the disclosure of wet signatures and contracts associated with the accounts in question ; if these can not be provided, the account should be removed from my credit report.

- Provide correction of the inaccurate information, ensuring full compliance with both the FCRA and FDCPA.

- Compensate me for any damages incurred due to these violations.

Please treat this complaint with urgency and the seriousness it warrants. I expect acknowledgment of this letter within 15 days and a detailed response regarding the actions that will be taken to rectify this situation. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 
The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and Trans Union immediately.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I would like to file a formal complaint against Equifax and XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding their refusal to remove an inaccurate mortgage account from my credit report, despite both XXXX and XXXX having already done so. This unresolved issue has caused me significant stress and hardship, and I believe XXXX failure to remove the item is unjust and in violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

The mortgage account in question, XXXX XXXX, has been disputed for inaccuracy. Following my dispute, both XXXX and XXXX investigated the matter and promptly removed the item from my credit reports after determining it was indeed incorrect. However, despite my repeated requests and providing all necessary documentation, Equifax has yet to take the appropriate action and continues to report this erroneous information.

This prolonged inaction by Equifax has resulted in undue stress and has negatively impacted my ability to manage my credit. As an individual who has taken great care in maintaining responsible credit practices, the presence of this inaccurate item is unfairly damaging my credit profile. I believe it is only fair and reasonable that Equifax follows the same course of action as XXXX and XXXX and removes this item from my report immediately. 

I am requesting that the CFPB intervene and hold Equifax accountable for failing to resolve this dispute in a timely and fair manner. The resolution I seek is simple : the immediate removal of the XXXX XXXX  item from my Equifax credit report, as has been done by the other two credit reporting agencies.

I trust that the CFPB will investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure that Equifax complies with their obligations under federal law to provide accurate and fair reporting.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE Account Numbers- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, This letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting my nonpublic and personal information without my written consent. Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 

The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and Trans Union immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation.

Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 
The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and Trans Union immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation.

Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 
The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and Trans Union immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE Account Numbers XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, This letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting my nonpublic and personal information without my written consent. Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 
The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and Trans Union immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation.

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX failure to provide a response leaves me no choice but to assume that you have neglected to comply with FEDERAL law by not filing a 1099-C as mandated. Consequently, I am compelled to inform you that I will report XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to the IRS for potential tax fraud using Form 3949-A if prompt action is not taken. 

Furthermore, it is imperative that you notify XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX to delete this information from my credit report immediately. The account in question is detailed as follows : XXXX XXXXXXXX As per IRS regulations, a canceled debt of {$600.00} or more necessitates the filing of a 1099-C form by federal or government agencies, or applicable financial entities. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes tax fraud, a serious offense that I will not hesitate to report to the IRS. 

It is essential to understand that a canceled debt is considered ordinary income by the IRS. Consequently, any failure to file a 1099-C form, or any attempt to conceal such actions, constitutes inaccurate reporting. Income is not to be included on a credit report, and any such inclusion violates consumer laws and regulations. 

Your company 's actions are in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC 1681s-2, which outlines the responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies. Under this statute, it is prohibited to furnish inaccurate information knowingly or with reasonable cause to believe it is inaccurate. 

It is evident from my previous communication and this notice that there is reasonable cause to believe the information provided is inaccurate. Therefore, it is imperative that you take immediate steps to rectify this situation by deleting the inaccurate information from all consumer reporting agencies. 

Failure to comply will result in legal action being pursued, including holding the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, accountable for willful noncompliance under 15 USC 1681n ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). This statute stipulates that any person who willfully fails to comply with FCRA requirements may be liable for damages sustained by the consumer.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE : Late Payment Improperly Reported- I XXXX XXXX have a RIGHT TO PRIVACY under 15 USC 1681A ( 4 ) as a federally protected consumer and I know my rights presented under the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly outlined within 15 USC 1681. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So, whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent. I was reviewing my consumer reports and noticed XXXX XXXX on my credit report that need be immediately updated to paid as agreed. My Consumer rights have been violated by XXXX, XXXX, TransUnion. XXXX, XXXX, TransUnion has violated my consumer rights and violated federal law. This is now multiple attempts to notify you of this erroneous error on the part of your agency. This erroneous late payment is affecting my ability to obtain a loan to save my business from crumbling and also blocking me from the housing that I so desperately need for myself and my family. Please change this to paid as agreed immediately so that I may proceed with my life, or I may be forced to seek legal damages against your agency as I already have sought legal counsel in this more than important matter.

2024-10-19,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Seized or attempted to seize your property,"This is a follow-up to other complaints filed against XXXX XXXX for deceptive and fraudulent business practices and contains new information. 

Because of years of confusion, being bounced around to numerous people with XXXX XXXX, fabricated statements they made by me and more, I will put the most critical information in this complaint which will hopefully be my last one. 

As a result of errors by Bank of America and violations found, my loan modification ( from a previously predatory negative hybrid loan ) took XXXX  years to be rejected or approved. The loan modification was approved and went into effect on XX/XX/XXXX. 
During that time, in XXXX, my home was destroyed XXXX XXXX XXXX. The money that was paid out on the XXXX  was enough to rebuild in XXXX and has been sitting in an escrow account with XXXX XXXX and or Bank of America since the XXXX. But because of violations, errors and delays, the work did not start until XXXX, immediately after the loan modification was approved. XXXX XXXX XXXX of dollars of arrearages were tacked on to my loan modification as a result of years of their own violations, errors and delays. I was not given any other option if I wanted to keep my property. 

After the XXXX  inspection occurred in XXXX, XXXX XXXX stated only 3 % of the work was done. My contractor and I knew this was an error, disputed it but XXXX XXXX was again delaying, stalling and not communicating. Years later they changed that amount of work done to 10 %. In another inspection that percentage of work was then adjusted to 15 % and then ultimately on an inspection done on XX/XX/XXXX, with the added and corrected information which included the asbestos removal which was omitted in previous reports, the amount of work that was recorded ( which had been done in XXXX ) was actually 30 %. That inspection report was signed by the inspector and the witness who acknowledged all of this information and saw the actual inspection report that XXXX XXXX has withheld. This correct percentage of work was enough money to release more rebuild money which should have been done in XXXX. Because this did not occur, I had to stop making payments as there was no certificate of occupancy and no permanent power on the property. 

In a response to the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation by XXXX XXXX in XXXX, they falsely stated that I did not agree with that 30 % report. They falsely stated I contacted their loss draft department and scheduled a new inspection that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. This call and inspection never occurred. XXXX XXXX then falsified documents stating that an inspection occurred on XX/XX/XXXX bringing the amount of work done back down to 10 %. There are security cameras on the property and all inspections are done with a witness. There was no witness, there was no signed report and the security cameras showed no one on the property on that date. 

Because XXXX XXXX refused to provide the information requested about that alleged phone call and the signed inspection reports, in XXXX of XXXX I engaged an attorney to secure that information and those documents. XXXX XXXX bombarded my attorney with other documents that had nothing to do with what was requested including sending a decrypted email that had no valid wording on it the day before the last foreclosure sale date was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. My attorney sent an email advising of this and instructing them to not foreclose under these circumstances. My attorney was ignored and XXXX XXXX stated they proceeded with the Foreclosure auction. On XX/XX/XXXX, security cameras revealed people entering the locked gated property, climbing through the window of the studio which is occupied, rummaging through items and the mail and changing the locks on both the studio and the front gate. 

In the most recent communications to my attorney, XXXX XXXX stated the property is now bank owned and, over a year later, states that they are not required to provide the information we have requested and I have been requesting since last year. 

It is no secret that XXXX XXXX has a long reputation of deceptive and fraudulent business practices and this is among the worst. Another Law Firm asked if I would be willing to be the class action representative in one of the many lawsuits against XXXX XXXX and I did sign the retainer but after many discussions with the firm, discovered they do not handle individual matters which is why I retained another attorney to assist me. 

I trust this will finally be resolved and the fraud against me that has gone on for over 10 years will finally come to an end with restitution and a resolution making up for the damage done to my finances, my credit, my livelihood and my health.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",WA,982XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10512452

I have had exceptional payment history all payments were placed on Autopay. This late payment that is reporting is a result on a systematic error on their end processing my payment.

This was clearly a billing error made my the company and is not a reflection of my payment experience which violates USC Code 1681eb. This error has caused severe hard to my reputation, my character, my mode of living and to my family!

I demand the late payment to be updated.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 


XXXX XXXX TRANSUNION Never Sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE : Late Payment Improperly Reported- I XXXX XXXX have a RIGHT TO PRIVACY under 15 USC 1681A ( 4 ) as a federally protected consumer and I know my rights presented under the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly outlined within 15 USC 1681. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So, whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent. I was reviewing my consumer reports and noticed XXXX XXXX on my credit report that need be immediately updated to paid as agreed. My Consumer rights have been violated by XXXX, TransUnion, XXXX. XXXX, TransUnion, XXXX, has violated my consumer rights and violated federal law. This is now multiple attempts to notify you of this erroneous error on the part of your agency. This erroneous late payment is affecting my ability to obtain a loan to save my business from crumbling and also blocking me from the housing that I so desperately need for myself and my family. Please change this to paid as agreed immediately so that I may proceed with my life, or I may be forced to seek legal damages against your agency as I already have sought legal counsel in this more than important matter.

I wanted to share something that's been bothering me lately regarding my credit report. I recently checked it and found some inaccuracies that I need to address. 

There are several accounts listed that seem to be inconsistent, and its really confusing. Here are the accounts Im talking about : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX The problem is that theyre not reporting the information consistently. When I look at my credit profile, its clear that the details dont match up, which is super frustrating. This inconsistency could really affect my creditworthiness. 

I already wrote to the credit bureaus about these issues, but I havent heard back from them yet. Its been a bit of a hassle, and Im starting to get anxious about it. I just want to make sure everything is accurate!

I also referenced some sections of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) in my complaint to support my case. Specifically, I mentioned : - **Section 609 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) ** : This section requires the consumer reporting agency to provide consumers with the information in their file upon request.

- **Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) ** : This gives consumers the right to dispute inaccurate information and request an investigation.

- **Section 605 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) ** : This limits how long negative information can be reported, ensuring that inaccuracies are corrected promptly. 

Just wanted to vent a little and keep you in the loop. Please help if possible.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So, whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent.

Please change this to paid as agreed immediately so that I may proceed with my life, or I may be forced to seek legal damages against your agency as I already have sought legal counsel in this more than important matter.

Due to my health, I was unaware of these activities until my condition improved, at which point I began submitting disputes with both the creditors and credit bureaus.

Several creditors also confirmed that the transaction records are no longer available due to the age of the accounts and transfers to multiple parties. In other cases, creditors deleted the accounts without requiring further investigation based on the strength of the evidence. 

However, XXXX continues to report these fraudulent accounts. Despite having provided the FTC Identity Theft Report, proof of identity, and creditor deletion letters multiple times, XXXX refuses to delete these accounts, citing that I may have benefited from the transactions a baseless claim, especially since no transaction records have been provided to me, nor do the original creditors possess them. I have requested these transaction records from both XXXX and the creditors for over a year to no avail. 

XXXX 's implication that I benefited from these transactions, without providing any proof, is deeply harmful and unsupported by any evidence. Their failure to produce the transaction records or provide a detailed investigation contradicts their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE : Late Payment Improperly Reported- I XXXX XXXX have a RIGHT TO PRIVACY under 15 USC 1681A ( 4 ) as a federally protected consumer and I know my rights presented under the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly outlined within 15 USC 1681. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So, whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent. I was reviewing my consumer reports and noticed XXXX XXXX on my credit report that need be immediately updated to paid as agreed. My Consumer rights have been violated by XXXX, TransUnion, XXXX. XXXX, TransUnion, XXXX, has violated my consumer rights and violated federal law. This is now multiple attempts to notify you of this erroneous error on the part of your agency. This erroneous late payment is affecting my ability to obtain a loan to save my business from crumbling and also blocking me from the housing that I so desperately need for myself and my family. Please change this to paid as agreed immediately so that I may proceed with my life, or I may be forced to seek legal damages against your agency as I already have sought legal counsel in this more than important matter.

ubject : Immediate Demand for Deletion and Suppression of Fraudulent Information Due to Identity Theft To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to demand the immediate deletion and suppression of fraudulent information currently present in my credit file. As a victim of identity theft, I did not authorize or make the charges associated with the items listed in the enclosed report. This false information is damaging my credit report, and I require that it be corrected without delay. I reported the theft of my identity to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and have enclosed copies of the FTCs Identity Theft Affidavit as supporting evidence. Despite this, it has been over 30 days, and your agency is now in VIOLATION of federal law for failing to take the necessary action to correct my credit file. As per 15 U.S. Code 1681c2, a consumer reporting agency must block the reporting of any fraudulent information in the file of a consumer, identified as resulting from identity theft, no later than four days after receiving notice. This legal requirement has been ignored, and I demand that the fraudulent items be deleted and suppressed immediately. Your agency 's failure to comply with this statute and take swift corrective action is unacceptable. I expect full compliance with federal law and that my credit report be accurately updated within the next few days. If you continue to ignore this request, I will not hesitate to seek legal recourse to enforce my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

I have had exceptional payment history all payments were placed on Autopay. This late payment that is reporting is a result on a systematic error on their end processing my payment. 


This was clearly a billing error made my the company and is not a reflection of my payment experience which violates USC Code 1681eb. This error has caused severe hard to my reputation, my character, my mode of living and to my family!

I demand the late payment to be updated.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 


XXXX XXXX TRANSUNION Never Sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided. 


This is unfair, illegal, fraudulent, and not equitable to me as a consumer!

I did not open or authorize this account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I therefore request that it be closed immediately. I also request that they absolve me of all charges on the account, and that you take all appropriate steps to remove information about this account from my credit files. Enclosed is a copy of my Identity Theft Report supporting my position, and a copy of my credit report showing the fraudulent items related to your company that are the result of identity theft. Also enclosed is a copy of the FTC Notice to Furnishers of Information, which details your responsibilities as an information furnisher to credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ). As a furnisher, upon receipt of a consumers written request that encloses an Identity Theft Report, you are required to cease furnishing the information resulting from identity theft to any CRA. The Notice also specifies your responsibilities when you receive notice from a CRA, under section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, that information you provided to the CRA may be the result of identity theft. Those responsibilities include ceasing to provide the inaccurate information to any CRAs and ensuring that you do not attempt to sell or transfer the fraudulent debts to another party for collection. Please investigate this matter, close the account and absolve me of all charges, take the steps required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and send me a letter explaining your findings and actions. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Enclosures : Account applications made on paper, online, or by telephone Account statements or invoices Records of payment or charge slips Delivery addresses associated with the account Records of phone numbers used to activate or access the account Signatures on applications and accounts Investigators report Please send me a letter explaining what you have done to : Inform XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, debt is the result of identity theft Stop collection proceedings against me Stop reporting information about the debt to credit reporting companies Provide me with the records I request Thank you for your cooperation. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX All furnishers of consumer reports must comply with all applicable regulations, including regulations promulgated after this notice was rst prescribed in 2004. Information about applicable regulations currently in e ect can be found at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's website, consumer nance.gov/learnmore. NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION : OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is set forth in full at the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection 's website at consumer nance.gov/learnmore. A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-referenced to the U.S. Code is at the end of this document. Section 623 imposes the following duties : Accuracy Guidelines The banking and credit union regulators and the CFPB will promulgate guidelines and regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers. The regulations and guidelines issued by the CFPB will be available at consumer nance.gov/learnmore when they are issued. Section 623 ( e ). General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously speci es an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( C ). Duty to Correct and Update Information If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer If a consumer noti es a furnisher, at an address speci ed by the furnisher for such notices, that speci c information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ). If a consumer noti es a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ). The federal banking and credit union regulators and the CFPB will issue regulations that will identify when an information furnisher must investigate a dispute made directly to the furnisher by a consumer. Once these regulations are issued, furnishers must comply with them and complete an investigation within 30 days ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information ) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a credit repair organization. The CFPB regulations will be available at consumer nance.gov. Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ). Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer Reporting Agency If a CRA noti es a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information provided by the furnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The furnisher must : Conduct an investigation and review all relevant information provided by the CRA, including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ). Report the results to the CRA that referred the dispute, and, if the investigation establishes that the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain les on a nationwide basis. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( D ). Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section 623 ( b ) ( 2 ). Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ). Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ). Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to pro t or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer 's le. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ). Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to pro t or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ). Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to nationwide consumer reporting agencies, as de ned in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA. Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 1022, App. B. Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices ( and such furnisher 's agents or assignees ) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information. Duties when ID Theft Occurs All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to noti cations from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future.

2024-10-19,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I am filing a formal complaint against Equifax for their failure to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) regarding the investigation and verification of disputed items on my credit report. 

Details of the Complaint : Dispute Process Timeline : On XXXX XXXX XXXX I sent a formal dispute letter to Equifax demanding an investigation into several inaccurate accounts reported on my credit file ( Dispute ID : XXXX ). In this letter, I explicitly requested that Equifax exclude the use of third-party data sources and verify the information directly with the original creditors. 

Request for Identification and Delayed Response : After initially requesting that I provide identification ( which I promptly submitted ), Equifax delayed their response. The statutory investigation period expired without receiving any meaningful communication from them. 

Improper Verification of Accounts : On [ insert date of receipt ], I finally received a response from Equifax claiming that the accounts had been verified. However, Equifax has failed to provide adequate documentation or explain how they verified these accounts, as required under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ). No details on the methods or individuals involved in the verification process were disclosed. 

Violation of FCRA and Inaccurate Reporting : Equifax has continuously reported inaccurate and incomplete information on my credit report, including a charge-off for a XXXX XXXX XXXX account XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) which I had previously disputed as inaccurate. Their failure to remove this incorrect account after multiple disputes constitutes a violation of my rights under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) and 609 ( a ) ( 2 ). Furthermore, their use of third-party aggregators, instead of contacting original creditors directly, violates their statutory obligation to conduct a reasonable investigation.

Resolution Sought : I demand that Equifax : Immediately delete all inaccurate and unverifiable accounts from my credit report, including the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX account, and any related inquiries. 
Provide a detailed audit trail of their verification process for the disputed accounts, as required by law. 
Compensate me for damages caused by their failure to comply with FCRA requirements. 
Enclosed are copies of my previous correspondence with Equifax, proof of identification provided, and the response letter from Equifax received after the statutory deadline. 

I trust the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure Equifax complies with the FCRA and protects my rights as a consumer.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TX,77084,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10512870

2024-10-19,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"In XXXX of XXXX, I had multiple ( XXXX ) credit card accounts closed by Capital One. The accounts were closed due to multiple returned payments ; however, Capital One had previously, for years, provided an option to pay balances immediately using a debit card. This practice stopped in mid to late XXXX ( XXXX timeframe ). I personally contacted Capital One at this time and was informed that they no longer accepted any other form of payment aside from direct ACH from a checking account, which is not immediate and can take days to process depending on normal business hours and holidays. This change directly resulted in the loss of my ability to immediately pay outstanding debts with the instantaneous debit payment method that I had utilized for YEARS previously, which had resulted in an improved credit rating, and the ability to quickly pay down balances. Since two of the three Capital One cards were my oldest credit card accounts, they supported my credit history as my longest open accounts post-bankruptcy. After XX/XX/XXXX, and no longer being able to pay debts immediately with a debit card due to a change in Capital One policy, scheduled payments were not always processed immediately and at times resulted in a returned payment. As a result of only being allowed to submit ACH payments rather than immediate debit payments, my ability to fulfill these transactions were hindered. Additionally, although some payments were returned ( as they were more than the minimum required payment ), very importantly, I was still never late on any minimum required monthly payment for these cards. 

Regardless, without warning, Capital One abruptly closed all of my credit accounts, hindering my credit score and credit access. Insultingly, their prohibition on debit card payments seemed to have only been enforced during this difficult time from late XXXX until early XXXX, as it now seems that they are accepting debit card payments again. However, their 9 month hiatus directly negatively affected my ability to timely fulfill debt payments, and I was personally negatively affected by the impact of their decision to close my credit accounts, again without warning, after several years of a balanced relationship. 

My chief concern is that my ability to pay a debt immediately, a process that I was accustomed to for years thanks to the flexibility of their cards and debit payment system, was suddenly removed. And almost simultaneously, as all three of my credit accounts were closed by creditor without warning, XXXX of XXXX, the ability to pay via debit card suddenly reappeared. 

At the very least, the closing of the accounts after years of positive history shows a fear by the creditor, although the creditor directly removed the simplest form of payment and debt settlement. Only to months later, after filtering out customers such as myself who were credit challenged and paid religiously via debit card, bring back the simple, accessible payment method that I had used for years prior. 

It seems intentional, and it seems unfair. I would never have defaulted on any payment if it were directly deducted from my debit card, as it had been for years previously. Now, my credit rating has again been impacted, thanks to suddenly having to the door slammed in my face by a company that I once thought was an ally to extend credit to someone who was emerging from bankruptcy. They actually helped me get back on to my feet and re-establish my credit. Except for the fact that 9 years and 6 months in, they suddenly no longer had an interest in my money or business. 

I would appreciate an inquiry and explanation into Capital Ones brief hiatus of debit payments, their abrupt cancellation of extended credit, and the reemergence of the ability to pay via debit card. Im sure that they have covered their rear ends with pages of legalese that protects their rights to do so, but they have unfairly alienated groups of people by prohibiting them from fulfilling making payments in a traditional manner that was well established. 

I look forward to a response CFPB, as well as Capital One. At the very least, I would like my positive credit history and longevity accurately reflected within current credit reports. The unexpected closing of these accounts has severely impacted my length of credit history, and now negatively affects my ability to purchase a home, which was a huge possibility 6 months ago.

XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX  all reporting on my TransUnion credit report, dated XX/XX/XXXX. These banks made hard inquiries on my TransUnion credit report without my knowledge or consent, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which governs permissible purposes for credit inquiries. Under the FCRA, a creditor must have a legitimate purpose, such as my explicit authorization, a credit transaction initiated by me, or a court order, to access my credit report. I have not applied for credit or had any transactions with the aforementioned banks that would justify such inquiries. Their actions are in direct violation of my consumer rights. The following case law is relevant to my complaint : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) - in this case, the XXXX circuit ruled that the Fair Credit Reporting Act does not allow for a credit inquiry without a permissible purpose. The court held that accessing a consumers credit report without explicit authorization or a valid credit-related reason is an FCRA violation. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) - The XXXX Circuit ruled that companies that make unauthorized inquiries or do not have a valid reason for obtaining consumer reports can be held liable for violations of the FCRA, reinforcing the need for consent or a permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. 1681b. XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) - This case reaffirmed that unauthorized inquiries into a consumers credit history violate the FCRA, and the consumer is entitled to statutory damages and other relief if the inquiry was made without consent or legitimate reason. These hard inquiries have negatively impacted my credit score, and I believe I am entitled to relief, including the removal of these unauthorized inquiries from my credit report and any statutory damages as provided under the FCRA. I am requesting that the CFPB Investigate this matter and hold these institutions accountable for their unauthorized actions and furthermore, remove and delete these inquiries off of my TransUnion credit report. Please provide me with updates on the investigation and let me know if any further information is needed. Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter.

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I recently conducted a review of my credit report and found several items that have caused me significant distress. These items appear to be unverifiable, inaccurate, and questionable. Your agency has failed to ensure the accuracy of the information as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports. This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report.

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors. I have never entered into a valid contract with any of these entities, nor have I engaged in any transactions with them. As such, these accounts are fraudulent and may be the result of identity theft or other illegal activities. Attempting to enforce these fraudulent accounts is unlawful. I request that you expedite your investigation to prevent further harm, losses, or damages that I may suffer as a victim of identity theft.

Moreover, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, my right to privacy has been violated, and this breach infringes upon my rights as outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974.

Despite my submission of documentation to TransUnion as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, they have failed to block and remove adverse information from my credit file that directly resulted from my trafficking circumstances. This non-compliance violates my rights as outlined by federal law. 

I kindly urge the CFPB to take swift action to enforce the provisions of Section 605C and compel TransUnion to comply by removing all adverse information related to my trafficking experience. Additionally, I would like to highlight the following legal precedents and case laws which support my claim and further affirm TransUnions legal obligation to correct my credit file : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( Section 605C ) : This section clearly mandates that consumer reporting agencies must block adverse information in a consumers credit report when such information resulted from trafficking. 

XXXX XXXX TransUnion, LLC, XXXX. XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : In this case, the court reaffirmed that credit reporting agencies are required to comply with the FCRA and that failure to block inaccurate or misleading information constitutes a violation of federal law. 

XXXX XXXX. TransUnion, LLC, XXXX. XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : This case reinforced that trafficking survivors have rights to have adverse information resulting from trafficking removed or blocked from credit reports and that non-compliance with FCRA Section 605C opens the credit reporting agency to liability. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : The court held that consumer reporting agencies must investigate and block information in credit reports that is not attributable to the consumer, including instances where such adverse information resulted from illegal activities. 

TransUnions failure to remove the adverse information on my credit report is causing ongoing harm to my financial well-being, violating my rights, and perpetuating the impact of the trafficking I endured. I request that the CFPB enforces the statutory protections outlined in FCRA Section 605C, ensuring that TransUnion acts immediately to block and remove the erroneous information from my credit report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",OH,45431,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10508364

This incorrect information is adversely affecting my credit score, standing, and reputation. Under my rights outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681 ], I request that you conduct a reasonable investigation into this error and remove the following account from my credit report as it does not meet the standards of accuracy required by law : Account Name : XXXX XXXX  ( Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) The FCRA requires that you assure maximum possible accuracy of information in consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ]. This account, as listed, is inaccurately reported as a Collection/Chargeoff and contains erroneous information about the original creditor. Additionally, the account details indicate that this issue negatively impacts my creditworthiness, thereby causing undue harm in my efforts to secure financial stability and build my familys legacy. 
The following inaccuracies were found : Account Type : Collection Account Status : Derogatory Balance : {$1000.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Last Reported Date : XX/XX/XXXX Date Last Active : XX/XX/XXXX Payment Status : Collection/Chargeoff Legal Rights under FCRA : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, you are obligated to perform a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information within 30 days of receiving my request, and I expect a full investigation of this account to determine its accuracy. Furthermore, under 15 U.S.C. 1681c, any account involving collections must meet specific reporting standards, which I believe this account does not satisfy. 
If your investigation does not confirm the accuracy of this item, you are required to delete it from my file. I also request that any necessary changes be reported to all credit reporting agencies, including XXXX and XXXX, to reflect accurate data across all platforms. 
If the investigation does not result in deletion, I reserve the right to include a statement of dispute on my credit file, per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( b ), and to pursue additional remedies under the FCRA, including potential civil liability for willful noncompliance [ 15 U.S.C. 1681n ] and negligent noncompliance [ 15 U.S.C. 1681o ]. 
Please forward any written communication or updates regarding this matter to my address listed below.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consyumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,77017,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10512618

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX The problem is that theyre not reporting the information consistently. When I look at my credit profile, its clear that the details dont match up, which is super frustrating. This inconsistency could really affect my creditworthiness. 

I already wrote to the credit bureaus about these issues, but I havent heard back from them yet. Its been a bit of a hassle, and Im starting to get anxious about it. I just want to make sure everything is accurate!

I also referenced some sections of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) in my complaint to support my case. Specifically, I mentioned : - **Section 609 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) ** : This section requires the consumer reporting agency to provide consumers with the information in their file upon request.

- **Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) ** : This gives consumers the right to dispute inaccurate information and request an investigation.

- **Section 605 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) ** : This limits how long negative information can be reported, ensuring that inaccuracies are corrected promptly. 

Just wanted to vent a little and keep you in the loop. Please help if possible.

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 
YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. 
Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is, because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors I see, heres my breakdown : 1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act : Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable. Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven
years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate.

They are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied I am in distress because of your mistakes.

The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

2024-10-19,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I am filing a formal complaint against TransUnion for their failure to conduct a proper investigation of the items I disputed on my credit report and for not complying with my specific demands under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). TransUnion responded to my dispute claiming that the accounts in question had been verified, but they failed to provide any documentation or details about how the verification was conducted. 

Details of the Complaint : Dispute Filed with TransUnion : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a formal dispute ( Dispute ID : XXXX ) regarding multiple inaccuracies on my credit report, including late payments, charge-offs, and a collection account. I requested that TransUnion provide a comprehensive reinvestigation, including direct documentation of the verification process from the original creditors, as required by FCRA 609 ( a ) and 611 ( a ). I also specifically requested that no third-party aggregators, such as XXXX, be used during the reinvestigation. 

Inadequate Response from TransUnion : TransUnion responded to my dispute by stating that the accounts had been verified but did not provide any information on how the verification was conducted, as required under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ). I explicitly asked for documentation showing how each account was verified, including : The name and contact information of the original sources. 
The method used to verify each item. 
A detailed explanation of how TransUnion determined the accuracy of the reported information. 
TransUnion did not provide any of this information and instead gave a generic response stating the accounts were verified, which is insufficient under FCRA standards. 

Continued Inaccuracies in My Credit Report : The accounts I disputed, which include late payments, charge-offs, and a collection account, remain inaccurately reported on my credit report. I am requesting that these items be deleted immediately since TransUnion has failed to properly verify them in compliance with the FCRA. 

List of Disputed Items ( Previously Submitted to TransUnion ) : Late Payments : Accounts from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Charge-Offs : Accounts from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Collections : A collection account from XXXX XXXX related to XXXX XXXX. 
Violations of FCRA : TransUnion has violated t

he following provisions of the FCRA : 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) : Failing to provide me with the specific method of verification for the disputed accounts. 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Failing to conduct a reason
able investigation and verify the accuracy of the disputed information directly with the original creditors. 
Resolution Sought : I request that the CFPB take the following actions to ensure that TransUnion complies with the FCRA : Delete all inaccurate and unverifiable information from my credit report, including the disputed late payments, charge-offs, and collection accounts. 
Provide documentation of how each item was verified, including the original sources and methods used for verification. 
Ensure that TransUnion adheres to the FCRA 's standards for conducting a reasonable reinvestigation in all future disputes. 
Enclosed are copies of the dispute letters I sent to TransUnion, their inadequate response, and supporting documentation showing the inaccuracies that remain on my credit report. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received official notification that I was enrolled in the SAVE Plan and placed in forbearance until my payment amount could be calculated. Under this plan, I should not have been required to make payments or accrue interest during the forbearance period.

However, without any notification via email or mail, Mohela moved me to a standard payment plan on XX/XX/XXXX, requiring payments that were four times higher than my estimated SAVE Plan amount. I was not informed of this change in advance or given the opportunity to address the issue. I was also not able to sign online to review my account for months ; now that the website is working, I see that my account is past-due, and I've made several attempts to contact MOHELA via phone.

I should still be under SAVE Plan forbearance without accruing interest or being required to make payments until my repayment amount is properly determined.

I am requesting : Immediate reinstatement of my SAVE Plan forbearance status.

Correction of any accrued interest or past-due status caused by this error.

It was sent to my device and she knew my phone pin. So as of right now, its been about two months and I still haven't got the money back. Please help me.

Their in-app chat customer service agent told me that I was trying to purchase from a suspicious merchant. This was odd to me, considering that they had already done their due diligence by reaching out to me at the time of the initial attempt to confirm that the transaction was legitimate.

I took them at their word and waited a few hours before retrying as suggested. Upon retrying, the transaction still failed so I contacted their customer service department via phone. This time, I was given a completely different excuse. The customer service agent said that I was attempting to make a purchase which exceeded my daily limit.

After 30 days, your daily spending limit will be {$5000.00}, and {$1000.00} for an ATM withdrawal. If you have special circumstances and know you'll exceed this amount, call us
in advance at XXXX to set up a one-time, extended limit. '' I have been an Ally customer for well in excess of the 30-day timeframe mentioned in the excerpt above.

I persistently remained on the line, only to be told at the end of this hour-long phone call that I was not able to use the funds in my account to make the purchase that I was trying to make, but I should wait for "" a while '' before retrying again.

The agent returned with yet another alternate explanation. "" It wasn't Ally 's fault that the transaction is being blocked. It is XXXX. They have identified security risks with the merchant.

The loan originated in XXXX  with our first monthly installment auto-deducted on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ( all term payments are auto-deducted ). 

The monthly payments were fixed at {$82.00}, contingent on us as the borrowers reaching our 'target loan balance ' by the scheduled due date. My wife and I met the target loan balance several months ahead of schedule. The target loan balance was an accelerated paydown balance reached by applying the anticipated government-issued solar panel tax subsidy towards the outstanding principal loan balance. This Target Loan Balance and date can be seen on the Account Summary Page attached. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received our new billing statement from GL ( for our XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  payment ) and noticed the term payment increased to {$84.00} ( an increase of {$2.00} ). This was a large increase, but I called GL to understand what caused the increase as we are on a fixed-rate loan and we were well under our target loan balance. The rep agreed my payment should have increase due to those factors, but had no explanation for the increase. The rep took my contact info and stated they would have someone get a hold of me to explain the change and/or correct it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, GL management got involved and XXXX XXXX ( Loan Servicing Supervisor ) has sent me periodic emails stating they are working with their Investigations team to identify the issue - no results provided. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX stated they believe their Engineering team has identified the problem for the different payment amounts and are working on a solutions to resolve all loans affected - no results provided. The last email received from XXXX ( GL management ) was on XX/XX/XXXX stating they are still reviewing my account and expect a resolution shortly. 

This issue is not the increased amount itself, as it is marginal. The issue is GoodLeap management notated there is an issue, it has potentially affected more loans than mine, and there has been no resolution or explanation of the issue for over six months now.

If the extra {$2.00} being charge to my account every month is going towards our outstanding principal amount, that's fine. However, if the extra {$2.00} is some random glitch, or worse yet- some insidious scheme, and hundreds or thousands of borrowers are being overcharged, then there's a serious issue.

I called one day to try again to resolve the situation, and someone answered as XXXX. I knew it wasn't him - mannerisms and voice tone were different. I asked to be transferred to Accounts Pay to retrieve my money that was double-billed. XXXX ( whom i find later is the XXXX  ) answered and said, "" Thank you XXXX ''. I told her that XXXX impersonated and said he was XXXX. She acted surprised but now I know they all just play games. I filed reports with the Federal Trade Commission - FTC # XXXX and FTC # XXXX which I will be happy to give to whomever investigates this situation and the other many documents that back up my story which I was not able to include here. BarclayXXXX is a disgrace parading as a business. They are criminally negligent in their dealings with consumers. They won't even own up to their mistakes- which are too many to recall here. Instead they sent my disputes to be resolved with the 4 credit bureaus. I locked my card before I realized what had happened and tore up the card - and still because XXXX XXXX XXXX  had sold my information on the dark web - the card number was used to purchase some video thing - which I have no clue about. I disputed this charge but BarclayXXXX  is holding me responsible for this charge also. They would not close the card for me when I asked after I realized I had been double or rebilled. Finally one of the reps- whom are all VERY BACKWARD because of the company = finally closed the card and did a reissue which I have not activated. BarclayXXXX  has no record of when I locked the original card since was destroyed. Further on XX/XX/year>. I called and spoke with XXXX at BarclayXXXX customer service. I asked her about the dispute, and she said XXXX was unable to close it. I said that This is a blessing from XXXX, and told her to never close the dispute because I felt something shifty going on. ( But with BarclayXXXX you never receive a straight answer or the same answer twice in row. BarclayXXXX in their own way is as bad as XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
It is a no-win situation with both companies for consumers. Well, sure enough the two crooked companies rebilled this without my consent and without talking to me. What kind of business does this kind of stuff? There is NO CONFUSION. I knew exactly what they were doing and I did NOT agree to pay {$5200.00}. I have proven this with the information that I have provided After I had petitioned previously for my money to be refunded, Mr. XXXX XXXX called me on XX/XX/year> at XXXX XXXX. My husband XXXX XXXX XXXX and myself were on the call with MrXXXX XXXX. 
Mr. XXXX said he knows that he double-billed me the {$2600.00} plus the accruing interest but he said he would NOT refund my money. How crazy and brazen is this? I would never want to do business with this very crooked company again. I believe that this company is not even located in the United States. The XXXX XXXX XXXX  showing XXXX XXXX, CA, I believe to be a front company. They want to fleece the American public. The feeling I received from Mr. XXXX is that it is his RIGHT to do business in this fraudulent way and not correct the wrong. 
I reminded Mr. XXXX that XXXX XXXX impersonated the ex-employee XXXX XXXX to connive and defraud me of this money and that there are FTC reports noted above in this petition and this is a federal offense. 
Mr. XXXX said he knew that XXXX had done this and that Mr. XXXX was fired because of such = and that was supposed to satisfy me. Wrong! Mr. XXXX maintained that he will NOT refund this ill-begotten, fraudulently-obtained money, that Barclay assisted XXXX to steal from me. I think this is OUTRAGEOUS. Mr. XXXX KNOWS THIS IS WRONG AND WILL NOT CORRECT IT and REFUND MY MONEY. We argued with Mr. XXXX but he is intent on his theft. 
THE CFPB is supposed to protect the American public against such shams and fraudulent acts as this. I beg you all to do the RIGHT and CONSCIENABLE thing and REFUND MY MONEY now of {$2600.00} so this can be cleared from my exemplary credit record FOREVER.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,MO,630XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10511469

2024-10-19,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Confusing or misleading advertising about the credit card,"In late XXXX all four of my Chase XXXX XXXX had an offer of {$100.00} after spending {$500.00} or more booking through Chase travel online. 

I added the offers for all four cards planning to book flights and lodging for a trip next year. The offer was set to expire on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I used XXXX of the cards with the offers activated to make purchases online through Chase travel of {$500.00} ( XXXX ) and {$530.00} ( prime card XXXX ). Both of these honored the terms laid out on the offer details. 

On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I did not receive the credit yet and could not see the offer listed any longer on the two cards I used, so I called Chase Customer Service. The representative informed me that she did not see the offer on the cards at all. Fortunately, I screenshotted the offer for the Chase sapphire card to send to a friend and had it in my records. However, she did not see any such offer offered or activated on that card. I explained that I otherwise would not have booked through Chase travel if it were not for this offer. I was then transferred to Chase travel to get a refund for the two purchases totaling {$1000.00}, but they informed me it was too late to cancel without a penalty. 

I researched online and this is not the first instance of this occurring. It turns out other Chase customers have issues receiving credit for offers they have added, and the offers disappear before they are honored. 

Through a post documenting this by another customer, https : XXXX? XXXX I was able to call the XXXX XXXX office phone number. A representative reported that she saw that the offer on my sapphire card ( XXXX ) but that it was not offered or added to my prime Visa card ( XXXX ). I know this is not true because I double and triple checked before I booked that it was there even if I don't have a screenshot to prove it for the prime Visa card. In addition, on my chase online banking platform, both my sapphire card and prime XXXX card did not have the offer visible any longer, but my freedom and freedom unlimited continued to have the offer advertised since I did not use them yet. Why are the offers offered to all four cards I have and gone from the two cards I used the offer on? Of note, I made the huge mistake of being honest with her and telling her that I screenshotted the offer added to my card to a friend to inform him of the offer existing, and did not screenshot the one for my prime Visa card because I did not anticipate needing to do so for proof purposes. This was probably a convenient excuse to say the offer was never added since she knew I did not have proof for my prime card. 

I asked her to honor the credit from these two offers, but she said there was only proof that one was added when I know for a fact it was added to both. 

I believe the offer was a bait and switch to attract customers to book, and as soon as they are out of the window for a refund, the offers are removed from the card and the customer is gaslit into thinking they made a mistake and the offer was not present in the first place.Again, this is not the first time for this to happen ( see XXXX post linked above- as the customer did not screenshot his offer either, but it honored eventually after multiple complaints ). 

I have attached this offer in pictures below. 
These practices are shady for such a big credit card company and I would like them to be held accountable for future transactions. I also bank with XXXX XXXX and they usually send an email immediately after an offer is honored confirming eventual receipt of the credit. Chase has no such policy and it is based on trust which is obviously not warranted as seen in this deceptive situation of removing offers after the customer is already baited to book through their platform. 

Specific offer details are copied and pasted below.

2024-10-19,Debt collection,Other debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"I am writing to formally file a complaint and request assistance regarding an alleged debt being pursued by First Credit Services. Despite my repeated requests for validation and proof of the debt, First Credit Services has failed to provide sufficient documentation, and my consumer rights under federal law have been violated. 

Background of the Issue : On XX/XX/year>, I contacted First Credit Services via a written dispute, demanding validation of an alleged debt associated with [ Account Number, if available ]. I explicitly requested that First Credit Services provide documentation proving : That I owe the debt in question. 
That the original creditor had authorization to transfer or communicate the debt to First Credit Services. 
Despite this, First Credit Services has not provided adequate documentation to substantiate their claim and continues to pursue collection efforts and report this disputed debt to credit reporting agencies. This failure to provide sufficient proof violates federal consumer protection laws. 

Applicable Consumer Protection Laws : Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 U.S.C. 1692g Under this law, I have the right to request validation of the debt, and the collection agency must cease all collection activity until they provide sufficient documentation. However, First Credit Services has not fulfilled this obligation by failing to provide adequate proof of the debt.

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 This law requires data furnishers, like First Credit Services , to report accurate information to credit bureaus. Reporting an alleged debt without providing proper validation, especially after the debt has been disputed, constitutes a violation. The continued reporting of inaccurate information is negatively impacting my credit profile. 

Violations of My Rights : Failure to provide sufficient proof of the debt : First Credit Services has failed to meet the requirements under FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) by not providing the necessary validation of the alleged debt. This includes failure to provide sufficient documentation connecting me to the debt or substantiating the amount. 
Improper credit reporting : Despite the disputed status of the alleged debt, it continues to be reported on my credit report. This is a violation of the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), which mandates that only verified and accurate information be reported.

Failure to cease collection efforts : First Credit Services continues to pursue this debt without sufficient validation, in violation of FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ). 
What a Proper Debt Validation Investigation Entails : A proper debt validation investigation, as required by the FDCPA, includes : Review of Original Creditors Documentation : First Credit Services should have obtained records from the original creditor that prove the existence of the debt, such as a copy of the original agreement, contract, or billing statements. 
Breakdown of the Debt Amount : The collection agency is required to provide a clear, itemized breakdown of the total debt amount, including the original balance, interest, late fees, and other charges that apply.

Proof of Ownership and Transfer of the Debt : The agency must provide documentation proving that the debt was legally transferred or sold to them from the original creditor. This must include any assignment of debt paperwork or agreements showing the agencys right to collect the debt. 
Verification of Consumer Identity : Sufficient documentation should be provided that directly links the alleged debt to me, ensuring that the correct individual is being pursued for the correct amount. 
First Credit Services has failed to provide sufficient proof of the debt, as outlined above, and continues to pursue unlawful collection efforts without validation. 

Action Requested : I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to enforce compliance with the FDCPA and FCRA. Specifically, I request : That First Credit Services immediately cease all collection efforts until they provide sufficient proof and validation of the alleged debt. 
That they remove any negative information regarding this disputed debt from all credit reporting agencies until adequate validation is provided. 
That the CFPB require First Credit Services to conduct a thorough investigation of the debt, including obtaining proper documentation from the original creditor. This must include any assignment of debt paperwork or agreements showing the agencys right to collect the debt. 
That I be notified of the results of the CFPBs investigation and any actions taken against First Credit Services. 
I have enclosed copies of my prior correspondence with First Credit Services, including my debt validation request from XX/XX/year>. I hope that the CFPB will act swiftly to ensure that my rights as a consumer are upheld and that First Credit Services is held accountable for their violations.

This unresolved issue has caused me significant stress and hardship, and I believe XXXX failure to remove the item is unjust and in violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

The mortgage account in question, Freedom Mortgage, has been disputed for inaccuracy. Following my dispute, both XXXX and XXXX investigated the matter and promptly removed the item from my credit reports after determining it was indeed incorrect. However, despite my repeated requests and providing all necessary documentation, XXXX has yet to take the appropriate action and continues to report this erroneous information. 

This prolonged inaction by XXXX has resulted in undue stress and has negatively impacted my ability to manage my credit. As an individual who has taken great care in maintaining responsible credit practices, the presence of this inaccurate item is unfairly damaging my credit profile. I believe it is only fair and reasonable that XXXX follows the same course of action as XXXX and XXXX and removes this item from my report immediately. 

I am requesting that the CFPB intervene and hold XXXX accountable for failing to resolve this dispute in a timely and fair manner. The resolution I seek is simple : the immediate removal of the Freedom Mortgage item from my XXXX credit report, as has been done by the other two credit reporting agencies. 

I trust that the CFPB will investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure that XXXX complies with their obligations under federal law to provide accurate and fair reporting.

In addition to my XXXX XXXX XXXX, I depend on my vehicle as well so i may attempt to maintain my survival due to my multiple chronic illnesses, all if which, independently possess a daily and consistent threat to my survival. 
XX/XX/XXXX approximately I had came out to get my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  which were in my vehicle. Because I was unable to carry them all into the house, I thought my vehicle was stolen. I immediately called XXXX Police Department to report the stolen vehicle. They informed me that the car had been repossessed. Shocked because I am on XXXX as a XXXX person and have a extremely fixed income and my bills are mostly paid automatically to Toyota Financial Corporation and by my knowledge and the law being XXXX or if somehow I was in violation of a missed few payments, they have a duty of care and must provide me reasonable accommodation in which to take care of any financial obligations. Due to the severity of my illnesses, not only can I barely move, I have difficulty with communication, but that is why most of my bills are paid automatically as stress creates increased complications in my already deadly chronic illnesses which significantly compounds the risk of a fatal incident at any moment. I struggled with patience to inquire of the legality of the repossession. I have on video the tow truck which was all blacked out with no license plate or identification on the vehicle.I am severely limited in movement and motion which prevents me from being able to properly defend the illegal action. Nor was I contacted by Toyota saying I was in any type of financial deficit and as I inquired with XXXX Police Department, they informed me that it was in the possession of XXXX XXXX XXXX  located in XXXX, PA. I immediately called the recovery place XXXX XXXX and there was no answer and it was already beyond customer service time for Toyota Financial. So as I struggled through the night, I did have enough XXXX  in which to make it through the night, but I would not make it for the next day or so had I not been in contact with my doctors. But not only that, the severe detriment to my life caused by this illegal action because I live on private property and unless there is a judge or police escort, they can not come and take my property under XXXX compliance under reasonable combination. They must provide me with reasonable accommodations which includes adequate time for me with the health complications to set up a payment plan, adjust or defer payments in order to bring my account to current status, safely as to not cause any unnecessary injury or complications to my health also provide reasonable communication in which to allow me an opportunity to gather my items from the vehicle if that was the case. Since I have XXXX XXXX and XXXX  in the vehicle, as well as other sensitive medications i am required to have with me at all times, not only for my daily survival but the legal requirement to secure and retrieve my medical prescriptions and medical equipment so no one else 's health, safety and well-being can be affected. This is very time sensitive. It can't just be sitting in the vehicle under heat and unattended and rummaged thru for valuables, resale or additional unsafe storage practices that is documented repeatedly in this industry. Without my wallet and payment cards, I am unable to make purchases for the most part, nor can I go get them. My bank, XXXX XXXX, denied me the opportunity to get a replacement debit card because they required a valid driver 's license, which I did not have because I did not have my vehicle. I do not have any assistance or friends in which to call upon for an immediate resolution or attempt to gather my belongings and as according to consumer law. I contacted both XXXX XXXX XXXX and Toyota Financial twice in order to alert them of the situation and come to a healthy, safe and reasonable accommodation. Not only was I treated very rudely and aggressively by both companies, I was hung up on as well, twice by XXXX XXXX XXXX and twice by Total Financial. I find this disturbing and dangerously life threatening because this is direct attack on my life, attempted murder. Because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  is so deadly, it requires constant vigilance for me to maintain my already dangerous XXXX XXXX as well as having XXXX other chronic illnesses, each independently are capable taking my life every day. The additional stress of the situation exacerbates those chronic conditions immensely and under the law, not my personal opinion, the law requires them to abide by consumer law, engage in fair business practices, refrain from malicious and aggressive tactics, that threaten, endanger or violate unalienable civil, constitutional, human rights as well as discrimate XXXX. Meaning they should have brought my vehicle back. And due to the sensitive nature of the medicines inside my vehicle, I am very, very nervous and distraught that the processes of this recovery agent, company and all other unknown actors they are associated with. Because i never gave authorization for any of my personal information to be distributed to any entity and the industry in general. Not only is that a breach of contract. It puts me, my neighbors and my community at risk of harm. And knowing that someone will be rummaging through my car, whether to search for valuables or to enter the vehicle maliciously. To empty it without practicing legal, safe, and sanitized medical protocols requured for proper handling and storage of life saving meditation and equipment without contamination is unacceptable. They are holding my life for ransom and every resource I have reached out to has just told me to call a lawyer or call advocacy group. As a human being, not only XXXX person, I should not have a crime committed against me and then be forced to wait for the legal system to attempt to figure things out.

Consumer law requires that any repossession or attempt to reclaim a debt can not breach the peace they can not threaten or caused distress in order to acquire greater income to which a person normally can not or may not be able to provide. But as a XXXX person, I depend on my XXXX XXXX XXXX of my vehicle to get to my multiple doctors as well as stay compliant for XXXX, but most importantly to stay alive. This is a human rights violation, a civil rights violation, constitutional violation anf XXXX discrimination. This must be resolved and answered for immediately as every single minute goes by of my worry and my stress of my life saving medication and my personal belongings being taken or maliciously used and could cause harm to others is an immediate and present danger and threat that must be addressed. I require my immediate return of my vehicle by the recovery business and Toyota Financial, undamaged. and I require that inventory be taken by myself to account for any missing items or damage. Any refusal to do this is a violation of assault and battery, trespassing, on top of a violation of a contract which would make Toyota Financial as well as XXXX XXXX XXXX fully responsible for any damages and personal injuries that I have suffered, both emotional distress and physical duress. This violation is causing such life threatening health complications, that while i was filing a complaint with another state agency regarding this issue it caused a XXXX XXXX XXXX exceeding XXXXanything over XXXX can cause a fatal event such as a XXXX, which was so dire, that the agency IMMEDIATELY called 911 and police and emergency medical teams were dispatched to my location.

This case involved unauthorized alterations and duplication of a vehicle lease agreement that was fraudulently signed in our names. 

Incident Description : On XX/XX/year>, my wife and I entered into a vehicle lease agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Without our knowledge or consent, a second fraudulent contract was created by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year>, which included terms we never agreed to. This fraud was only discovered at the end of the lease term due to additional unexpected fees being charged. 

Discovery and Subsequent Actions : Upon discovering the forgery, we filed a police report with the XXXX, Arizona Police Department, which was forwarded to the XXXX Police in California. However, this case was not pursued due to other ongoing police priorities. We also reported this incident to the XXXX Investigations Department, who confirmed the fraud but did not press charges due to the lack of an eyewitness. 

Additionally, we filed a fraud claim with Acura/Honda Financial , who after their investigation, confirmed the contract was fraudulent and removed the associated credit line from our credit reports. Unfortunately, this action resulted in a significant drop of over XXXX points in my credit score, further compounding the financial damage we have suffered. This significant drop impaired my ability to purchase another vehicle and caused my insurance cost to rise significantly. Importantly, Acura/Honda Financial has declined to refund any payments made under the fraudulent contract. 

Advers Action by Honda/Acura Financial : While we were actively seeking resolution, Acura/Honda Financial proceeded to repossess the vehicle, exacerbating the situation and leaving us without a critical means of transportation since we are a one vehicle household.

We trust the CFPB will take immediate action on this matter, which not only involves financial exploitation but also significant distress and damage to our financial standing.

2024-10-19,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Edfinancial services are trying to demand I pay back {$4700.00} plus interest because they "" sent a duplicate refund '' by accident a year and a half ago. When I was going to beauty school in XXXX, I had no choice but to take out a loan of {$9000.00} to make tuition, which I paid off by the end of my school year. After I graduated, XXXX XXXX school took out another loan with edfinancial services of {$670.00} without my consent. I filed a dispute with XXXX XXXX XXXX  to which the loan was put on forbearance until XXXX while the investigation was going on. Last year of XXXX, the case was settled and I received forgiveness for that. I also received a letter in the mail stating I would be getting a refund back based on my claim. So at this point I owed nothing and I received a refund in full for what I paid for back when I was going to school thanks to the loan forgiveness and my claim. Today XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from edfinancial services and an email right after stating I need to check my inbox. Upon signing in, I immediately noticed the late payments and the amount the website was claiming I owed. I called edfinancial services to which they pointed me to the inbox on their website. On XX/XX/XXXX, they have sent me a letter on their website stating that they sent a duplicate refund of {$4700.00} and they want me to pay it back. The charges I have pending on the website add up to {$4900.00} because they have already started charging me for their payment plan plus interest. I had no idea where this came from or why, a year and a half later. I am in disbelief. I have other inbox notifications from them on their website. XX/XX/XXXX, they sent a letter showing I have loans that needs to be paid. It's the same loans that I disputed back when I finished school but they added more money on top of it to add up to {$4700.00}. It also stated that I wouldn't need to make a payment until XXXX and they are putting me on a payment plan of {$50.00} a month. On XX/XX/XXXX, they sent a letter titled "" 11 day delinquency notice '' saying that I am XXXX or more days past due on paying back that loan of {$4700.00}. On that same day, XX/XX/XXXX, they sent out another letter showing a billing statement which shows that I am 2 months late for paying them back and I now owe them {$100.00}. Which is weird because in the inbox from their site, I received those 3 letters back to back in one month ; two on the same day. On XXXX XXXX, on their edfinancial website inbox, I received a letter of "" delinquency '' stating that I am XXXX or more days past due for paying them back. On that same day, XXXX XXXX, I received another letter on their site with another billing statement showing that I need to make a payment of {$150.00}. Today, XXXX XXXX, I received a call from an unknown number, which I don't answer unknown numbers due to scam likely calls. I received an email from edfinancial services right after saying I need to check my edfinancial account but a warning for possible scam. I decided to put the number that called into XXXX and it turned out to be edfinancial services calling, so I logged into the website. Only once on the phone, the customer service representative told me that I should check my edfinancial inbox. When I did, I noticed a letter which was received that same day, XXXX XXXX, stating the refund error on their part but that I have to send back the refund. The refund that I did not know I had to send back which is also starting to grow interest. I also received no warning for it yet it is showing as a loan and only today was I notified about it being a "" duplicate refund '' that needs to be sent back. On my student aid account, I have no pending loans. Everything is paid off and forgiven. Yet on edfinancial services they are insisting a loan needs to be paid back. Now, this was a year and a half ago that I received said refund. I am broke and unemployed, living with my mom. That money was used to help with rent and other living expenses. I do not have the money that they are demanding back with Interest. I also do not appreciate that they are trying to just dump this responsibility on me last minute with no warning. As you can see, they sent me a notice only on their website then right after another stating that I was already past due for said payments, which I don't understand how that's possible. I would like to know if it is possible to investigate this because to me it seems pretty sketchy. This is also not my fault that they made a mistake a year and a half ago. I don't think it's right that I have to be responsible for their mistake. I am broke and unemployed so there is no way that I could afford this right now and it came out of the blue from my knowledge. 
At the end of the call with Edfinancial services, they told me I would need to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX to file a dispute. I talked to 3 Edfinancial Service customer service representatives who did not fully understand my problem and insisted that I had to pay back this "" duplicate refund ''. The last representative encouraged me to call XXXX XXXX XXXX to see if I can make a dispute. While on the phone with XXXX XXXX XXXX, the customer service representative was so confused on why I was being charged because it shows on my account that I have no pending loans and everything was paid off or forgiven. The Federal Student Aid customer representative then connected me with a supervisor who was also confused on my situation and insisted that I make a complaint on Federal Student Aid website to make a dispute against what it happening. The supervisor also stated that they have never seen this type of situation before. 
I have made the claim on the Federal Student Aid website and I am also making a claim on CFPB as well to help resolve this sketchy situation.",,EdFinancial Services,NY,11236,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10512803

Please show me the proof you sent me giving me options on how I could opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and proof showing you gave me the option to not disclose my transaction history each month with a third party. 
The law states a consumer must give written consent to opt out of sharing their nonpublic information to the financial institution. I did this and you stated I did not have that right to opt out. It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request. 

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation.

In fact there is nothing PROMOTIONAL about the Fixed Payment Reduced APR Plan. Upon using it, it immediately charges the consumer compounding interest of 18.90 %. Not what someone thinks about when they think about a promotion. 
The alleged promotion here is NOT charging 32.99 % interest. 

Upon reading the statement, and terms of conditions, it appears that there is particular attempt to use language in a way specifically so to make it confusing. Promotional is used to describe multiple different variables, "" Promotional Balance '' "" Promotional Expiration Date '' "" Promotional Purchase '' Also referring to the APR Plan as a "" Fixed Payment '' plan, it gives the implication of no interest, despite this not being a fixed payment plan. 

The statement describes the promotional balance of each plan like this "" YOU MUST PAY EACH PROMOTIONAL BALANCE IN FULL BY ITS EXPIRATION DATE TO AVOID PAYING DEFERRED INTEREST CHARGES. PLEASE SEE THE PROMOTIONAL PURCHASE SUMMARY SECTION ON THIS STATEMENT FOR FURTHER DETAILS. YOU HAVE A PROMOTION ( XXXX ) EXPIRING ON XX/XX/XXXX. '' When it says 'you must pay each promotiona balance in full by its expiration date ' for the Fixed Payment Reduced APR Plan it is saying you must pay off the entire loan immediately to avoid interest.

2024-10-19,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Repossession,Loan balance remaining after the vehicle is repossessed and sold,"In XXXX, at XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was manipulated into accepting a predatory auto loan from Westlake Financial. The terms of the loan were abusive from the start, with an extortionate XXXX XXXX interest rate. I was coerced into this loan with minimal transparency about the long-term financial harm it would cause. This loan should never have been approved for someone in my financial position at the time. 

Over the course of this loan, I have paid Westlake Financial over {$12000.00}, yet they still repossessed my car and are now demanding an additional {$1500.00} to retrieve it. The car is in poor condition, damaged, and not even worth the amount they are asking for. They are holding the vehicle ransom with absurd charges that far exceed its value, all while exploiting consumers like me with their unethical loan practices. 

Westlake Financial is notorious for taking advantage of vulnerable individuals with predatory interest rates and loan terms designed to trap people in debt. I believe this company is engaging in unethical and potentially illegal lending practices. Their business model seems focused on extracting every possible dollar from customers, regardless of the customers ability to pay or the vehicles actual worth. 

This situation has caused extreme financial XXXX, and I can no longer afford to be held hostage by their outrageous demands. I am filing this complaint in hopes of preventing further exploitation of others and seeking immediate relief from this debt. I request a full investigation into Westlake Financials lending practices and demand that this predatory behavior be stopped.

2024-10-19,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX*Introduction and Summary of Complaint** I am filing this complaint against **Zwicker & Associates** , a debt collection firm representing XXXX XXXX, concerning their attempts to collect an alleged debt that I dispute. This debt may stem from **identity theft**, as I have been a victim of fraud **over five times in the past two years**. **Zwicker & Associates** has failed to validate the debt as required under the **Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) **, failed to provide accommodations under the **Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) **, and misrepresented their role in collecting the debt, claiming they are merely representing XXXXXXXX XXXX* and do not own the debt. 

Furthermore, as a law firm representing a creditor, **Zwicker & Associates** must adhere to strict legal standards for proving their right to collect on a debt. They must provide comprehensive, verifiable evidence similar to what would be required in court, including documents that establish their standing to collect, proof of the debts existence, and authorization to act on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I demand that **Zwicker & Associates** provide the following **court-required evidence** before any further collection attempts. 

-XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXFactual Background** 1. **Disputed Debt & Identity Theft History** I dispute the debt **Zwicker & Associates** claims I owe to XXXX XXXX. Given my history of **identity theft**, where my personal information has been stolen **five times in the past two years**, it is possible that this alleged debt is fraudulent. **Zwicker & Associates** must provide sufficient documentation to prove that the debt is valid and that they have the legal right to collect it, as required by the **FDCPA**. 

2. **Claimed Mailings & Lack of Proof of Delivery** **Zwicker & Associates** asserts they sent me the **debt verification notice** as mandated by **FDCPA Section 809 ( a ) **. However, I have not received such a notice. I demand that **Zwicker & Associates** provide **certified mail receipts**, **tracking numbers**, or other verifiable proof that they sent the debt verification notice and that I received it. Without this proof, their claims of having sent the notice are invalid. 

3. **Failure to Acknowledge Disability Accommodation Requests** I have made **seven requests** for reasonable accommodations under the **ADA** due to my XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, but **Zwicker & Associates** has failed to provide any accommodations to facilitate communication . This is a clear violation of the **ADA** and prevents me from fully engaging in resolving the alleged debt. 

-- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX **Legal Violations** 1. **FDCPA Violations** - **Section 809 ( b ) ** : **Zwicker & Associates** has failed to cease collection efforts after I disputed the debt. They are required by law to provide proper verification before continuing any collection attempts.

- **Section 809 ( a ) ** : As part of the **FDCPA**, debt collectors are required to send an initial written notice. **Zwicker & Associates** claims to have sent this notice, but they have failed to provide verifiable proof of receipt.

- **Section 807 ( 2 ) ( A ) ** : Their claim of having mailed the verification notice without providing evidence of delivery is misleading and violates the **FDCPA**. 

XXXX. **ADA Violations** Under the **ADA**, **Zwicker & Associates** is required to provide reasonable accommodations for my XXXX XXXX XXXX*, which they have failed to do, preventing me from understanding and responding to their communications. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXhallenge to Zwicker & Associates ' Defense** **Zwicker & Associates** has defended its actions by asserting they are merely representing XXXX XXXXXXXX and do not own the debt. This argument is legally irrelevant to their responsibilities under the **FDCPA**. Regardless of ownership, the **FDCPA** requires them to provide verification and evidence of the debt 's validity. 

- **FDCPA Responsibility Regardless of Ownership** : The **FDCPA** requires debt collectors, whether they own the debt or are acting as agents, to substantiate their claim that they are authorized to collect and to provide proper documentation proving the debt exists. This includes providing evidence similar to what would be required in court. 

-- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  **Evidence Zwicker & Associates Must Provide** As a law firm, **Zwicker & Associates** must provide all the following evidence to validate the debt, as if they were preparing for litigation : 1. **Original Creditor Documentation** - A copy of the **original loan agreement** or **credit card agreement** with XXXX XXXX, showing the amount, terms , and signatures ( if applicable ). 
- **Statements** or other documentation showing the debt in question, such as the **transaction history**, and the last payment made. 

2. **Proof of Assignment or Authorization to Collect** - Documentation showing that **Zwicker & Associates** has been **authorized** by XXXX XXXX to collect the debt, including any **assignment agreements** or **agency agreements** that provide them the legal right to collect on the debt. If they are not the creditor, this is crucial. 

3. **Proof of Debt** - **Account statements** from XXXX XXXX or other supporting documents that clearly show the amount of the debt and that the debt belongs to me. This should include a **clear breakdown of the balance** owed, including interest, fees, and principal. 

4. **Proof of Debt Validation** - A **signed affidavit** or **certification** from someone with **personal knowledge** of the account confirming that the debt is mine, the amount is accurate, and that **Zwicker & Associates** has the right to collect. This affidavit must meet the requirements of evidence used in court.

5. **Proof of Debt Verification Mailing** - **Certified mail receipts** or **tracking numbers** proving that the **debt validation notice** was sent to my correct address. If they claim they mailed this notice, they must substantiate that claim with **evidence of receipt** or a **certificate of mailing**. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  **Requested Relief** 1. **Debt Validation** : Direct **Zwicker & Associates** to provide the required documentation proving the debt, including the original loan agreement, transaction history, and proof of their right to collect on behalf of *XXXX XXXX 

2. **Proof of Mail Delivery** : Require **Zwicker & Associates** to provide verifiable proof ( e.g., certified mail receipts or tracking numbers ) that they mailed the debt verification notice and that I received it. 
3. **Cease All Collection Efforts** : Until **Zwicker & Associates** provides valid proof of the debt and verification mailing, I request that all collection efforts cease in compliance with **FDCPA Section 809 ( b ) **.

4. **Reasonable Accommodations** : Direct **Zwicker & Associates** to provide reasonable accommodations for my *XXXX XXXX XXXX  in compliance with the **ADA**. 

5. **Investigation and Enforcement** : Investigate **Zwicker & Associates** for violations of the **FDCPA** and **ADA**, and enforce corrective actions where applicable.

-- - # # # **Conclusion** Given my history of **identity theft** and **Zwicker & Associates'** failure to provide the necessary documentation to substantiate their claim, I request immediate intervention by the **CFPB**. Their defense of merely representing XXXX XXXX does not exempt them from following the **FDCPA** or **ADA** requirements. **Zwicker & Associates** must be held accountable for their actions and ensure full compliance with consumer protection and disability rights laws. I demand that they provide all evidence that would be required in court, including the original debt documentation, proof of assignment, and verification of the debt, before continuing any collection efforts.",,ZWICKER & ASSOCIATES,NJ,08742,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10513141

Unfortunately, the ATM malfunctioned during the transaction, resulting in the loss of my funds without depositing them into my account. 

Specifically, during the deposit process, the ATM made a pop sound, instructed me to remove my card, but did not return my funds. The ATM did not print an error slip either. My friend, who was with me at the time, witnessed the incident and heard me exclaim that the ATM had eaten my money. I waited for the machine to return the funds, but it subsequently shut down and entered maintenance mode. I could hear the sound of my money being shuffled and counted by the machine before it went offline. 

When the ATM came back online, I printed a balance statement, which confirmed that my account did not reflect the deposited funds. I immediately returned to the Fifth Third branch where the ATM was located and reported the incident to the branch manager. The manager called the disputes department on my behalf, and I was issued a temporary credit onXXXX XXXX XXXX  as an investigation was initiated.

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I noticed that the temporary credit had been reversed. When I contacted Fifth Third Bank, I was informed that the investigation had been closed, and the bank concluded that the ATM did not malfunction. I requested that they review the ATM footage, as it would clearly show me depositing the funds and the machine going into maintenance mode. However, the representative I spoke to refused to reopen the investigation and denied my request to return my funds. 

After a heated exchange, the representative reopened the case but refused to reissue the credit. That same day, I returned to the branch, where the manager contacted the disputes department once again and provided me with a case number. Despite these efforts, it has now been nearly two months, and I have not received my funds or any meaningful assistance from the bank. 

This experience has been extremely frustrating, and Fifth Third Banks lack of responsiveness and accountability has caused significant inconvenience. I am requesting your assistance in resolving this matter. I would appreciate it if you could intervene to ensure that Fifth Third Bank reviews the ATM footage, reopens the investigation in good faith, and returns the funds that were lost during the malfunction. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.",,FIFTH THIRD FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,34135,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10497220

On XXXX XXXX XXXX I was once  again contacted about this account. No one had given me a name for the company contacting. However this time they had my full ssn, and some public information ( my address, and information on the truck I have recently bought ). They told me US Bank was going through litigations and getting paperwork to sue me over an overdraft on that account. It was not overdrafted, because I distinctly remember being embarrassed when the teller was closing my bank account and asked if I was like to keep the XXXX that was still in my account. I then hung up the phone on who I believed was a scammer.

2024-10-19,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction problem,,"I opened a new account with Chase Bank here recently, I opened a checking and savings account. I have had a checking and savings account with XXXX XXXX  for years and closed my accounts with them on XXXX XXXX XXXX to transfer to Chase bank. Whenever I closed my accounts with XXXX XXXX I transferred all of my money that was in those accounts to my Chase checking account before I closed my XXXX XXXX  accounts. I made sure that both of my accounts was at a XXXX balance before they closed and I also made sure that the full amount of the funds I had from my XXXXXXXX XXXX  both checking and savings accounts got deposited into my Chase account before I closed them. I would not have closed my account if any kind of money was not transferred over. It was a total of {$2100.00} that I had. I transferred them between bank accounts, from XXXX XXXX  to Chase Bank, I made XXXX {$1000.00} dollar transaction and XXXX {$500.00} dollar transactions. They were deposited immediately into my Chase checking and I transferred them back into my savings because thats where they came from. But after a few days I seen Chase had put XXXX {$500.00} transaction on hold. They didnt tell me why, it just said it would be available on the XXXX. It was deposited on the XXXX and was in my available balance. When I checked my account this morning it had been returned to XXXX XXXX due to insufficient funds. Even though that bank account is closed and has a {$0.00} balance, its not going to be returned. They had already received the money on the XXXX because it was in my account. Im not sure why after they received it that they would put it on hold and then try and send it back trying to say the money was never in my account because when they tried to pull it it wasnt there. I have no idea why they would try and take it out again knowing that the account it came from it closed but also, they had already received it initially on the XXXX when I made the transfer. I called and spoke to both Chase and XXXX XXXX  for several, several hours today trying to resolve this and nothing got resolved. They told me that the {$500.00} dollar transaction was an ACH transfer so it did not get processed until days later when my accounts was already closed with a XXXX balance, but when I transferred the {$2100.00} to my Chase account it showed up immediately and left my XXXX XXXX account at {$0.00} so I closed my account. My {$2100.00} dollars was in my chase account on the XXXX when I made the final transfers and closed my XXXX XXXX  accounts. Neither Chase or XXXX XXXX is saying anything about giving me my money back they are saying it was never there to begin with but the {$2100.00} is in my account currently, minus the {$500.00} that they are saying was never in there. I asked to speak with managers, and several different departments many times throughout the calls with each bank. Nobody was any help and said that I never had the money to begin with. I dealt with this for about XXXX hours today on the phone back and forth and havent gotten anything resolved. They are not understanding that my account statement literally shows where the deposits were made on the XXXX that equaled {$2100.00} but Chase does not see XXXX of the {$500.00} deposits, they only see a {$1000.00} dollar deposit and XXXX {$500.00} dollar deposit. And I continued to say that there is another {$500.00} deposit that I see on my statement that shows it was in my account and yall dont see that and now thats the transaction that is missing and I dont know what to do because I feel like I am getting screwed out of {$500.00} dollars and that isnt small change, that is a big deal and it would hurt me financially a lot and I dont understand why this has been so difficult or why neither of these banks have been any help at all in giving me back what was rightfully mine to begin with. 

I am attaching a screenshot of the transaction that Chase said they did not see. It was the transfer that said online transfer from XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX with the transaction number. They see the other XXXX transactions for {$1000.00} and {$500.00} but that specific transaction that says online transfer from XXXX XXXX is the one that they dont see and that is missing.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TN,373XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10512742

The funds were deposited into my accounts but now Chase is closing my accounts and is refusing to release the funds because they were unable to verify the checks. I called them everyday for XXXX weeks to try and prevent them from closing my account and they asked me for numbers because the number associated with the checks in their system was not picking up. I provided them several different numbers, but they refused to call any of them and told me none of the numbers provided were verified. I got all the numbers from the company 's lawyer, including the number of the person who signed the checks that I deposited. No one from Chase has called these numbers despite them asking me to find them. They say they are not verified and that unless I can provide a verified number my account will be closed. As of today both my checking and savings are closed and Chase is holding on to the funds. They are calling one number that is associated with the checks in their system through the CA Secretary of State, is what I was told, but it has been nearly XXXX weeks and no one is picking up from that number. They want me to get someone to pick up from that number or get another number. I am stuck because no one at Chase is calling numbers they asked me to get for them in order to verify these checks. The other party in the lawsuit confirmed that the funds left their bank and are in my account, Chase is just not letting me access it and is not giving me a solution. To top it off Chase has been extremely rude and they keep moving the finish line. I have been calling them constantly and I have broken into tears several times. One manager told me over the phone crying was not going to help my case. On Tuesday I went into a branch, they called the other party in the lawsuits lawyer and verified the checks and I was told my accounts would be reopened. However, now my accounts are closed and they are holding on to the funds. Several times I have been told that the lawyers number worked to verify the checks and to call back the next day to check my account is re-open and when I check back in they ask me for another number because now the lawyers number doesnt work. I was also told the number for the man who signed the check would work and when I got that for them, they said it didnt actually work.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,WA,98105,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10509980

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am writing to formally file a complaint against Self Financial , Inc. ( Self ), regarding inaccurate information reported on my consumer report. I believe these inaccuracies violate my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and potentially relevant state laws. Below are the specific issues : 1. Incorrect Account Opening Date Self Financial has inaccurately reported the opening date of my account as XX/XX/year>. This information is incorrect, and the actual account opening date is different. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 609 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ), I have the right to accurate information on my consumer report, and any incorrect dates or information should be promptly corrected.

2. Reporting of Late Payments Self Financial has reported that I made late payments on my account. This is inaccurate as I have consistently made timely payments. According to the FCRA 623 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), furnishers of information to credit reporting agencies are required to report accurate and complete information. The reporting of late payments that were never made is not only misleading but damages my credit standing. 

3. XXXX Payments on Account Despite High Balance Self Financial is reporting a high balance on my account but is simultaneously showing XXXX payments made. This is inconsistent and inaccurate. Under FCRA 623, furnishers must ensure that the information provided is correct, and reporting both a high balance and zero payments when payments were made does not comply with this requirement. This erroneous information could mislead creditors and negatively impact my creditworthiness. 

Violations of Federal and State Laws Under the FCRA, consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate information, and companies must investigate and correct any errors in a timely manner. Self Financial 's failure to accurately report my account details not only violates the FCRA but may also be in violation of state laws that protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. If applicable, I request the CFPB 's assistance in determining any state-specific consumer protection laws that might provide further recourse.",,Self Financial Inc.,TX,77494,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10510486

Please consider this letter as a formal request under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) for a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy of the disputed information, as well as the contact details ( business name, address, and phone number ) of any entity that provided the information in question. 

In addition, I want to clarify that my goal is not to merely update my file with my UCC-1 financial transactions. I expect that these transactions be properly recorded and posted on my credit report like any other tradeline. This includes reflecting them as active financial obligations and reporting them in the same way other debts, loans, and tradelines are listed on my credit report. It is essential that my UCC-1 filings be handled with the same standards and procedures as any other tradeline reported to credit bureaus.

I will be submitting the necessary documents to verify my identity through your Consumer Portal as per your instructions. 

Please keep me informed of any further actions required from my side and update me on the status of my dispute and the inclusion of my UCC-1 financial transactions on my credit report at your earliest convenience.

This complaint concerns a case of identity theft and the failure of J J MARSHALL ASSOCIATES to properly verify the ownership of the debt before reporting it. The key facts of the situation are as follows : The debt in question was originally held by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which they charged off and subsequently closed. Afterward, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sold the debt to J J MARSHALL ASSOCIATES, a debt buyer. Despite the fact that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had charged off and closed the account, J J MARSHALL ASSOCIATES is now reporting the debt as open and active on my credit report. I requested debt validation from J J MARSHALL ASSOCIATES, and they failed to provide any sufficient proof that this debt belongs to me. It appears that J J MARSHALL ASSOCIATES simply relied on information provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX without conducting a proper investigation to verify my identity or my involvement with this debt. After careful review, I believe this debt has been incorrectly assigned to me due to identity theft, as I have no knowledge or record of this account. As a result, J J MARSHALL ASSOCIATES is reporting this debt on my credit report, which has caused significant damage to my credit score and has led to undue stress. I have made multiple attempts to resolve this matter directly with them, but they have not provided adequate evidence that I am the rightful owner of this debt. In light of the above, I respectfully request the following : The immediate cessation of all collection activities related to this debt by J J MARSHALL ASSOCIATES, as required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) when a debt is disputed and identity theft is alleged. A thorough investigation into the validity of this debt, ensuring that J J MARSHALL ASSOCIATES follows the proper procedures to validate the debt before reporting it on my credit report.

I have noticed each time, Im declined. Finally a couple of days I ago, I decided to pull up my credit report from Experian and noticed that they were reporting that I had high delinquent activity.

So I pulled my full report on Experian, and saw there was no delinquent activity. I have 15 accounts and all accounts are current and never late. 
For example, my Fico score XXXX in AUTO says I have High delinquent activity. But, Not one of my car payments in the last 8 years have been late, repocessed or delinquent. Matter of fact I have never had delinquent activity on ANY of my vehicles. So my Fico score is XXXX why is Experian saying high delinquency? Is this a sick game????

It made complete since, as to why I have not been approved for any personal loans.

So I sent a complaint to Experian dispute center, they emailed me this morning saying I reached the membership center ( not true ) and to call their number. When you call their number it never directs you to a dispute center.

I believe I am entitled to a loan discharge due to fraudulent and deceptive practices by XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as improper loan processing and servicing by MOHELA. 

Background of Fraudulent Practices at XXXX XXXX XXXX : I attended XXXX XXXX XXXX during XXXX, a period in which the school engaged in widespread fraudulent practices that misled students, including myself, about program accreditatiXXXX, job placement rates, and the overall value of the education provided. The school falsely advertised its programs, failed to deliver on the promises made to students, and engaged in high-pressure recruiting tactics that targeted vulnerable individuals. 

Furthermore, there have been numerous reports and findings by federal and state agencies confirming that XXXX XXXX XXXX engaged in systemic fraud that left many students with substantial debt and no viable career prospects. As a result of these actions, I believe I am eligible for a "" Borrower Defense to Repayment '' discharge. 

Issues with Loan Processing and Servicing by MOHELA : In addition to the fraudulent practices of XXXX XXXX XXXX, there were irregularities in the loan processing and servicing by MOHELA, which has compounded the financial harm caused by my enrollment at XXXX XXXX. Specifically, I believe there were discrepancies in how my loans were processed, and I have experienced difficulty in receiving accurate information and assistance from MOHELA regarding my repayment options and loan management. 

These issues have added further hardship to an already difficult situation, and I believe that these factors, combined with the fraudulent practices of the school, provide grounds for a full discharge of my loan obligations. 

Request for Loan Discharge : In light of the circumstances outlined above, I am requesting the complete dismissal of my federal student loans issued in connection with my attendance at XXXX XXXX XXXX, due to the following reasons : 1. Fraudulent and deceptive practices by XXXX XXXX XXXX, which misled me about the nature and value of its educational programs. 
2. Irregularities in loan processing and servicing by MOHELA, which have caused further financial harm and confusion.

I kindly ask that you review my case and consider my application for discharge under the "" Borrower Defense to Repayment '' program. I have attached the necessary documentation to support my request, including [ list any documents you have, such as enrollment records, loan statements, and any correspondence with MOHELA or XXXX XXXX ]. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I hope for a prompt and favorable resolution. Should you require any additional information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

2024-10-19,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Upon information and belief on or about the dates of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX approximately XXXX fraudulent student loans were taken out in my name and disbursements were made to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  in XXXX XXXX West Virginia. In as much as these loans have been in my name for an extended period of time, I was never aware that these loans were actually fraudulent and the recipient was XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX There is a substantial amount of money due on these loans and I have never attended, taken classes or been a student at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. Upon reaching out to XXXX XXXX XXXX  I was denied contact with anyone in the records department and they refused to provide me with any information in regard to these fraudulent loans. That being said, I later received an email from XXXX advising me that I needed to provide them with a plethora of information and personal records, to verify these loans were not mine. I am wondering if this university obtain these same records when these loans were taken out in my name by the person that utilized these loans distributions. XXXX has refused to give me any student account numbers, records or any other documentation in regard to these loans. Upon being made aware to two other fraudulent loans to another institution the representative made me aware of these loans to XXXX that is when I reached out to the. I have been advised by a number of staff members that I am not allowed to speak with anyone by phone but that I need to speak email all documents that they have requested to the email from which it came. I am not giving these people my birth certificate, drivers license, high school diploma or any other documents. I have no idea if these documents will be used for nefarious purposes or if they will then say that they have my records on file and these are my student loans. I have never sent this institution any records at any point prior to them asking for them now because I have never attended or taken classes through them and definitely over a five year span. Thes loans are over a span of 5 years. There are no records to show and I have no academic records there and no benefit of these fraudulent loans ever. I have listed out the loan amount but original and current, and the dates that the loans were obtained. I have no loan numbers or student information to provide other than what I was given from AidAdvantage when I reached out to them. I have contacted the United States Department of Education on a number of occasions and they have also refused to give me any information I was advised that I need to contact the servicer of the loans and or access my student loan account in the system. I have advised them on a number of occasions that I am not able to access my federal student loan account because I do not remember my password and to reset it goes to an old phone number for which I no longer have and no longer have access to. The representative from the United States Department of Education that I spoke with last time could not help and told me I needed to contact the United States Department of Education. Upon questioning her as to was she with this department she advised she was but she could not help me to call back the same number I called and speak with another representative however she was not sure that they could help me either. It is very infuriating that employees for any and all businesses are not properly trained and take XXXX pride in their jobs anymore. What I know is if I did my job like 90 % of the people I deal with on a daily basis my employer would fire me. The bottom line is these are not my loans, I did not use these loans, I did not benefit from these loans and I took not classes through APU and I have never been a student there. All I have been told is that this is not an uncommon occurrence and it is up to the person whose name the fraudulent loans have been taken out in their name to get these records straight and not up to the servicer to verify they are valid in fact they have advised me that they are on the grantor of the loan and they are responsible for collecting the loans if it goes into default. Thats it and they can not help with any additional correction of the fraud and they will not assist in getting them corrected. Its a same that it takes days and months out of XXXX persons life to get straight identity theft and fraud. The information on the loans is as follows. 
XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX loan in the amount of {$6000.00} now {$12000.00} XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX loan in the amount of {$3500.00} now {$5900.00} XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX loan in the amount of {$1700.00} now {$2200.00} These loans now total approximately {$41000.00} and are now if forbearance because they were reported as in default and my credit score has decrease XXXX by these inaccurate credit bureau reportings. I am in the process of filing a police report for identity theft and fraud, and have reached out to a consumer law firm. They are willing to take my case and have these loans deleted from my records and name, and take these creditors to federal court if I can not rectify this situation myself. I filed a XXXX XXXX in XXXX and it was XXXX in XXXX. I also reopened the XXXX  XXXX in XXXX and it was dismissed as a not asset distribution in XX/XX/XXXX. Had I known at the time of filing or reopening the XXXX XXXX that these loans were fraudulent I would have filed a motion to have the judge order these loans be refunded and returned to the Department of Education. I have obtained a court date for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX. to file a motion to reopen the cause once again and at that time will file a motion for sanction and a motion to rule for show cause and now that I have determined that these loans are fraud also include that in the motions. These fraudulent loans need to removed from my name, deleted from by credit reports and funds returned back to United States Department of Education. I am not accepting responsibility for these loans and I am not oppose to taking this matter to court in it means retaining an attorney and having it filed in the circuit court as well as all other courts. My goal in this matter is to have the fraudulent loans addressed, refunded and returned to the United States Department of Education, and removed and deleted from my name.

2024-10-19,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Loan sold or transferred to another company,"XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that my mortgage was being transferred effective XX/XX/year>, and they could not accept any more payments after that date. I made my XXXX payment to XXXX prior to that date, it was received and processed by XXXX which left my account paid up to date. My next payment should have been due in XXXX. I contacted XXXX several times asking how and where to make my upcoming payments. They advised me that the new mortgage company would contact me with that information, that it was common for delays during mortgage transfers, and that I would have an extended grace period because of that. On XX/XX/year> I received the first communication from Shellpoint Mortgage. It was a packet containing a regulatory notice, claiming that I was behind on my payments by {$2500.00}. My monthly payment is {$1200.00}. So I have no idea where they came up with that number. It contained intimidating verbiage about foreclosure and Shellpoints rights to foreclose. It contained no information about how to make a payment, and no confirmation of the terms of the loan, which they can not legally change anyways. I believe they are intentionally trying to create a late payment status by manipulating my ability to make a timely payment on my mortgage account. The fact that I didnt receive any type of communication from Shellpoint until 18 days after my payment is normally due, and I still dont know how to make a payment because they have not provided that information, is what I believe to be mortgage servicing abuse.

2024-10-19,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Dear CFPB, I am submitting this new complaint regarding an unresolved issue with PayPals handling of a {$7100.00} payment I made on XX/XX/year>, toward my PayPal XXXX Mastercard balance. This issue was previously addressed in my original complaint, CFPB Case Number XXXX, but has yet to be fully resolved Subject : Rebuttal to PayPals Response and Request for Clarification on Payment Discrepancy and Bank Response XXXX CFPB Case Number : XXXX Dear CFPB, I am submitting this rebuttal in response to PayPals explanation regarding the {$7100.00} payment I made on XX/XX/year>, and its subsequent return. I believe PayPals response does not fully address the discrepancies in the payment process, nor does it explain the issues I encountered with both PayPal and my bank. Below are several key points that need further clarification and documentation. 

Discrepancy in Payment Records : On XX/XX/year>, I made a payment of {$7100.00}, which my PayPal credit card statement shows as accepted. However, PayPal later claimed that the payment was returned, but there is no such return reflected anywhere on my credit card statement. Instead, the statement includes an Adjustment-Payments entry, which is not clearly labeled as an ACH return or payment reversal. I am requesting clarification from PayPal on what this adjustment specifically refers to and why there is no clear record of the payment return. 

Payment Should Have Been Processed on XX/XX/XXXX : It is important to note that I had sufficient funds ( {$10000.00} ) in my bank account at the time of the payment on XX/XX/year>. Under normal circumstances, the payment of {$7100.00} should have been processed successfully on that date. The fact that this payment was not processed, despite having enough funds, suggests that an error occurred either on PayPals end or with my bank.

Given that my PayPal statement initially showed the payment as completed, and there was no clear reversal or adjustment labeled as an XXXX return, I am requesting further clarification on why the payment was not processed correctly. 

Available Funds and Banks Role : At the time of the payment, I had {$10000.00} in my bank account, more than sufficient to cover the payment. Despite this, my bank has indicated that they did not send the funds to PayPal, citing insufficient funds as the reason. However, my transaction history with the bank shows the payment as completed, creating a significant discrepancy between what my records show and what the bank claims. 

In a conversation with my banks representative, they could not provide the specific time when the payment was processed, claiming it was never sent. Yet, the payment is marked as completed on my account, which further adds to the confusion. 

The bank also mentioned that several smaller payments were made to PayPal around the same time, but this does not explain why the {$7100.00} payment wasnt processed, especially since sufficient funds were available.

Notification of Returned Payment : PayPal claims that I was notified of the returned payment on XX/XX/year>, and that my financial institution also notified me. However, I did not receive clear notification from PayPal, and the explanation from my bank has been inconsistent. I ask that PayPal provide evidence of this notification and any communication sent to me regarding the returned payment. Additionally, I would like further clarification on how they claim my bank notified me. 

Inaccurate Venmo Credit Card Banner : PayPal admits that I received a notice regarding the returned payment with a Venmo Credit Card banner, even though I do not have a Venmo credit card. While they state this was an error, it contributed to the overall confusion regarding my account and the returned payment. I ask that PayPal ensure no future errors like this occur and clarify why this mistake happened.

Fees and Payment History : PayPal mentioned a payment of {$100.00} made on XX/XX/year>, which was below the minimum required payment, resulting in fees. Given the larger payment I made later that month ( which was allegedly returned ), I request that PayPal review these fees and whether they were applied fairly given the subsequent payment.

Lack of Address Update : PayPal claims that I did not update my mailing address during calls on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/year>. However, I made efforts to update my contact information during these conversations and in past several calls over the years since moving to my new location in XXXX. This may have contributed to delays in communication, and I request that PayPal confirm that all account information is fully updated.

Banks Role and Lack of ACH Documentation : My bank has indicated that the payment was never sent, despite PayPals claim that it was returned. This discrepancy remains unresolved, and I ask that PayPal provide detailed evidence of the XXXX return process, including communications with my bank, to clarify why the payment did not go through. 

I have repeatedly requested a detailed explanation from my bank regarding why the funds were not sent, yet they have not provided this information. I will be filing a separate complaint with the CFPB regarding my banks failure to provide the requested information. 

Request for Documentation : I am requesting that PayPal provide documentation and proof of the following : 1. The exact date and time they claim to have received the {$7100.00} payment.

2. The date and reason for the return of the funds, along with any records from my bank indicating why the payment was returned.

Request for Further Review : I respectfully request that PayPal be required to provide more detailed documentation on : The exact reason for the returned payment.

Clear documentation showing why the funds were not processed.

Proper communication between PayPal and my bank.

How can PayPal claim I paid in full and report this to two credit agencies if the funds were never sent?

How can PayPal return funds that were never sent?

Attachments : I have attached the following documents for further evidence : 1. Conversation with my bank : Documenting my efforts to clarify why the funds were not sent.

2. Tracking information : Proof of my formal letter to the bank requesting a detailed explanation of the returned funds.

3. Monthly statement : Showing the unclear Adjustment-Payments entry instead of a clear ACH return or reversal.

The failure to process this payment and the subsequent return is either an error on PayPals part or my banks. I request further investigation into why this payment failed, despite having more than sufficient funds in my account at the time.

Request for Resolution : I am seeking assistance in obtaining a clear and accurate resolution to this issue. PayPals inconsistent handling of the payment, along with my banks lack of response, has caused significant confusion and financial stress. I would like this matter to be resolved with transparency from both parties.

Attached are my credit card statements showing the payment as accepted, a transcript of my conversation with my bank, and letter tracking number screenshots of my request for information from my bank. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to further clarification and resolution.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,MN,55122,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10510713

2024-10-19,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I am filing a formal complaint against Equifax for their failure to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) in relation to the removal of inaccurate personal information from my credit report, as well as their failure to respond within the legally mandated 30-day timeframe. 

Details of the Complaint : Dispute of Inaccurate Personal Information : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a formal dispute to Equifax ( Dispute ID : XXXX ), clearly stating that my one and only legal name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and my correct address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Additionally, I confirmed my correct phone number as XXXX. 

Despite this, Equifax continues to report numerous incorrect names, addresses, and phone numbers on my credit report, including : Inaccurate Names : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and others. 
Inaccurate Addresses : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and several more incorrect addresses that I have never lived at.

This failure to correct the errors violates FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ), which requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy in consumer reports. 

Failure to Respond within 30 Days : It has been over 30 days since Equifax received my dispute, and I have yet to receive any formal response or resolution. Under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), credit reporting agencies are required to respond to disputes within 30 days, and this failure constitutes a clear violation of the law.

Resolution Sought : I request that the CFPB take the following actions to ensure Equifax complies with the FCRA : Immediately delete all inaccurate personal information from my credit report, including all incorrect names, addresses, and phone numbers that are not my own.

Ensure that Equifax provides an updated and accurate credit report reflecting these corrections.

Investigate Equifaxs failure to respond within the 30-day period as mandated by law, and take appropriate enforcement action for this violation. 
Enclosed are copies of my original dispute letter sent to Equifax and proof of receipt, as well as my credit report showing the inaccurate personal information still being reported. 

I trust the CFPB will take prompt action to resolve this matter and ensure Equifax 's compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TX,77084,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10512657

2024-10-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"RE : Late Payment Improperly Reported- I XXXX XXXX have a RIGHT TO PRIVACY under 15 USC 1681A ( 4 ) as a federally protected consumer and I know my rights presented under the Fair Credit Reporting Act clearly outlined within 15 USC 1681. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So, whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent. I was reviewing my consumer reports and noticed XXXX XXXX on my credit report that need be immediately updated to paid as agreed. My Consumer rights have been violated by XXXX, XXXX, Equifax. XXXX, XXXX, Equifax, has violated my consumer rights and violated federal law. This is now multiple attempts to notify you of this erroneous error on the part of your agency. This erroneous late payment is affecting my ability to obtain a loan to save my business from crumbling and also blocking me from the housing that I so desperately need for myself and my family. Please change this to paid as agreed immediately so that I may proceed with my life, or I may be forced to seek legal damages against your agency as I already have sought legal counsel in this more than important matter.

Due to my health, I was unaware of these activities until my condition improved, at which point I began submitting disputes with both the creditors and credit bureaus. The creditors have investigated and confirmed the accounts were fraudulent, issuing deletion letters. Several creditors also confirmed that the transaction records are no longer available due to the age of the accounts and transfers to multiple parties. In other cases, creditors deleted the accounts without requiring further investigation based on the strength of the evidence. 

However, XXXX continues to report these fraudulent accounts. Despite having provided the FTC Identity Theft Report, proof of identity, and creditor deletion letters multiple times, XXXX refuses to delete these accounts, citing that I may have benefited from the transactions a baseless claim, especially since no transaction records have been provided to me, nor do the original creditors possess them. I have requested these transaction records from both XXXX and the creditors for over a year to no avail. 

XXXX 's implication that I benefited from these transactions, without providing any proof, is deeply harmful and unsupported by any evidence. Their failure to produce the transaction records or provide a detailed investigation contradicts their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Furthermore, I understand that credit reporting bureaus do not generally maintain transaction records ; however, since XXXX is referring to these transactions, I suspect they may have more access to this data than they are disclosing. 

Additionally, I am not interested in providing more evidence as I have already submitted more than is legally required.

Furthermore, it is imperative that you notify XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax to delete this information from my credit report immediately. The account in question is detailed as follows : XXXX XXXX  As per IRS regulations, a canceled debt of {$600.00} or more necessitates the filing of a 1099-C form by federal or government agencies, or applicable financial entities. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes tax fraud, a serious offense that I will not hesitate to report to the IRS. 

It is essential to understand that a canceled debt is considered ordinary income by the IRS. Consequently, any failure to file a 1099-C form, or any attempt to conceal such actions, constitutes inaccurate reporting. Income is not to be included on a credit report, and any such inclusion violates consumer laws and regulations. 

Your company 's actions are in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC 1681s-2, which outlines the responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies. Under this statute, it is prohibited to furnish inaccurate information knowingly or with reasonable cause to believe it is inaccurate. 

It is evident from my previous communication and this notice that there is reasonable cause to believe the information provided is inaccurate. Therefore, it is imperative that you take immediate steps to rectify this situation by deleting the inaccurate information from all consumer reporting agencies. 

Failure to comply will result in legal action being pursued, including holding the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, accountable for willful noncompliance under 15 USC 1681n ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

My complaint is based on their failure to report accurate information in my consumer report. 

On XX/XX/year>, I mailed my dispute to TransUnion regarding inaccurate reporting of my car loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ). As of today, XX/XX/year>, it has been over 30 days, and I have yet to receive a satisfactory resolution. This inaccurate information has been present in my consumer report for over a year. 

I have maintained communication with XXXX  about the status of this account and possess all supporting documentation to substantiate my claims. Additionally, I have a transcript of my conversation with XXXX  confirming that my account was never reported as a charge-off. 

I would like to draw your attention to the following provisions of the FCRA that support my request : - **15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ** states that A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 
- **15 U.S. Code 1681e** mandates that Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of section 1681c of this title and to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b of this title. 

It is my belief that TransUnion and other credit bureaus are not maintaining reasonable procedures as required by law. 

I kindly request your assistance in ensuring that this inaccurate account is removed from my consumer report. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

2024-10-19,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"For starters : I had a XXXX  card I made reservations with for XXXX XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX posted in the XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX  account was closed XX/XX/XXXX and the card deactivated. Before I arrived the card was used to make the reservation. after being closed XXXX  had told me the merchant can force payment from a deactivated card. Since I paid venmo in person at the front desk on the XXXX this became a duplicate charge. And because the card is deactivated and the account closed, XXXX  has said I can not dispute this charge. So to satisfy the debt owed I disputed the second charge made with venmo for that day to clear the debt and officially have the account out of the negative. I am currently paying a credit cleaner XXXX dollars to clean up my credit to be able to apply for business loans. This unpaid charge from XXXX is not helping at all. That brings me to my claim. 

Venmo has again decided to deny my dispute of a duplicate charge for the second time. On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a dispute for XXXX due to paying twice for that day. I didn't catch the charge right away due to not checking a closed XXXX  account. I started receiving emails that my account was overdrawn. And thinking XXXX  was mistaken I checked it. And there was my balance at XXXX. So after I sent the dispute in on the XXXX it was denied despite having screenshots of the XXXX charge. It was denied 30 minutes after I submitted the documents. So I called venmo and spent over an hour on the phone with XXXX XXXXin the disputes department. We went through the dispute with a fine tooth comb. She told me specifically what they look for when deciding and I sent those documents to her. She looked them over and said that was perfect it shouldn't be a problem. And the case was reopened on XX/XX/XXXX. I also filed a dispute for a partial credit of XXXX XXXX charge of XXXX dollars due to being over charged by XXXX XXXX  in spite of not having hot water and no water at all during the day. I provided proof the hotel knows about the water issue and there is a history of prorated rates due to the inconvenience. However a rude and nasty front desk clerk forced me to pay the rates of XXXX dollars on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX dollars on XX/XX/XXXX for the XXXX. She knew I has paid for the XXXX with XXXX XXXX and checking out would forfeit them. As well as hotels were booked for a football game. Not honoring the prorated rate ive been paying and had a history of paying with my venmo card. XX/XX/XXXX I disputed the XXXX dollars of the XXXX. Only to find out XX/XX/XXXX both the XXXX XXXX duplicate charge and the partial credit were denied. The duplicate charge for a second time because they spoke with the hotel and they said they refunded the charge. And im not guaranteed hot water when I booked the room. And im disgusted. 
# 1 ) the hotel can not refund the payment to a deactivated card and closed account. Well they could but they didn't. But I can't dispute it with XXXX. I have to pay it. 
# 2 ) XXXX I sent venmo my actual bank statement printed from XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX the XXXX showing its the only charge for that month. And proof to this day my account is in the negative for that precise amount. And venmo took the word of the hotel over literal proof they lied. But didn't request from choice hotel proof of refund. 
# 3 ) I opened a dispute today for the XXXX dollars of the XXXX I was charged by a rude and vindictive front desk clerk for XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX not honoring the prorated rate for the inconvenience of no water until XXXX  and no hot water at all. Knowing I would lose my point already paid for Sunday. 
I really need cfpb to compell venmo to do the right thing. Im shocked that venmo has taken the word of someone who refuses to pay the hotels gas bill over a bank statement and ledger charge as proof. I also sent with appeal a screenshot of an email with hotel management proving a history of prorated rates to match previous charges with previous venmo payments. And that they've been accommodating me due to the inconvenience. But somehow I was denied. I cant produce anything more concrete than a bank statement and current negative ledger balance to date at this point. And with no new documentation venmo will just deny it again unless forced to do the right thing. I was told what I sent was perfect documentation of proof of duplicate payment. So why was the word of a liar at the hotel more valid than the documents they require, being provided? And why didn't the hotel have to provide receipt of the refund to the card? I know they cant produce that. But the fact they didnt have to produce receipt of refund, when protcol stated I did to even request an appeal, only to be denied is unacceptable. And is enough for me to number my days with venmo. But before I go.

2024-10-19,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"Discrimination Case Against Barclays Bank Background : On XX/XX/year>, I attempted to make a reservation for a family vacation for nine adults traveling from XXXX, FL, to XXXX, XXXX. There was a special deal with XXXX XXXX listed on the XXXX website for round-trip tickets from XX/XX/year>, to XX/XX/year>, priced at approximately {$1100.00} each. As a long-time holder of a JetBlue credit card issued by Barclays Bank , I had a total credit balance of {$15000.00}, with over {$12000.00} available, along with approximately {$4000.00} in cash in my XXXX bank account. 
Incident : 1. Initial Purchase Attempt : I attempted to purchase three tickets but was prevented by XXXX 's system from using my cash funds for a flight involving another carrier. Consequently, I tried to purchase the tickets using my credit card for a total of {$3300.00}, but my transactions were rejected twice by Barclays.

2. Customer Service Experience : Frustrated, I called Barclays customer service. The representative was rude, particularly after learning my name ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and that I was calling from XXXX, XXXX. Despite verifying my identity, he insisted on a phone verification that I could not complete while on the line, then blocked my credit card account and hung up. 
3. Subsequent Calls : After calling back, I spoke with another representative who initially seemed helpful and sent me a verification code, which I confirmed. However, after a brief distraction while talking to his manager, he became rude and informed me that my credit card would remain blocked and I would lose access to my online account. He requested that I fax several documents, despite my overseas location.

4. Document Submission : I arranged for my daughter in the XXXX to prepare and fax the required documents. After several unsuccessful attempts due to claims of unclear faxes, I had her send the documents by mail, causing further delays. 
5. Continued Rejections : Two weeks later, a representative confirmed receipt of the documents but rejected my Social Security card because it lacked a stamp. I explained that this was the original document and could not be stamped, but she remained unhelpful and insisted that my account would remain blocked. 
6. Payment Issues : On XX/XX/year>, I was informed my account was overdue, even though I had mailed my payment on XX/XX/year>, which had already been cashed. My attempts to resolve the issue were met with repeated disconnections during calls. 
7. Ongoing Frustration : By XX/XX/year>, after multiple calls and failed attempts to resolve my account issues, I felt at a dead end. The rejection of my Social Security card and the overall treatment I received appeared discriminatory, particularly given my identity as an XXXX and XXXX. 
Consequences : 1. Due to Barclays ' overly stringent security measures specially against me, I was forced to purchase separate tickets for my family, resulting in a loss of {$6400.00} compared to the original fare. 
2. I lost between XXXX to XXXX frequent flyer miles. 
3. My credit card was locked, preventing access to nearly {$12000.00} in available credit. 
4. This XXXX XXXX issued by Barclays incurs an annual fee of {$99.00}, along with late fees and high interest rates, further complicating access to my account and statements. 
5. Barclays prevented me to let have an access on my account and refused to mail my statements to assist with my income tax. 
6. The block on my online account led to late payments, harming my credit score.

7. The verification process seemed discriminatory, particularly after the representative learned my name and location.

8. Barclays issued a false statement claiming I was late on my XXXX payments for more than 30 days, which was untrue because I had proven that it cash my check on XX/XX/XXXX which been mailed on XX/XX/XXXX for the due date of XX/XX/XXXX and harmed my payment history and credit score. 
9. Barclays decreased my line of credit from {$15000.00} to {$3700.00}. 
10. These actions affected my credit score by more than XXXX points in XXXX months, resulting in financial losses from other creditors. 
11. Barclays took these significant actions over a simple transaction with XXXX XXXX, which was confirmed twice and not a fraud or misleading transaction. 
12. Barclays asked for my driver license ID, a recent utility bill, and my social security card, which I fax twice and then mailed, and after received it decline my social security card. 
13. If Barclays does not accept valid U.S. documents from its citizens, it raises concerns about their ability to operate in the XXXX market. 
14. This situation has persisted for over five months, causing significant financial and emotional distress and real loses of {$70000.00} of line of credit and over {$10000.00} in cash due to misappropriation and discrimination 15. I believe XXXX XXXX would be concerned about the impact on their business due to this issue. 
Conclusion : The treatment I received from Barclays Bank appears discriminatory and has caused significant financial harm.

2024-10-19,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Goldman Sachs due to their policy limitations with the Apple Card, which have caused significant negative impacts on my credit score and financial standing. I believe Goldman Sachs should take responsibility for these issues and provide a satisfactory resolution. 

When XXXX first launched, I created an XXXX XXXX using my personal email address for my XXXX  purchases. Later, when XXXX introduced the XXXX, XXXX was launched as a way to sync all your devices, I subscribed and was given a XXXX email, which became a second XXXXXXXX XXXX that was required to sync my devices. Over time, XXXX transitioned from XXXX to XXXX, making XXXX a free service for the public. Throughout these platform changes, I continued using the XXXX XXXX XXXX as my main account, while my purchases remained tied to my original XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX 

Unfortunately, XXXX has never provided a solution to merge these multiple XXXX XXXX, which has left me in a difficult position. Recently, I subscribed to XXXX XXXX XXXX to share services with my elderly parents, which highlighted the long-standing conflict between my XXXX XXXX XXXX. After extensive time on the phone with XXXX XXXX and multiple visits to the XXXX XXXX, it became clear that merging these accounts was not possible. Therefore, I manually transferred data from my XXXX  account to my original XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  in order to preserve my purchases from the past 21 years. 

In order to consolidate everything to XXXX XXXX XXXX, the last step was to transfer my Apple Card from my XXXX XXXX XXXX to my XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX However, I was informed by Goldman Sachs Apple Card Support that it was not possible due to fraud protection policies. As a result, I was left with two unacceptable options : either I could retain my Apple Card under the XXXX XXXX XXXX and lose access to the purchases I had made since 2003, or I could close my Apple Card account and apply for a new one under my XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. 

Unfortunately, I was forced to choose the latter option in order to put everything, once and for all, under XXXX XXXX XXXX, which resulted in a negative impact on my credit score. According to XXXX, my score dropped from XXXX to XXXX, and according to XXXX, it dropped from XXXX to XXXX. Moreover, my credit limit was reduced from {$22000.00} to {$10000.00} as an introductory limit on the new card, despite my excellent payment history with the previous card, where I consistently paid off my balance early every month and never had a late payment. This decline in my credit score is the direct result of closing the Apple Card account, a decision I had no control over due to the policy limitations imposed by Goldman Sachs. 

In light of this situation, I believe Goldman Sachs must take responsibility for the negative impact their policy has had on me. A satisfactory resolution to this issue would include the following steps : 1. Goldman Sachs should provide a letter to each of the three major credit bureausXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXinforming them that their policy failure forced me to close my Apple Card account against my will and reopen another card which automatically gave me a lesser limit through no fault of my own which caused an unnecessary hit to my credit score and request the restoration of my credit score.

2. Goldman Sachs should provide me with copies of these letters so that I may follow up directly with the credit agencies. 

3. Goldman Sachs should restore my credit limit to the previous {$22000.00}, which was the limit on my original card.

4. Goldman Sachs should make a concerted effort to change their policy so that this issue does not affect other customers in the future. 

I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take this matter seriously and assist in ensuring a fair resolution. I place a high level of importance on maintaining my credit score, and I am deeply concerned that a company would implement a policy that negatively impacts its customers ' credit standing. Such a policy raises serious concerns about the fairness of its practices and the long-term effects on consumer credit health. 

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

2024-10-19,Debt collection,Telecommunications debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"I am filing this complaint against Security Credit Services , LLC, for engaging in deceptive and misleading practices in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Over the course of my interactions with them, Security Credit Services has demonstrated multiple failures and violations that have caused significant harm and confusion regarding a disputed debt account under my name.

Here are the key issues Ive faced : 1. Failure to Report Dispute Status to Credit Bureaus ( Violation of FCRA ) : Despite Security Credit Services claim in their correspondence that they reported my account as disputed to the credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ), I have confirmed through my XXXX credit report that no such update was made. 
This is a violation of the FCRA as they are required to report accurate information, including dispute statuses, to the credit bureaus. The failure to do so is misleading and harms my credit standing. 

2. Misleading and Conflicting Contact Information ( Violation of FDCPA ) : Security Credit Services has repeatedly provided inconsistent and conflicting addresses, making it impossible to communicate effectively with them regarding this debt. 
Here are the addresses Ive received : An initial invalid address : ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ), which resulted in returned certified mail ( evidence available ). 
A second address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 
A third address : po box XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 
These conflicting addresses are not only confusing but also suggest that Security Credit Services is deliberately avoiding transparency and making it difficult for me, as the consumer, to resolve the matter. This behavior violates the FDCPA, which requires debt collectors to provide accurate contact information and act in good faith.

3. Failure to Properly Investigate My Identity Theft Claim ( Violation of FDCPA ) : I reported this debt as fraudulent due to identity theft, providing Security Credit Services with my FTC Identity Theft Report, police report, and bank notice of a data breach ( related to the theft of my personal information ).

Despite this, Security Credit Services has failed to properly investigate my claim, instead repeatedly asking for unnecessary documents ( such as a notarized affidavit ), which I have already provided through other means. This delay and failure to act promptly further violate their obligations under the FDCPA. 

4. Deceptive Practices in Requesting Additional Documentation : Security Credit Services continues to demand more personal information, such as a State Issued ID and notarized Affidavit of Forgery. Given that I am a victim of identity theft, I am extremely hesitant to provide further sensitive information to a company that has already demonstrated a lack of professionalism and good faith. 
Their insistence on this additional documentation, despite having sufficient proof of the fraudulent nature of the debt, further illustrates their bad-faith approach to this matter. 

Supporting Evidence : I have attached the following documents to support my complaint : Letters from Security Credit Services showing multiple conflicting addresses. 
Return receipts and proof of failed communication attempts due to their invalid contact information.

It is a violation to report my transactions or experiences between you and I with a third party or consumer reporting agency without my written consent. It is the policy stated by Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers to insure the security and confidentiality of their customer records and information. This includes protecting against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

I the consumer should have been given the opportunity, before such information was to be reported which gives me the option to direct you that such information should not be reported. I also should have been explained how I could exercise that nondisclosure option, which I was never advised. I have written multiple times, and you have continued to ignore my written request.

Your failure to comply with the law and my written request has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Again, I am requesting to opt out of sharing my nonpublic information and for you to remove all my transaction history from all nonaffiliated
third parties such as XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX immediately. Otherwise, I will pursue legal actions for every month my nonpublic information has been reported which could be a fine of {$1000.00} per violation.

I had a man ask me into his store, XXXX, when I was walking through a shopping plaza. I said no was on my way back to the hotel where my husband was waiting. He said no problem I just want to give you coupon to the store we are opening in XXXX Florida where I am from. Just take a minute. I was there over XXXX hours just trying to get back to my husband. It was one product after another. I had kept saying no and then decided the best way to get out was to just get the product and I could return it or cancel it. Now that I think back it was very strange how they made you fill out a shipping label for each item individually. Then after filling out the shipping label, they would hand it back saying they just needed the signature to verify it was the correct address. As I said this went on over XXXX hours. The people were just talking about their families to me and showing me pictures of their children. I was in like a dental chair laying back with him standing beside me while all this was going on. I honestly could not wait to get out of there. I even told him I would never use the products ; I one point I said get this off me they made me XXXX 
Finally, I gave in and said fine just let me get this done to get back to my husband. I guess they know to just keep badgering older women, XXXX, on their own until they give in. 
Got back to the hotel and told my husband what I had just gone through. I was going to go home and call them to cancel it. 
We got home the XXXX of XXXX which was a Saturday and just before XXXX XXXX. 
Once at home I went to check on the company and see if other people had had the same issues as I had had. Oh, yes many said the same thing. Then I checked further and found the equipment was dangerous to use if you were taking medicines that would not let you in the sun for extended periods of time, which I am on. 
On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX after the holiday weekend, I called the company telling them I wanted to cancel the orders and that also I was unable to use all their products. She said no problem will we swap them all out for one of their products that was safe to use. I said why would I want all of them the same when each was supposed to do different things. I said no I want them all cancelled. Then that is when she said, "" Well you can't get refunds ''. I said I don't want them it will not be a refund you still have them I don't have any of your products. She said sorry they have already been shipped to you. I said then I will refuse them. I actually was not at my home the first time they tried to deliver them, then I left to take my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter for XXXX weeks to XXXX. I was out of the country the second time they tried to deliver. As it turned out I never did refuse the delivery. It also was very odd that the order was placed to be shipped by the company the day before I called, which was Monday XXXX XXXX. 
Now I have no products and have paid a total of {$9200.00}. 
I put in a request to have this charge removed from my account. They refuse because XXXX says I signed the no refunds shipping page, I called and was told NO refunds, and I refused the order. They are in the right said Comenity Bank when they sent me the letter on XX/XX/year>. On XX/XX/year>, I wrote a rebuttal letter and mailed it certified mail. They responded to by telling me to submit a billing dispute. That was a great reply since I was doing a rebuttal to the response of my dispute. On XX/XX/year> I again tried reaching out to Comenity Bank asking for a refund since I don't have anything to show for over {$9.00} XXXX dollars. They responded 2 days later on the XXXX of XXXX to tell me this claim was already closed and that a letter had been sent to me on XX/XX/year>. 
In my opinion XXXX has fought this battle many times and knows just what the credit cards want to see to justify the charges. 
I believe in my heart this is an elaborate scam to scam old ladies out of what money they do have, and the credit card company goes right along with it. It seems like a polite, legal way to steal from people, or should I say scam.

2024-10-19,Debt collection,I do not know,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"Company was attempting to collect on an alleged debt they claimed I was responsible for. When it was originally discovered on my consumer report, I was unaware of what it was pertaining to, Never received any debt validation prior to noticing it on my consumer report, and therefore mailed numerous requests for debt validation for this alleged debt they claimed I was responsible for, which I am not. This occurred back XXXX XXXX. See Previous complaint XXXX. In their response they stated they sent the requested debt validation ; however, nothing was received even though they stated it was by me. I dispute this alleged debt, as well as any ownership or responsibility for it still today. Furthermore, the data furnisher was back then reporting inaccurate and mismatched data across all 3 of my consumer credit reports. They stated this was a "" Charge OFF '' with XXXX XXXX being an original creditor. I corresponded with XXXX who they claimed was the original creditor in an attempt to verify and validate any information on the alleged debt during which time XXXX responded, "" They have no record of the alleged account or me having one ''. 

For all of these reasons and the data furnisher failing to provide the original documents and validation to include the purchase agreement, The chain of custody, and information verifying that i was responsible for the alleged debt, along with the continues phone calls from them, I sent a CEASE AND DESISTS LETTER to cease any and all forms of communication with me. This original request was sent in late XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, I was still receiving numerous calls and contacts by them attempting to collect an alleged debt that i am not responsible for, and that they could not properly validate, and i sent a second CEASE AND DESIST LETTER to the debt collector. This letter was mailed via certified mail and delivery confirmed. I believed at this point that they honored by my request for the CEASE AND DESISTS for the alleged debt i am not responsible for however they continue reporting inaccuracies across my 3-consumer credit report to include multiple dates of alleged first delinquency re-aging the alleged debt. 

Well on XX/XX/XXXX, I again without any request made, received random documents in the mail once again from the data furnishing company trying to provide random statements, a letter with their own letter head listing my information, however it is missing numerous points of information still for the alleged debt. Their letterhead states ( WE ARE IN RECEIPT OF YOUR REQUEST FOR MORE INFROMATION ). I NEVER MADE ANY REQUEST TO THEM as well as this is now 7 months WELL AFTER at least 2 CEASE AND DESIST LETTERS WERE SENT TO THEM via USPS and verified delivery. 

I am requesting this matter be investigated, I am Requesting they be held accountable for their violations, and i respectfully request they stop reporting mismatched, unverified, and different information across the 3 credit bureaus on my consumer reports for an alleged debt i don't own, I'm not responsible for, I DISPUTE FULLY, That they re-aged, and the constant continuous harassment by them even after receiving my CEASE and DESIST REquest.

Making partial payments in advance is "" simply not allowed '' at XXXX / LoanCare. 
How is this legal? I am forced to barrow money to own a home, and when I would like to pay a portion of it back, I'm barred from doing so - just so the lender can maximize the interest they collect?

This debt is invalid due to the coercive and unethical practices involved in obtaining the original contract, as well as my status as a XXXX-XXXX  veteran with confirmed XXXX XXXX XXXX. Below, I will outline the circumstances surrounding the agreement and why I believe this derogatory mark should be removed from my credit report. 
Background : Date of Visit to XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/year> Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX Current Creditor : Monterey Financial Services, LLC Disputed Amount : {$14.00}, XXXX Details of the Incident : Upon my arrival at the airport in XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year>, I was approached by someone who claimed to be my shuttle service but instead led me to a promotional setup for XXXX XXXX. They enticed me with offers of free drinks and a massage, which persuaded me to agree to visit the resort the next day. 

On the day of the visit, I was transported to XXXX XXXX, where I was served brunch, accompanied by mimosas, followed by a tour of the resorts private residences. During the sales presentation, I was pressured into making a significant deposit on my credit card and signing a contract for a timeshare that I do not recall consenting to fully or understanding. I was under the influence of alcohol throughout this process. 

Subsequent Charges and Impact : Following this agreement, I began receiving charges of over {$200.00} per month from XXXX XXXX, which I was unaware I had agreed to. I have not returned to XXXX since this visit and have never used any of the services associated with the timeshare for which I am being billed. 

My credit score has been negatively impacted within the past month due to this issue, even though I have never agreed to make any payments on this debt, as I do not consider it mine. Over the past year, I have received multiple collections notices, and these financial and legal issues have caused me significant distress, especially after my separation from my partner. 

Despite my attempts to contact XXXX to discuss the debt, my efforts were ignored. I also contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX  to seek assistance, but they were unable to help due to the time passed and the status of the account being transferred to collections. 

I requested a copy of the contract from XXXX XXXX, as I do not recall signing it and have limited memory of the event due to my mental health conditions and the intoxication I was under at the time. 

My XXXX-XXXX  Status, XXXX XXXX and XXXX  : I am a XXXX XXXX  XXXX veteran diagnosed with XXXX  XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. At the time of my visit to XXXX XXXX, I was heavily XXXX  for these conditions, which severely affected my ability to make sound decisions in situations of stress or under the influence of alcohol.

2024-10-19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Changes in loan terms during or after closing,"I contacted XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) with NEXA Mortgage ( NMLS XXXX ) on a home purchase in XXXX. We were working on a "" piggyback '' purchase with a conventional 1st mortgage ( through XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) and a XXXX XXXX option. XXXX sent me initial disclosures on a rate of 4.875 % on XX/XX/year>. I used the interest rate, payment, and XXXX loan amount assured to me by XXXX to make an offer on a property ( which was accepted ) and set a close date for XX/XX/year>. Originally, I was told ( and provided numbers on an initial disclosure ) that I would be able to temporarily buy down the interest rate on my loan ( a XXXX buydown option ), have a XXXX loan at ~ $ XXXX, and bring approximately $ XXXX to closing ). Between then and today, several things have gone off the rails. 

XXXX has deliberately mislead and misstated loan terms and statuses in an effort to just "" get the deal done. '' Originally XXXX told me that he could find a XXXX loan program that would lend on my property in Missouri for an interest rate "" between 8 and 9 %. '' He send me numbers from one 2nd lender that quoted me out at 9 %, but proceeded to process my application through another lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) which priced me at 9.875 % ( and provided me a conditional approval letter on XX/XX/XXXX for a loan amount of ~ $ XXXX ). That loan was based on a purchase price of $ XXXX, when, in fact, the sale price of the property, as reflected on the sales contract which had been provided, was $ XXXX. I raised this to XXXX 's attention and he said "" It's no problem, they just have the wrong purchase amount, no big deal, they'll fix it. '' Throughout the process, I have routinely asked XXXX for updates on my loans and have either been ignored or provided answers like "" I've been working on this all day '' or "" you're almost through underwriting, I should have docs today. '' On Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I asked XXXX when I should lock in my rate. XXXX ignored my question and did not provide any answers on when that should occur. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX provided me another set of initial disclosures without explaining why the loan was redisclosed, despite my question. This disclosure still had an interest rate at 4.875 %. No answers were provided on why the new disclosures were needed. 

At approximately XXXX CT on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX ( less than a week before closing and after normal business hours, which limited my ability to escalate the issue, I believe intentionally ), XXXX called to inform me that the first loan was about to be redisclosed AGAIN, but at an interest rate of 5.5 %. And that the XXXX loan would only be approved at ~ $ XXXX and would require me to bring an ADDITIONAL $ XXXX to closing. This change was due to the fact that the XXXX mortgage lender mistakenly believed the purchase price to be $ XXXX ( rather than $ XXXX ) and the house appraised for more than $ XXXX, but less than $ XXXX, causing the XXXX lender to reduce the loan amount accordingly. 

I raised several concerns with XXXX about the differences in terms. His response was just sign the LE so we can get the XXXX tomorrow or else your loan wont close on time. He repeatedly told me to just sign the documents and everything would work out like it needed to on Monday, but threatened me that if I didnt, my closing would get pushed back and I might even lose the house. He repeatedly used my wifes pregnant condition ( she is due a couple of weeks after closing ) as an abusive technique to force me to sign unfavorable terms. 

XXXX has not only engaged in deceptive ( changing loan terms at the last minute ) and abusive ( just sign the documents or else ) practices, but has also exercised gross negligence in the processing of my loan packet from day one. We have emails back until the beginning of this application where he outright stated untrue claims. We also have emails documenting that our questions were either ignored or brushed aside. We also have text messages documenting similar statements. 

At this point, I do not know if I will be able to purchase this home because of Jasons and NEXAs actions ( or lack of actions ). My original purchase contract had me closing on XX/XX/XXXX and taking possession on XX/XX/XXXX. I am not only at risk for missing closing, but also losing the house, my $ XXXX XXXX money deposit, my fees for the inspection and appraisal. Additionally, my wife is almost 9 months pregnant and is due on XX/XX/XXXX. Because of XXXX and XXXX, I am at risk of being homeless when we give birth to this baby ( we have been staying in temporary housing in XXXX  XXXX until we close on this house ).",,"NEXA Mortgage, LLC",FL,344XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10512224
