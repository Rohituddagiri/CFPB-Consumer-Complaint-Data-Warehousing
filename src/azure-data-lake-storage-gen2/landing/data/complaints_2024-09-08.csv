2024-09-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"Complaint Details : 1. Description of the Issue : On XX/XX/year>XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted a letter to me, XXXX XXXX, stating that my auto loan was paid off. During this period, the XXXX XXXX  for the vehicle was released by XXXX XXXX and sent to me via mail, further confirming that the loan was settled. 

However, on XX/XX/year>, I discovered that XXXX XXXX had reported my account as past due and delinquent on my credit report. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX to resolve this discrepancy. During our discussions, XXXX XXXX admitted that they had mistakenly sent the letter on XX/XX/year>, incorrectly stating that the loan was paid off, and also released the vehicle title to me in error. Despite this admission, XXXX XXXX failed to inform me of any remaining balance prior to damaging my credit report. 

2. Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue : I attempted to negotiate with XXXX XXXX and sought a resolution, making it clear that : XXXX XXXX had reported the account as paid off in their letter. 
XXXX XXXX released the title to the auto, reinforcing the statement that the loan was settled. 
XXXX XXXX never contacted me by any means to address their mistake or to notify me of any outstanding balance before tarnishing my credit report. 
I was more than willing to pay any remaining balance if one existed, as I was under the impression, based on XXXX XXXX 's communication, that the loan was fully paid off. On XX/XX/year>, I paid the remaining balance immediately upon being informed. Despite this, XXXX XXXX has refused to remove the negative reports from my credit report that were due to their admitted errors. 

3. How This Issue Has Affected Me : The inaccurate reporting by XXXX XXXX has negatively impacted my credit score, causing undue stress and financial hardship. This mistake has affected my ability to obtain credit on reasonable terms, which is unfair given that the negative report resulted solely from XXXX XXXX 's admitted errors. 
4. What I Am Requesting : I request that XXXX XXXX correct their records and immediately update all relevant credit reporting agencies to remove the negative entries associated with this account, given that these entries were made due to their mistake. I also ask for written confirmation that these corrections have been made. 

Supporting Documents : A copy of the letter from XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/year>, confirming the loan was paid off. 
Records of communication with XXXX XXXX regarding the discrepancies and my prompt payment of the balance. 

5. Desired Resolution : I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter and ensure that XXXX XXXX corrects their error by updating my credit report to accurately reflect the resolution of this account as of XX/XX/year>, and remove all negative entries that were incorrectly reported. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance in resolving this issue.

This inaccurate information has been reported to the credit bureaus, and I am requesting an immediate correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). According to the FCRA, credit reporting agencies and creditors are required to report only accurate information. The specific late payments that I am disputing are listed as follows : - **Date of Late Payment : ** [ XX/XX/year> ] - and [ XX/XX/year> **Amount : ** [ {$30.00} ] These late payments are inaccurately reported and are causing undue harm to my credit score and overall financial reputation. Please note that under the FCRA, you are required to respond to this dispute within 15 days. I also request that any updates to my credit file resulting from this dispute be communicated to me in writing.

According to 15 USC 1666b, A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. If an open end consumer credit plan provides a time period within which an obligor may repay any portion of the credit extended without incurring an additional finance charge, such additional finance charge may not be imposed with respect to such portion of the credit extended for the billing cycle of which such period is a part, unless a statement which includes the amount upon which the finance charge for the period is based was mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the date specified in the statement by which payment must be made in order to avoid imposition of that finance charge.

16 CFR 313, also known as the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information rule, is a federal regulation that implements the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). It governs how financial institutions collect, use, and share consumers ' personal financial information. The rule requires institutions to provide privacy notices to customers, explaining how their data will be handled, and allows consumers to opt out of having their information shared with non-affiliated third parties.

According to 15 USC 1692b, except as provided in section 1692b of this title, without the prior consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector, or the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, or as reasonably necessary to effectuate a post-judgment judicial remedy, a debt collector may not communicate, in connection with the collection of any debt, with any person other than the consumer, his attorney, a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law, the creditor, the attorney of the creditor, or the attorney of the debt collector. I expect that you will investigate this matter promptly and correct the inaccuracies on my credit report. Failure to comply with this request may result in further actions. Please confirm in writing that these inaccuracies have been corrected or provide a detailed explanation if you believe the information is correct. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift resolution.

Re : Formal Dispute Under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602, Section 604, and 15 U.S.C. 1666b This dispute is made under 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), specifically Sections 602 and 604, as well as 15 U.S.C. 1666b ( Fair Credit Billing Act - Crediting of Payments ).

Basis for Dispute : 1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602 : Section 602 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes the need for credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate and fair credit reporting practices. The disputed information on my credit report is inaccurate and does not reflect the actual status of my account. This misinformation is damaging to my credit profile and violates the standards of accuracy required by law.

2. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 604 : Section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the permissible purposes for which a consumer report can be accessed. If this dispute involves unauthorized credit inquiries, these inquiries were not made with my consent or for a permissible purpose under the FCRA. These inquiries should not have been included on my credit report.

3. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1666b ( Fair Credit Billing Act - Crediting of Payments ) : Under 15 U.S.C. 1666b, payments must be credited to an account on the date of receipt. The payment listed on my account was not credited promptly, resulting in [ e.g., a late fee, increased interest, or a negative impact on my credit score ]. This delay is in violation of the Fair Credit Billing Act.

4. PAANL ( Principle of Accuracy and Non-Discrimination in Lending ) : The Principle of Accuracy and Non-Discrimination in Lending emphasizes that all information reported on consumer credit reports must be both accurate and free from bias or discrimination. The inaccurate or mishandled information in question violates these principles, potentially leading to unfair lending practices against me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30058,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10063325

Below are the details of the account in question : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date of Charge-Off : XX/XX/year> It has come to my attention that this charge-off is being reported repeatedly monthly, which is incorrect. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as a charge-off should be reported only once, reflecting the date it was charged off. 
Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off misrepresents my payment history and negatively impacts my credit score.

Furthermore, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the initial delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ).

Repeatedly reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reflect the statute of limitations and is therefore improper.

I request an immediate investigation into this matter and the correction of my credit report by removing the repeated entries of the charge-off from my payment history. Please update my credit report accordingly and provide written confirmation of these corrections.

Below are the details of the account in question : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date of Charge-Off : XX/XX/2020 It has come to my attention that this charge-off is being reported repeatedly monthly, which is incorrect. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as a charge-off should be reported only once, reflecting the date it was charged off. 
Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off misrepresents my payment history and negatively impacts my credit score.

Furthermore, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the initial delinque
ncy that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ).

Repeatedly reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reflect the statute of limitations and is therefore improper.

I request an immediate investigation into this matter and the correction of my credit report by removing the repeated entries of the charge-off from my payment history. Please update my credit report accordingly and provide written confirmation of these corrections.

Dear XXXX  Dispute Department, I am writing to formally dispute the following unauthorized or inaccurate inquires listed on my credit report. I have reviewed my credit report and found these inquiries were made without my consent or are inaccurate. The details of the inquires in question are as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, U.S. Code 1681 e ( b ) ACCURACY OF REPORT, & 15 U.S. CODE 1681 i ( 5 ) TREATMENT OF INACCURATE OR UNVERIFIABLE INFORMATION ( A ). 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). ONLY authorized inquires should appear on a consumers credit report. I have not applied for credit with the companies listed above, nor have I authorized these inquiries. Therefore, I am requesting that these inquires be DELETED FROM MY CREDIT REPORT. 

Enclosed with this letter are copies of my identification and a recent utility bill to verify my identity. I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and kindly request a written conformation once these inquires have been DELETED from my credit report.

Below are the details of the account in question : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date of Charge-Off : XX/XX/year> It has come to my attention that this charge-off is being reported repeatedly monthly, which is incorrect. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as a charge-off should be reported only once, reflecting the date it was charged off. 
Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off misrepresents my payment history and negatively impacts my credit score. 
Furthermore, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the initial delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ).

Repeatedly reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reflect the statute of limitations and is therefore improper.

Collections & Charge offs accounts over {$600.00} reporting to my consumer report is tax fraud. By Law companies are supposed to send me the consumer a copy of the 1099 from the accounts that has been charged off written as loss. The collection is now income by IRS law states that income can not be reported as debt. Please remove this account from my report this is against the law and is considered tax fraud. The account information listed directly above is inaccurate, and I dispute the validity of each. As per the FCRA you must delete all entries to my credit file that can not be proven to be accurate.

2024-09-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XXXX. Subject : Complaint Against Experian and XXXX for Refusal to Update Personal Information Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Experian and XXXX for their refusal to update my personal information on my credit report. On XX/XX/2024, I submitted a personal information update letter to Experian, requesting the correction of my address and other personal details. This letter was accompanied by the necessary documentation, including a copy of my driver 's license, Social Security card, and a utility bill to verify my address. The document was also notarized. 
However, on XX/XX/2024, I received a response from Experian stating that my request could not be processed because I did not provide a government ID. This statement is incorrect and misleading, as I had included all required documents, including a government-issued ID, in my initial submission. 
Attached to this complaint, you will find a copy of my original personal information update letter and all supporting documents that were submitted to Experian. 
I believe that Experian 's refusal to update my information is a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically under sections 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( Compliance procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy ).

Experian 's failure to acknowledge and properly review the provided documentation is a direct violation of my rights under the FCRA. According to the FCRA, consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate information on their credit reports and must be provided with a fair and reasonable investigation of their dispute. By ignoring the documentation I provided, XXXX has failed to uphold their obligation to conduct a fair investigation, thereby violating my consumer rights. 
I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and ensure that Experian updates my personal information as requested. Additionally, I seek confirmation that my credit report will reflect the accurate and updated information without further delays. 
Furthermore, I demand a deletion of all personally identifiable information from my consumer credit report with the exception of :",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30331,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10058966

This inconsistency can make it difficult for businesses operating across state lines to accurately assess creditworthiness.

2. **Data Accuracy Issues : ** Errors in credit reports can negatively impact individuals and businesses, leading to difficulties in obtaining loans, financing, or even employment. These errors can be time-consuming to correct, especially when dealing with multiple credit reporting agencies.

3. **Limited Access to Credit : ** Individuals and businesses in certain regions, particularly rural areas, may have limited access to credit due to factors like lack of local lenders or reliance on credit reporting agencies that are less familiar with their specific circumstances. 
XXXX. **Excessive Fees : ** Some credit reporting agencies charge fees for accessing credit reports or correcting errors, which can be a financial burden for individuals and businesses, especially those operating on a tight budget. 

These factors can hinder the smooth flow of goods, services, and capital across state lines, ultimately impacting the overall health of the economy. To address these issues, various regulations and initiatives have been implemented, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which provides consumers with certain rights regarding their credit reports.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,AK,996XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10063836

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as a charge-off should be reported only once, reflecting the date it was charged off.Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off misrepresents my payment history and negatively impacts my credit score. Furthermore, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the initial delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ). Repeatedly reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reflect the statute of limitations and is therefore improper.

These violations have caused significant harm to my financial status, disenfranchised me from fair credit opportunities, and infringed on my right to privacy.

Violations of 15 USC 1666b ( Credit Billing Act ) The credit reporting agencies have failed to provide timely corrections or deletions of disputed information, including negative and outdated entries, closed accounts, and inaccurate addresses. Despite my attempts to resolve these matters, they continue to report incorrect information without following proper procedures under this statute.

Violations of 15 USC 1691 and 12 CFR 1002 ( Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B ) XXXX, XXXX, and Experian have unlawfully shared my personal and financial information with banks, loan companies, and other institutions without my explicit written consent. These actions violate my rights under the ECOA and Regulation B, further restricting my access to credit and loans.

Violations of 15 USC 1692c ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ) These agencies have continued to share inaccurate information with third parties after I explicitly requested they cease such activity. This violates 15 USC 1692c, which governs the conduct of information sharing without the consumers consent, leading to ongoing financial hardship and privacy breaches. 

Violations of 15 USC 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ) XXXX, XXXX, and Experian have failed to comply with key provisions of the FCRA : 1681b They lacked permissible purposes to access or distribute my credit report and provided negative information without my authorization.

1681e They did not follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information reported, resulting in negative entries that I have previously disputed.

1681c The agencies failed to remove outdated and inaccurate information, including closed accounts and former addresses.

1681n & 1681o These agencies willfully and negligently failed to comply with the FCRA, resulting in ongoing financial harm to me.

Violations of 15 USC 6801 ( XXXX XXXX ) The agencies violated the XXXX XXXX by failing to protect my nonpublic personal information, sharing it with third parties without my explicit consent, and not providing me with the necessary protections outlined under 6801. 

Violations of 15 USC 45 ( FTC Act ) Their actions constitute unfair and deceptive practices under the FTC Act ( 15 USC 45 ). The continued unauthorized dissemination of my negative and inaccurate information to third parties violates this statute.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,WI,53208,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10064428

Despite being verified, the bankruptcy entry remains a clear and direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I urge a thorough re-investigation and immediate removal of this incorrect entry. 
US BANKRUPTCY COURT Account Number : XXXX XXXX. Persistent Inaccuracy Despite Verification : The bankruptcy entry on my credit report is inaccurate. Despite my previous complaint and the so-called verification process, this error persists. This not only causes substantial harm to my financial status but also undermines my rights under the FCRA. 

2. Re-Evaluation of Privacy Rights Under FCRA : Under 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( 4 ), I am entitled to privacy and accuracy in my credit reporting. Re-reporting and verifying flawed information without thorough investigation contravene this statutory protection.

3. Questionable Permissible Purpose : According to 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), consumer reporting agencies must have a verifiable permissible purpose to disclose my credit information. The maintenance and dissemination of inaccurate bankruptcy information do not meet this requirement and imply a serious oversight in due diligence.

4. Inadequate Re-investigation Process : The current verification does not align with the requirements of 15 U.S. Code S 1681 ( a ), which mandates a comprehensive and meaningful re-investigation of disputed information. The inadequate and superficial verification process has perpetuated this critical error on my credit report.

The persistence of this erroneous bankruptcy entry on my credit report despite prior verification is unacceptable and a clear violation of FCRA. I trust that the CFPB will prioritize this follow-up complaint, enforce compliance with FCRA regulations , and guarantee a swift and fair resolution.

Below are the details of the account in question : Creditor Name : [ XXXX ] Account Number : [ XXXX ] Date of Charge-Off : [ XX/XX/year> It has come to my attention that this charge-off is being reported repeatedly monthly, which is incorrect.

Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off misrepresents my payment history and negatively impacts my credit score.

Furthermore, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the initial delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ).

2024-09-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Public record information inaccurate,"XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Subject : Formal Request for Re-investigation and Removal of Incorrect Bankruptcy Listing on Credit Report I am writing to follow up on my previous complaint regarding the inaccurate reporting of a bankruptcy on my credit report by [ EXPERIAN ). Despite being verified, the bankruptcy entry remains a clear and direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I urge a thorough re-investigation and immediate removal of this incorrect entry. 
US BANKRUPTCY COURT Account Number : XXXX XXXX. Persistent Inaccuracy Despite Verification : The bankruptcy entry on my credit report is inaccurate. Despite my previous complaint and the so-called verification process, this error persists. This not only causes substantial harm to my financial status but also undermines my rights under the FCRA. 

2. Re-Evaluation of Privacy Rights Under FCRA : Under 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( 4 ), I am entitled to privacy and accuracy in my credit reporting. Re-reporting and verifying flawed information without thorough investigation contravene this statutory protection.

3. Questionable Permissible Purpose : According to 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), consumer reporting agencies must have a verifiable permissible purpose to disclose my credit information. The maintenance and dissemination of inaccurate bankruptcy information do not meet this requirement and imply a serious oversight in due diligence.

4. Inadequate Re-investigation Process : The current verification does not align with the requirements of 15 U.S. Code S 1681 ( a ), which mandates a comprehensive and meaningful re-investigation of disputed information. The inadequate and superficial verification process has perpetuated this critical error on my credit report.

The persistence of this erroneous bankruptcy entry on my credit report despite prior verification is unacceptable and a clear violation of FCRA. I trust that the CFPB will prioritize this follow-up complaint, enforce compliance with FCRA regulations , and guarantee a swift and fair resolution.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.

1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Sec 1681s-2, that the Credit Reporting Agency could be reporting Unauthorized and Fraudulent Credit Inquiries by these Original Creditors on my credit report and is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 604 ( a ) ,604 ( b ), 604 ( c ), 609, and 623 ( a ) ( 6 ) ( 8 ) and Fair Credit Billing Act, and Title 15 U.S.C. section 1681b ( a ), 1681b ( b ), 1681b ( c ), All data on My Credit Report must be 100 % ACCURATE, 100 % VERIFIABLE, and 100 % TIMELY, or By Law can not be on My Credit Report. PERIOD, per Sec 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ).

I recently reviewed my credit report and found unauthorized inquiries.

I contacted the below creditors, and they have NO proof I initiated such inquiries, nor written authorization and have failed to provide any permissible purpose. Since, they do not have my authorization, written nor verbal, I ask that you DELETE these authorized inquiries from my credit report immediately as there is no evidence of any authorization, nor any permissible purpose.

Inquiries are not a matter of record when I never gave these companies access to My credit file!!

According to Section 604 of Fair Credit Reporting Act Permissible Purposes of Consumer Reports 15 U.S. Code 1681b In general. Subject to subsection ( e ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other.

( F ) otherwise has a legitimate business need for the information i ) in connection with a business transaction that is initiated by the consumer.

The collection is now income by IRS law states that income can not be reported as debt. Please remove this account from my report this is against the law and is considered tax fraud.

2024-09-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Public record information inaccurate,"I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate reporting of a child support account on my consumer report. The account in question, identified by the account number XXXX, XXXX is being reported with discrepancies across XXXX, Experian, and XXXX, as shown in the attached documentation. Due to these inconsistencies, I believe this account should be removed from my credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and relevant case law. This account is also listed 3 times with the the same account number this can not be correct and each consumer agency knows listing this account this way is lower my score on purpose. This account should not be listed three times.

The FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ) mandates that furnishers of information provide only accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies. In this case, the child support account is being reported differently across multiple agencies. The inconsistent reporting violates the accuracy requirement of the FCRA. Specifically, the account shows different balances, statuses, and payment histories, which create confusion and result in an inaccurate representation of my financial obligations. 

Moreover, under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the court ruled that inaccurate or incomplete credit reporting violates a consumers rights under the FCRA. Since this account is not being reported accurately and consistently, it is imperative that this inaccurate entry be removed to avoid further damage to my credit profile.

I respectfully request that you : 1. Investigate the reported inaccuracies in the child support account.

2. Remove the inaccurate entry from my credit report.

3. Provide written confirmation once the deletion has been completed.

Please consider this a formal dispute under the FCRA, and I expect a full investigation and correction to be completed within 30 days, as required by law. I have enclosed a copy of my credit report with the disputed information highlighted for your reference. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

These violations have caused significant harm to my financial status, disenfranchised me from fair credit opportunities, and infringed on my right to privacy.

Violations of 15 USC 1666b ( Credit Billing Act ) The credit reporting agencies have failed to provide timely corrections or deletions of disputed information, including negative and outdated entries, closed accounts, and inaccurate addresses. Despite my attempts to resolve these matters, they continue to report incorrect information without following proper procedures under this statute. 

Violations of 15 USC 1691 and 12 CFR 1002 ( Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B ) XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX have unlawfully shared my personal and financial information with banks, loan companies, and other institutions without my explicit written consent. These actions violate my rights under the ECOA and Regulation B, further restricting my access to credit and loans. 

Violations of 15 USC 1692c ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ) These agencies have continued to share inaccurate information with third parties after I explicitly requested they cease such activity. This violates 15 USC 1692c, which governs the conduct of information sharing without the consumers consent, leading to ongoing financial hardship and privacy breaches. 

Violations of 15 USC 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ) XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX have failed to comply with key provisions of the FCRA : 1681b They lacked permissible purposes to access or distribute my credit report and provided negative information without my authorization.

1681e They did not follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information reported, resulting in negative entries that I have previously disputed.

1681c The agencies failed to remove outdated and inaccurate information, including closed accounts and former addresses.

1681n & 1681o These agencies willfully and negligently failed to comply with the FCRA, resulting in ongoing financial harm to me. 
Violations of 15 USC 6801 ( XXXX XXXX ) The agencies violated the XXXX XXXX by failing to protect my nonpublic personal information, sharing it with third parties without my explicit consent, and not providing me with the necessary protections outlined under 6801.

Violations of 15 USC 45 ( FTC Act ) Their actions constitute unfair and deceptive practices under the FTC Act ( 15 USC 45 ). The continued unauthorized dissemination of my negative and inaccurate information to third parties violates this statute.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",WI,53208,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10064247

This letter serves as a follow-up to a complaint I filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX CFPB ) on XXXX XXXX XXXX  regarding your continued reporting of this debt in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). The CFPB complaint number is XXXX 

XXXXAccount Information XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX - Amount : {$6100.00} As stated in my previous communication, under section 805 ( c ) of the FDCPA, once a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that they refuse to pay a debt or wish for the debt collector to cease communication, the debt collector must immediately cease all communication, including reporting the debt to credit reporting agencies. The only permissible exceptions to this rule are : XXXX. Advising the consumer that the debt collectors efforts are being terminated ; 2. Notifying the consumer that the debt collector or creditor may invoke specific remedies ordinarily invoked by such debt collectors or creditors ; 3. Where applicable, notifying the consumer that the debt collector or creditor intends to invoke a specific remedy. 

To date, I have not received any such notifications. Despite my prior request and the complaint filed with the CFPB, Genesis Credit Management LLC continues to report this account to credit reporting agencies, which is a clear violation of the FDCPA. 

I demand that you immediately remove this account from all credit reporting agencies and cease any further communication regarding this debt. Failure to comply will result in further legal action, including, but not limited to, escalating my complaint with the CFPB and seeking damages for continued violations of my rights under the FDCPA.

This took place within a window period of XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/2024. 

This illegal process inevitably caused my XXXX XXXX XXXX to drop XXXX points causing me financial distress. 

This illegal process of removing a account has a direct effect on the credit report due to its direct effect on the algorithm of age, credit utilization, inquiries etc The account which was removed and reopened as stated on credit karma were : 1. CURRENT INQUIRIES : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The credit karma report states that the CURRENT account was removed and instantly reopened. 

It still reports as being a closed on CREDIT KARMA. While CURRENT has reassured me that such account was never closed from their end.

However, CREDIT KARMA nor XXXX reported the positive balance of the CURRENT credit card payment which would have increased my credit score rather reduce its points.

The credit karma report also states that the aforementioned CREDIT INQUIRIES were removed then replaced as new credit inquiries.

However, when reviewing the accounts mentioned above, all the dates highlight the original date these items was placed on my credit report. This clearly demonstrates that there a manufacturing error deliberately aimed to harm my score.

These activities listed above has direct effects on the point system of consumers credit reports.

2024-09-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Experian Subject : Notice of Dispute for Failure to Investigate and Breach of Performance FINAL NOTICE I am writing to formally notify Experian of several violations of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) in connection with a dispute I previously filed and the failure of your company to properly address and investigate the matter. 

On or about XX/XX/year>, I sent Experian an Affidavit of Truth, outlining my demands concerning the inaccurate information present in my credit report. Not only did Experian fail to meet the demands of this Affidavit, but I did not receive a proper response to the dispute within the required timeframe. This lack of response constitutes a **breach of performance** on your part, as well as a violation of my rights under the FCRA. 

**FCRA Violations : ** 1. **Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : ** Experian has failed to conduct a reasonable investigation as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ). Despite the submission of my Affidavit of Truth, you have not properly investigated or responded to my dispute.

2. **Failure to Provide Verification Information : ** Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ), Experian is required to provide the name and contact information of the person or entity that allegedly verified the disputed information. I have not received any such information, which further demonstrates a failure to comply with the FCRA.

3. **Reporting of Inaccurate Information : ** The data in question, provided by a third-party data furnisher, continues to be reported inaccurately, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). This data furnisher is a third party, and third-party information is by definition "" hearsay '' unless verified by proper sources.

The "" data furnisher '' is an **interloper**, a party not authorized to be involved in my personal credit matters. As defined, an interloper is someone who becomes involved in a place or situation where they are neither wanted nor belong. The data furnisher has no lawful standing to report any information on my credit report, as there is no contract or agreement with my signature authorizing such reporting. Furthermore, there is **no court order** permitting this information to be included in my report, and I have not authorized any release of my personal information in writing. 

In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed key issues related to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The case dealt with the responsibility of a data furnisher ( XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) to correct inaccurate credit information after being notified of a dispute by a credit reporting agency ( CRA ).

Experians failure to comply with these obligations under the FCRA is unacceptable. I demand that the inaccurate information in question be immediately extracted from my credit report. I also request that you provide the name and contact details of the person who allegedly verified the disputed information. 

Failure to respond and act in accordance with your obligations under the FCRA will leave me no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies to enforce my rights. 

This notice is supported by recent legal actions against Experian, such as the class action lawsuit settled for {$22.00} XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California ) , where Experian was found to have violated FCRA by continuing to report inaccurate information despite consumer disputes.

( C ) the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. 


XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I would like to forge forward with a righted disputation that I see you currently have on my consumer report, possibly causing violating infringements and injury to my credibility. Eradicate any and all of these following unproven genuine, FCRA compliant, and or applicable standards of reporting of which you are undoubtedly mandated in your reporting obligation ( s ) to obey without default or deficiency of any sort. 

The FCRA 's permissible purpose provisions are thus central to the statute 's protection of consumer privacy. 

In accord with 5 U.S. Code 552a - Records maintained on individuals ( b ) Conditions of Disclosure.No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record would be. 

15 U.S. Code 1681- Congressional findings and statement of purpose ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. 

( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.

( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy.

15 U.S. Code 1681a - Definitions ; rules of construction ( d ) Consumer Report. 

( 1 ) In general.The term consumer report means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumers credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumers eligibility for ( A ) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes ; 12 CFR Part 1022 - Fair Credit Reporting ( Regulation V ) FCRA section 607 ( a ) requires that consumer reporting companies, among other things, must require that prospective users of consumer reports certify the purposes for which the information is sought, and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose. 

Consumers suffer harm when consumer reporting agencies provide consumer reports to persons who are not authorized to receive the information or when recipients of consumer reports obtain or use such reports for purposes other than permissible purposes. These harms include the invasion of my ' privacy, as well as reputational, emotional, physical, and economic harms. 

12 CFR Part 1022 - Fair Credit Reporting ( Regulation V ) permissible purpose provisions to the protection of consumer privacy, the Bureau is issuing this advisory opinion to affirm that consumer reporting agencies may not provide a consumer report pursuant to FCRA section 604 ( a ) under any circumstance not expressly permitted by this section. 

A consumer reporting company may not provide a consumer report under FCRA section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) unless it has reason to believe that the user has a permissible purpose with respect to the consumer about whom the report is requested. A user 's request to a consumer reporting company for a report about a consumer does not give the consumer reporting company a reason to believe that the user has a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer report about other consumers. As explained in part I.A, Congress enacted the FCRA in part to address a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with... a respect for the consumer 's right to privacy. 

FCRA section 619 imposes criminal liability on any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses.

The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, protects individuals ' personal information from unwarranted invasions of privacy. 

( g ) ( 1 ) Civil Remedies.Whenever any agency ( A ) makes a determination under subsection ( d ) ( 3 ) of this section not to amend an individuals record in accordance with his request, or fails to make such review in conformity with that subsection ; the individual may bring a civil action against the agency, and the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction in the matters under the provisions of this subsection. 

( 4 ) In any suit brought under the provisions of subsection ( g ) ( 1 ) ( C ) or ( D ) of this section in which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful, the United States shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of ( A ) actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of {$1000.00} The enforcement of the regulations prescribed there under shell be enforced by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,VA,23434,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,In progress,Yes,,10064059

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as a charge-off should be reported only once, reflecting the date it was charged off.Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ).

Repeatedly reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reflect the statute of limitations and is therefore improper.

I am requesting your credit bureau to initiate an investigation and to determine responsible parties in this unauthorized credit inquiry. As part of your investigation, please send the names, business addresses, and phone numbers of those who made unauthorized credit inquiries so I may contact them directly. In addition, I respectfully request a copy of any documents authorizing credit inquiry, and signed on my behalf, so that I may verify its validity. If you find that I was not the one who authorized this inquiry, I ask that it be removed immediately from my credit file.

Despite my initial communication and your acknowledgment of the dispute, the disputed items have not been adequately resolved. Therefore, I am compelled to escalate the matter and request a resolution through arbitration, as provided for in Experians arbitration agreement.

I am aware that under Experians arbitration agreement, Experian is responsible for paying half of the arbitration fee. However, considering the substantial costs associated with the arbitration process, I am providing Experian with an opportunity to avoid these expenses altogether. In addition to the request for a comprehensive investigation and resolution of the disputed items, I propose the following settlement offer : XXXX.

To settle this matter expeditiously and avoid the significant costs and time involved in formal arbitration proceedings, I request that Experian pay me the full amount of the arbitration initiation fee. 
I believe that this settlement offer reflects a fair and reasonable resolution, taking into account the costs Experian would otherwise incur during the arbitration process. Accepting this offer would spare both parties the financial burden and extensive time commitment associated with formal arbitration. 
Potential Costs of Arbitration : Should this dispute not be resolved amicably, please be aware of the following potential costs associated with arbitration : Arbitration Filing Fees : [ {$4000.00} ] Legal Fees : [ {$10000.00} ] Administrative Costs : [ XXXX ] Time and Effort Compensation : Possible claim amount of {$5000.00} for time spent addressing the dispute. 

Total Potential Costs : [ {$20000.00} ] The initiation of arbitration can incur significant costs, which I am fully aware of. However, to avoid the expense and inconvenience of arbitration for both parties, I am prepared to settle this matter with the following one-time offer : Settlement Amount : [ {$4000.00} ] Removal of the following Inaccurate accounts from My Credit Report Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX {$1200.00} Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX {$980.00} Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX {$5500.00} Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Furthermore, it is important to note that should Experian decline this settlement offer XXXX I will pursue the arbitration process as provided for in Experians arbitration agreement.

Upon doing so, I had noticed there were several inquiries that I had no knowledge of nor had given each of those financial institutions any permission to pull my credit at any point in my life so far. With this information in hand, I sent out a letter by certified mail to Experian on XX/XX/year> in which I stated that there were erroneous inquiries on my credit report that did not have permissable permission from me to exist on my credit report. Additionally, I requested that those listed inquiries be investigated and removed due to them being unauthorized by me. ( please see attached letter that was sent ). I patiently waited 30 days per FCRA rules for a response and never received one. Recently, on XX/XX/year>, I opened my Experian app to track my credit growth and progress to which point I discovered XXXX new hard inquiries that are titled as follows : "" XXXX XXXX, '' "" XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX '' and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' I do not know who the associated financial institutions are nor do I give authorized permission for them to pull my credit for any purposes. 
I've given Experian more than alloted time per FCRA rules to properly investigate and rectify these errors and yet there hasn't been any resolve rendered. In mention of this, I had in turn send them yet another certified letter on XX/XX/year> ( please see attached ) in which I requested resolution to be executed for failure to comply with FCRA policy to which they are governed by for not responding in 30 days.

2024-09-08,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","I reached out a few months ago as loan care had not paid my homeowners insurance for the year that they had had my loan. upon reaching out to them they told me that there was no money in my escrow account for the insurance and if I wanted them to pay it, I would need to pay about {$1200.00}. I told them that on my closing paperwork it shows that I am paying homeowners insurance each month to go into an escrow account to be paid by them. For weeks different employees would tell me that I was misinformed and there was nothing they could do. Finally, I talked with an employee who saw my closing paperwork, admitted they were wrong and said they would have it fixed right away. They then paid my homeowners insurance from escrow and I never heard back. It is now two months later, my property taxes have not gone up Since the last time loan care increase my payment {$100.00} to account for the property tax increase. Yet, when I went to pay this month, it shows that I am now paying additionally into an escrow account for my homeowners insurance. This is the exact amount they told me I would have to pay when they all said I was not paying in the first place. Through all this, I never received a check for what would have been left over As the gentleman I got my mortgage through in the first place said I should have been if they werent paying my insurance. As he set my paperwork up and knew That the homeowners insurance was in fact set up to go into an escrow account. Loan care doing this shows that they miss allocated my funds in the first place, Did not disperse them back to me, and has now raised my payments again to cover the mistake they made in the first place. This company is practicing in bad faith, seems to be misallocating funds, and is overall robbing their clients.

My personal information was compromised in the breach, leading to significant issues, including fraudulent charges and unauthorized withdrawals from my XXXX XXXX account. I have provided them all requested documentation, and I have proof from the Equifax settlement website confirming that I was directly impacted by the breach. 

Despite fulfilling all the necessary requirements and submitting the requested information, Equifax has not released the compensation owed to me for the damages I suffered. This delay has caused unnecessary hardship, and I believe it is unfair and unacceptable that Equifax has not yet paid out the settlement funds. 

I request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring that Equifax honors their commitment and promptly releases the compensation I am owed. Thank you for your kind attention to this matter!

2024-09-08,Debt collection,Rental debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"Beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, I notified my apartment complex, XXXX XXXX XXXX, that I would be moving out a few days earlier than listed on my lease. I communicated that I noticed that the amount owed for rent listed on my account did not reflect the prorated amount discussed and promised by my apartment. I was told via email to not worry, and they would fix it. I emailed 2 more times about this in XX/XX/XXXX. 

The next series of emails regarded a final request for an accurate amount to be paid to the apartment complex, but I did not hear back from anyone. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a bill for the correct amount after a couple of months of silence and no communication regarding the return of my security deposit. 

I communicated to my apartment that I did not feel this was scrupulous on their part, as I had moved on assuming that they wrote me off due to the lack of communication, along with 3 separate incidents regarding car theft and break ins on site. 

I did not receive any communication from my apartment complex in months to follow, but received my first collections notice in the spring of XXXX. I began contacting XXXX XXXX XXXX and finally received a responsive phonecall from a leasing manager on XX/XX/XXXX. This manager agreed that the money was too late to collect and said she would take care of the balance and contact the collections agency on my behalf. I assumed this is what occurred, until I received yet another collections notice in XX/XX/XXXX. I assumed it was erroneous, but I responded to the email and said the apartment complex already addressed this and I do not owe any money. I also reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX and forwarded the collections email and asked them to follow up. I never received communication back. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, the collections notice is visible on my credit card account, and it is fraudulent based on negligence of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) staff. I am formally disputing the balance as of today, XX/XX/XXXX.",,"Rowland Avenue Management, Inc.

I have provided them all requested documentation, and I have proof from the Equifax settlement website confirming that I was directly impacted by the breach. 

Despite fulfilling all the necessary requirements and submitting the requested information, Equifax has not released the compensation owed to me for the damages I suffered. This delay has caused unnecessary hardship, and I believe it is unfair and unacceptable that Equifax has not yet paid out the settlement funds.

Below are the details of the account in question : Creditor Name : [ XXXX ] Account Number : [ XXXX ] Date of Charge-Off : [ XX/XX/2018 It has come to my attention that this charge-off is being reported repeatedly monthly, which is incorrect. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as a charge-off should be reported only once, reflecting the date it was charged off. 
Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off misrepresents my payment history and negatively impacts my credit score. 
Furthermore, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the initial delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ).

Repeatedly reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reflect the statute of limitations and is therefore improper. 
Trequest an immediate investigation into this matter and the correction of my credit report by removing the repeated entries of the charge-off from my payment history. Please update my credit report accordingly and provide written confirmation of these corrections.

These accounts have violated my federally protected consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and have infringed upon my right to privacy and confidentiality as outlined under 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( 2 ). 
The accounts in question are as follows : XXXX. Account Name : XXXX XXXX  Account Number : # XXXX High Balance Discrepancy : XXXX shows {$0.00} while XXXX and Equifax report {$3100.00}.

XXXX. Account Name : XXXX  Account Number : # XXXX High Balance Discrepancy : XXXX shows {$0.00}, while XXXX and Equifax report {$2600.00} and {$2100.00}, respectively. Date of Last Activity Discrepancy : Dates vary significantly between bureaus. Date Reported Error : Equifax reports an incorrect future date.

According to 15 U.S.C. 1681, Section 602 ( a ), I have the right to privacy, which has been compromised by the reporting of these accounts. Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 1681b states that a consumer reporting agency can not furnish any account information without my explicit written instructions, which were not provided for the accounts listed above.

Additionally, as per 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ), no consumer reporting agency may include any adverse item of information, other than records of convictions of crimes, that predates the report by more than seven years. This stipulation has been ignored in the reporting of these accounts, causing significant harm to my credit profile.

Moreover, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) mandates that a person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. Despite notifying the concerned parties of the inaccuracies in these accounts, the erroneous information continues to be reported, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ). 
Given these violations, I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) take immediate action to : XXXX. Reinvestigate the accounts listed above in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
XXXX. Ensure that any inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information is corrected or deleted. 
XXXX. Provide me with a copy of the updated credit report reflecting these corrections. 
Please be advised that failure to comply with the FCRA could result in further legal action to protect my rights as a consumer.

I also filed a dispute with the XXXX credit bureaus regarding the incorrect reporting by Capital One. 

Now on my credit report is has been updated to a charge off. When I paid as agreed. Have proof of payments via my XXXX statements, and an email from Capital One indicating successful receipt of payments. 

It's unfortunate and disappointing how Capital One went about doing business. Even more so, to lead clients on regarding payment plans and credit reporting when done as agreed to then give the harshest report when it was repaid as agreed. 

It is not worth the effort to negotiate a full repayment with Capital One if as agreed it is identified as a charge off. It's best to not repay, let it go to collections and then offer to settle at pennies on the dollar-for the impact a full repayment plan listed as charge off can impact your credit report.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,IL,60615,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10051775

Basis for Dispute : 1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602 : Section 602 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes the need for credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate and fair credit reporting practices. The disputed information on my credit report is inaccurate and does not reflect the actual status of my account.

2. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 604 : Section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the permissible purposes for which a consumer report can be accessed. If this dispute involves unauthorized credit inquiries, these inquiries were not made with my consent or for a permissible purpose under the FCRA.

3. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1666b ( Fair Credit Billing Act - Crediting of Payments ) : Under 15 U.S.C. 1666b, payments must be credited to an account on the date of receipt.

This charge-off was incorrectly applied, and the account 's current derogatory status is not a true reflection of my financial responsibility. This inaccurate reporting is unfairly damaging my credit standing, even though the account has been fully resolved. 

I am requesting the CFPBs assistance in having this account removed from my credit report, as it should not have been charged off in the first place and is now fully paid. Please take the necessary steps to address this inaccurate reporting and ensure that my credit report reflects the correct status. 

Thank you for your help in resolving this matter.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 Responsibilities of furnishers of information. The inquiry should have been thoroughly verified before being reported. TransUnion has failed in this responsibility.

Violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) Under 15 U.S.C. 6802-6805, I have the right to opt-out of sharing my nonpublic personal information with third parties. The unauthorized inquiry is in direct violation of these provisions, as I did not grant permission for my information to be shared or accessed by any third party.

Privacy Act of 1974 and ECOA Violations In addition to the above violations, the unauthorized inquiry breaches the Privacy Act of 1974 by mishandling my private information, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), which requires fair and non-discriminatory access to credit information.

FTC Report Filed I have already reported this issue to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) on [ XX/XX/XXXX ], and my case number is [ XXXX ]. This report further substantiates my claim that my identity may have been compromised, and unauthorized activity has occurred on my credit report.

Request for Immediate Action I request the CFPBs intervention to ensure that TransUnion immediately removes these unauthorized and unrecognizable inquiries from my credit report. Their actions have impacted my creditworthiness, and this issue needs urgent attention.

I trust that the CFPB will thoroughly investigate this matter and take all necessary steps to ensure my rights are upheld. Please keep me informed of your progress regarding this complaint.

2024-09-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Public record information inaccurate,"XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX Subject : Formal Request for Re-investigation and Removal of Incorrect Bankruptcy Listing on Credit Report I am writing to follow up on my previous complaint regarding the inaccurate reporting of a bankruptcy on my credit report by [ TRANSUNION ). Despite being verified, the bankruptcy entry remains a clear and direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I urge a thorough re-investigation and immediate removal of this incorrect entry. 
US BANKRUPTCY COURT Account Number : XXXX XXXX. Persistent Inaccuracy Despite Verification : The bankruptcy entry on my credit report is inaccurate. Despite my previous complaint and the so-called verification process, this error persists. This not only causes substantial harm to my financial status but also undermines my rights under the FCRA. 

2. Re-Evaluation of Privacy Rights Under FCRA : Under 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( 4 ), I am entitled to privacy and accuracy in my credit reporting. Re-reporting and verifying flawed information without thorough investigation contravene this statutory protection.

3. Questionable Permissible Purpose : According to 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), consumer reporting agencies must have a verifiable permissible purpose to disclose my credit information. The maintenance and dissemination of inaccurate bankruptcy information do not meet this requirement and imply a serious oversight in due diligence.

4. Inadequate Re-investigation Process : The current verification does not align with the requirements of 15 U.S. Code S 1681 ( a ), which mandates a comprehensive and meaningful re-investigation of disputed information. The inadequate and superficial verification process has perpetuated this critical error on my credit report.

The persistence of this erroneous bankruptcy entry on my credit report despite prior verification is unacceptable and a clear violation of FCRA. I trust that the CFPB will prioritize this follow-up complaint, enforce compliance with FCRA regulations , and guarantee a swift and fair resolution.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.

Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off misrepresents my payment history and negatively impacts my credit score. 
Furthermore, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the initial delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ).

Repeatedly reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reflect the statute of limitations and is therefore improper.

2024-09-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Public record information inaccurate,"I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate reporting of a child support account on my consumer report. The account in question, identified by the account number XXXX, XXXX is being reported with discrepancies across XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax, as shown in the attached documentation. Due to these inconsistencies, I believe this account should be removed from my credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and relevant case law. This account is also listed 3 times with the the same account number this can not be correct and each consumer agency knows listing this account this way is lower my score on purpose. This account should not be listed three times. 

The FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ) mandates that furnishers of information provide only accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies. In this case, the child support account is being reported differently across multiple agencies. The inconsistent reporting violates the accuracy requirement of the FCRA. Specifically, the account shows different balances, statuses, and payment histories, which create confusion and result in an inaccurate representation of my financial obligations. 

Moreover, under Richardson v. Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, the court ruled that inaccurate or incomplete credit reporting violates a consumers rights under the FCRA. Since this account is not being reported accurately and consistently, it is imperative that this inaccurate entry be removed to avoid further damage to my credit profile. 

I respectfully request that you : XXXX. Investigate the reported inaccuracies in the child support account. 
XXXX. Remove the inaccurate entry from my credit report. 
XXXX. Provide written confirmation once the deletion has been completed. 

Please consider this a formal dispute under the FCRA, and I expect a full investigation and correction to be completed within 30 days, as required by law. I have enclosed a copy of my credit report with the disputed information highlighted for your reference.

Despite fulfilling all the necessary requirements and submitting the requested information, Equifax has not released the compensation owed to me for the damages I suffered. This delay has caused unnecessary hardship, and I believe it is unfair and unacceptable that Equifax has not yet paid out the settlement funds.

Re : Formal Dispute Under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602, Section 604, and 15 U.S.C. 1666b This dispute is made under 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), specifically Sections 602 and 604, as well as 15 U.S.C. 1666b ( Fair Credit Billing Act - Crediting of Payments ). 
Basis for Dispute : 1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602 : Section 602 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes the need for credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate and fair credit reporting practices. The disputed information on my credit report is inaccurate and does not reflect the actual status of my account. This misinformation is damaging to my credit profile and violates the standards of accuracy required by law. 
2. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 604 : Section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the permissible purposes for which a consumer report can be accessed. If this dispute involves unauthorized credit inquiries, these inquiries were not made with my consent or for a permissible purpose under the FCRA. These inquiries should not have been included on my credit report. 
3. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1666b ( Fair Credit Billing Act - Crediting of Payments ) : Under 15 U.S.C. 1666b, payments must be credited to an account on the date of receipt. The payment listed on my account was not credited promptly, resulting in [ e.g., a late fee, increased interest, or a negative impact on my credit score ]. This delay is in violation of the Fair Credit Billing Act. 
4. PAANL ( Principle of Accuracy and Non-Discrimination in Lending ) : The Principle of Accuracy and Non-Discrimination in Lending emphasizes that all information reported on consumer credit reports must be both accurate and free from bias or discrimination. The inaccurate or mishandled information in question violates these principles, potentially leading to unfair lending practices against me.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30058,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10063326

My calls and proposals continuously go unanswered, until suddenly, Im being served paperwork for a lawsuit. I was served once ; and contacted them immediately to resolve this. They do not keep up with clients at all, they do not have autopay for payment plans, they do not send monthly bills or payment reminders, they do not send monthly statements, therefore keeping tracking of payments and due dates is impossible due to the lack of infrastructure on their website. The second time I found out they were suing me, they had gotten a judgement against me to levy my bank account- I was not notified of any delinquent payments on my plan, I was not notified of the new lawsuit, I was not notified of the bank levy, I was only made aware by a law firm offering their legal services to me with the public record from the local courthouse. I notified them immediately that they did not have the right to levy my account as it is shared with a third party, and has protected funds in it. They instead opted to pursue another payment plan. I have repeatedly proposed and called and sent letters about settling the debt- with no answer. They have not properly notified me of my debts in the amount or status of the debt and have also failed to notify me of pursuing legal action. They are unresponsive to most requests and this seems to be a common complaint amongst their XXXX reviews. 
The photo below shows XXXX occasions I was supposedly served on- XXXX of which ( XX/XX/year> ) which is incorrect. I was never served or notified of a bank levy.",,"Harpeth Financial Services, LLC",TN,37087,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10062458

Under contract law, transparency is required, and as the consumer, I should have been informed that my contract was being used for monetary gain on your end. The failure to disclose this critical information constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation. You did not inform me that my liability would be transferred while you benefited from cash advances using my contract as collateral. 

I demand immediate action to address this fraudulent practice, including removing any negative reports associated with this account from my credit report and providing a complete breakdown of how my contract has been used.

As the accounts which are listed in this letter are my personal information and you DO NOT HAVE MY PERMISSION to report any of it.

Since your company has taken upon itself to act as my entrusted fiduciary. I have provided you with the instructions to act on my behalf as to what serves my best interest. Failure to do so will result in a federal suit to the fullest extent including compensation based on the FRA section 29.

'' On XXXX, I submitted a comprehensive request to Equifax to reinvestigate inaccuracies on my credit report and to provide a detailed description of the verification methods used. However, Equifax rejected my request, stating that proper identification was not provided. 
I strongly believe that this rejection is unwarranted and constitutes a procedural failure on the part of Equifax. Enclosed with my original request were the following documents : 1. A signed and dated dispute letter outlining the inaccuracies on my credit report.

2. Copies of my credit reports from XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax highlighting the disputed items. 
3. A copy of my government-issued identification ( driver 's license ).

Violations of Law I believe that XXXX 's rejection of my request and the subsequent delay violate my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically : 1. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ) : This section requires that credit reporting agencies conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information.

Soon afterwards, the rates did drop but since I was already a month behind, I didnt qualify for the streamline program. What put me a month behind was that the department of defense began garnishing my wages for $ XXXX a month until an erroneous debt was reclaimed that totaled less than $ XXXX. Just before they began taking the money, I received a letter stating that I didnt owe it. When I took that letter to finance, they told me that theyd have to finish taking out all the money before I could apply for it to be refunded. After 6 months, I did apply for the refund and it was all refunded 3 months later. I explained this to Wells Fargo Bank and attempted to work something out but by that time, their offer was too much to pay. I kept them informed of the situation leading up to the reimbursement. Ive had traumatic nightmares about this for years.

I am requesting proof that I am indeed the party you are asking to pay this debt, and there is some contractual obligation that is binding on me to pay this debt.

If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested in the following declaration, I will require 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with legal counsel for suit. This includes any listing of any information to a credit- reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated. If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately.

'' After reviewing my credit report, I have found the following significant discrepancies between the credit bureaus TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX : TransUnion : Highest reported balance : {$2500.00} Current balance owed : {$2300.00} Payment status : Closed, reported as "" Charged off. '' XXXX : Highest reported balance : {$0.00} Current balance owed : {$2300.00} Payment status : Closed, reported as "" Charged off. '' The account was closed due to inactivity. 

XXXX : Highest reported balance : {$2300.00} Current balance owed : {$2300.00} Payment status : Closed, reported as "" Charged off, '' with the balance reported as a "" loss by the creditor. '' These discrepancies show serious inconsistencies, particularly regarding the reported balances and the reasons for the account closure. XXXX states that the account was closed due to inactivity, while XXXX indicates that the balance was reported as a loss. TransUnion reports a higher balance than the other bureaus. These inconsistencies violate the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ), which requires credit agencies to maintain maximum possible accuracy in their reports.

Additionally, under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1601 ), I am entitled to clear and accurate information about my credit obligations and payment history. The discrepancies noted affect the truthfulness and clarity of the information regarding my account. 

I request that, in compliance with FCRA and TILA, you investigate this dispute and immediately remove the inaccurate information, including the "" charge-off, '' from my credit report. The differences between the credit bureaus clearly show the inaccuracy of the reported information. Please send me the results of your investigation and a corrected report as soon as possible. 

I have attached copies of my credit reports highlighting the mentioned discrepancies for your reference.

The FCRA also grants me the right to request the removal of information resulting from identity theft. Given the widespread issues linked to the national data breach, it is clear that this debt has been fraudulently placed on my credit report due to unauthorized use of my personal information. Therefore, I am requesting the immediate removal of this debt from my credit report.

Requested Actions : Immediate Investigation : Please investigate the fraudulent debt and verify its accuracy.

Deletion of Fraudulent Account : As this debt does not belong to me and was fraudulently placed, I demand its immediate removal from my TransUnion credit report.

This delay in addressing my dispute and the inaccuracies reflected in my credit report have caused me significant harm, including [ specify any adverse consequences such as being denied credit, incurring higher interest rates, or being unable to secure housing or employment ]. 

In light of this violation, I am demanding monetary relief for the damages incurred as a result of XXXXXXXX XXXX failure to comply with the FCRA.

Therefore, I demand compensation in the amount of [ specify the amount you believe is fair and reasonable ] for the damages caused by XXXX XXXX inaction. 

I expect a prompt response to this demand letter within 30 days from the date of receipt. Failure to provide a satisfactory response or offer appropriate monetary relief may result in further legal action to protect my rights under the FCRA. 

Please be advised that if I do not receive a satisfactory response to all five of my demands by [ insert deadline, typically 30 days ], I will have no choice but to pursue legal action against XXXX. I will also be seeking {$1000.00} per violation for the following claims : 1. **Defamation of Character** : Your failure to report accurate information has significantly impacted my reputation and credibility.

I have never filed for bankruptcy in my entire life, and this entry is clearly a result of either mistaken identity or fraudulent activity, potentially stemming from the recent national data breach that compromised the personal information of millions of individuals. 

Details of the Disputed Bankruptcy : Filing Court : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Filing Date : XX/XX/XXXX Case Number : XXXX This inaccurate information is causing significant damage to my credit profile, and under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute and have any inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information removed from my credit file. Specifically, FCRA Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires credit reporting agencies to promptly investigate disputes and correct or delete inaccurate information.

Additionally, under FCRA Section 605 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ), the inclusion of this erroneous bankruptcy is an unjust representation of my creditworthiness, as bankruptcies are major derogatory marks that should only be reported when valid. I believe this error is likely connected to the national data breach, which has compromised sensitive personal data and may have led to unauthorized use of my identity. 

Requested Actions : Immediate Investigation : I request an immediate investigation into the inaccurate bankruptcy reporting. 

Removal of the Bankruptcy Entry : As this entry is entirely false, I demand its complete removal from my credit report. 

I appreciate your immediate attention to this urgent matter and look forward to a timely resolution.

'' After reviewing my credit report, I have identified the following discrepancies between the credit bureaus ( TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX ) : TransUnion : Highest reported balance : {$2700.00} Current balance owed : {$2600.00} Payment status : Closed, reported as "" Charged off. '' XXXX : XXXX reported balance : $ XXXXCurrent balance owed : {$2600.00} Payment status : Closed, reported as "" Charged off. '' XXXX : XXXX reported balance : {$2600.00} XXXX balance owed : {$2600.00} Payment status : Closed, reported as "" Charged off, '' additionally noting that the balance was "" reported as a loss by the creditor. '' Furthermore, according to the XXXX report, the account was closed due to inactivity, which is a significant discrepancy compared to the other bureaus that do not mention inactivity as the reason for closure. This inconsistency between the credit bureaus impacts my right to have my information reported accurately and fairly as stipulated by the FCRA under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which mandates that credit bureaus maintain maximum accuracy in the information reported.

Under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1601 ), I am entitled to clear and accurate information regarding credit obligations and payment history, which is not being reflected in this case due to inconsistencies between the different credit bureaus.

I request that, in accordance with the FCRA and TILA, you investigate this dispute and promptly remove the inaccurate information and the charge-off from my credit report, as the discrepancies and errors demonstrate the inaccuracy of the information being reported. Please provide me with the results of your investigation and a corrected credit report as soon as possible.

I have attached copies of my credit report highlighting the discrepancies and the inaccurate information.

Eradicate any and all of these following unproven genuine, FCRA compliant, and or applicable standards of reporting of which you are undoubtedly mandated in your reporting obligation ( s ) to obey without default or deficiency of any sort.

The FCRA 's permissible purpose provisions are thus central to the statute 's protection of consumer privacy.

In accord with 5 U.S. Code 552a - Records maintained on individuals ( b ) Conditions of Disclosure.No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record would be.

15 U.S. Code 1681- Congressional findings and statement of purpose ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.

( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy.

15 U.S. Code 1681a - Definitions ; rules of construction ( d ) Consumer Report.

( 1 ) In general.The term consumer report means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumers credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumers eligibility for ( A ) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes ; 12 CFR Part 1022 - Fair Credit Reporting ( Regulation V ) FCRA section 607 ( a ) requires that consumer reporting companies, among other things, must require that prospective users of consumer reports certify the purposes for which the information is sought, and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose. 

Consumers suffer harm when consumer reporting agencies provide consumer reports to persons who are not authorized to receive the information or when recipients of consumer reports obtain or use such reports for purposes other than permissible purposes. These harms include the invasion of my ' privacy, as well as reputational, emotional, physical, and economic harms.

12 CFR Part 1022 - Fair Credit Reporting ( Regulation V ) permissible purpose provisions to the protection of consumer privacy, the Bureau is issuing this advisory opinion to affirm that consumer reporting agencies may not provide a consumer report pursuant to FCRA section 604 ( a ) under any circumstance not expressly permitted by this section.

A consumer reporting company may not provide a consumer report under FCRA section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) unless it has reason to believe that the user has a permissible purpose with respect to the consumer about whom the report is requested. A user 's request to a consumer reporting company for a report about a consumer does not give the consumer reporting company a reason to believe that the user has a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer report about other consumers. As explained in part XXXX, XXXX enacted the FCRA in part to address a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with... a respect for the consumer 's right to privacy. 

FCRA section 619 imposes criminal liability on any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses. 

The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, protects individuals ' personal information from unwarranted invasions of privacy.

Subject : Complaint Against XXXX and Transunion for Refusal to Update Personal Information Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint against XXXX and Transunion for their refusal to update my personal information on my credit report. On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a personal information update letter to XXXX, requesting the correction of my address and other personal details. This letter was accompanied by the necessary documentation, including a copy of my driver 's license, Social Security card, and a utility bill to verify my address. The document was also notarized. 
However, on XX/XX/year>, I received a response from XXXX stating that my request could not be processed because I did not provide a government ID. This statement is incorrect and misleading, as I had included all required documents, including a government-issued ID, in my initial submission. 
Attached to this complaint, you will find a copy of my original personal information update letter and all supporting documents that were submitted to XXXX. 
I believe that XXXX 's refusal to update my information is a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically under sections 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( Compliance procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy ). 
XXXX 's failure to acknowledge and properly review the provided documentation is a direct violation of my rights under the FCRA. According to the FCRA, consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate information on their credit reports and must be provided with a fair and reasonable investigation of their dispute. By ignoring the documentation I provided, TransUnion has failed to uphold their obligation to conduct a fair investigation, thereby violating my consumer rights. 
I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and ensure that Experian updates my personal information as requested. Additionally, I seek confirmation that my credit report will reflect the accurate and updated information without further delays. 
Furthermore, I demand a deletion of all personally identifiable information from my consumer credit report with the exception of :",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,30331,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10058812

Below are the details of the account in question : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date of Charge-Off : XX/XX/year> It has come to my attention that this charge-off is being reported repeatedly monthly, which is incorrect. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as a charge-off should be reported only once, reflecting the date it was charged off. 
Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off misrepresents my payment history and negatively impacts my credit score.

Furthermore, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the initial delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ).

Repeatedly reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reflect the statute of limitations and is therefore improper.

2024-09-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information reported on my credit report concerning a charge-off. Below are the details of the account in question : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Account NumberXXXX Date of Charge-Off : XX/XX/ It has come to my attention that this charge-off is being reported repeatedly monthly, which is incorrect. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as a charge-off should be reported only once, reflecting the date it was charged off. 
Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off misrepresents my payment history and negatively impacts my credit score. Furthermore, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the initial delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ). Repeatedly reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reflect the statute of limitations and is therefore improper. 
I request an immediate investigation into this matter and the correction of my credit report by removing the repeated entries of the charge-off from my payment history. Please update my credit report accordingly and provide written confirmation of these corrections.

I recently reviewed my credit report and found unauthorized inquiries.

I contacted the below creditors, and they have NO proof I initiated such inquiries, nor written authorization and have failed to provide any permissible purpose. Since, they do not have my authorization, written nor verbal, I ask that you DELETE these authorized inquiries from my credit report immediately as there is no evidence of any authorization, nor any permissible purpose.

Inquiries are not a matter of record when I never gave these companies access to My credit file!!

This inconsistency can make it difficult for businesses operating across state lines to accurately assess creditworthiness.

2. **Data Accuracy Issues : ** Errors in credit reports can negatively impact individuals and businesses, leading to difficulties in obtaining loans, financing, or even employment. These errors can be time-consuming to correct, especially when dealing with multiple credit reporting agencies.

3. **Limited Access to Credit : ** Individuals and businesses in certain regions, particularly rural areas, may have limited access to credit due to factors like lack of local lenders or reliance on credit reporting agencies that are less familiar with their specific circumstances. 
XXXX. **Excessive Fees : ** Some credit reporting agencies charge fees for accessing credit reports or correcting errors, which can be a financial burden for individuals and businesses, especially those operating on a tight budget. 

These factors can hinder the smooth flow of goods, services, and capital across state lines, ultimately impacting the overall health of the economy. To address these issues, various regulations and initiatives have been implemented, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which provides consumers with certain rights regarding their credit reports.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",AK,996XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10058013

Taking that event into consideration, I went about checking on my credit to see if there was any errors that was unbeknowst to me during that time. Upon doing so, I had noticed there were several inquiries that I had no knowledge of nor had given each of those financial institutions any permission to pull my credit at any point in my life so far. With this information in hand, I sent out a letter by certified mail to Transunion on XX/XX/year> in which I stated that there were erroneous inquiries on my credit report that did not have permissable permission from me to exist on my credit report. Additionally, I requested that those listed inquiries be investigated and removed due to them being unauthorized by me. ( please see attached letter that was sent ). I patiently waited 30 days per FCRA rules for a response and never received one. In the month of XXXX, I checked my credit report then to see if during the updating of my credit report phase had occured, had there been any changes/removals of the unauthorized inquiries to which I discovered there nothing had been removed but instead, I discovered a new hard inquiry that was listed/titled as "" XXXX ''. I give the Transunion even more time during the whole month of XXXX and nothing changed about what was negatively being reported against me. On XX/XX/year>, close to 75 days later, I sent Transunion a letter by certified mail of their failure to execute their responsibilities of adherence to consumer law and FCRA policy to which their governed and demanded the inquiries be removed.

I then come to realize another two charges, both from the same location. These charges were from XXXX ( A location far from where I live ). I initially called on XX/XX/XXXX to dispute all the charges because they were not made by me as well as replace my credit card. I explicitly stated that I want to reverse these but they end up only replacing my credit card and leaving these charges undisputed. I had to wait around a week before calling again. This time they tell me that the charges were never disputed but that theyll go ahead and add that to the claim. I wait another week, with no updates and after more than the 5-10 days they told me I would receive an update, a letter finally arrives multiple weeks after disputing the charges. The letter then states that the XXXX transactions were adjusted and that I will receive credit for the issue. However, they never even disputed the charge of {$210.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had been patient and kind with all of the representatives during these calls so I was left wondering why I was not receiving quality care. Thus, for a fourth time I had to call to finally have it disputed. In the end, they rejected my dispute with the reasoning that I had it in my possession at the time of transaction. I am extremely dissatisfied and frankly, upset with the runarounds. I have never been to that location neither or would ever because one, i am not interested in their services, especially as a more masculine male. Two, Im not their target customer base.

I do not answer because did not know she was calling because they said I could not talk to anyone, I am also sending messages on their website and they said that reason why they decreased it is because I was not using my credit so they lowered to go with what I was using.

This complaint is in addition to my previous grievances about BOA 's ongoing financial misconduct and obstruction. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX New Incident : 1. Payment Attempt : On XX/XX/XXXX, one day before the due date, I made a payment on my BOA credit card account via phone, as online access remains restricted. 
2. Delayed Processing : Despite making the payment before the due date, BOA did not process the payment until XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me the payment was processed, which turned out not to be true, resulting in negative affect on my XXXXredit score.

3. Late Payment Status : As a result of this delay, my account was marked as having a late payment, further damaging my credit score. XXXX XXXX XXXX Specific Concerns : 1. Intentional Delay : Given the pattern of obstruction I've experienced, I believe this delay in processing may have been intentional, designed to force my account into late status. 
2. Lack of Transparency : At no point during the payment process was I informed that the payment would not be processed immediately or that it might result in a late payment status.

3. Continued Credit Damage : This late payment mark adds to the ongoing damage to my credit score, which I detailed in my previous complaint.

4. Compounding Issues : This incident compounds the problems I've been facing with BOA, including restricted account access and potential retaliatory actions. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  Additional Context : - This incident occurred despite my diligent efforts to make the payment on time, navigating the obstacles BOA has placed in my way. 
- The continued pattern of issues suggests a systematic effort to hinder my ability to manage my account and maintain my credit standing. 

This incident further demonstrates the urgent need for intervention. The combined effect of BOA 's actions continues to jeopardize my financial stability and future prospects, including my ability to secure housing. 

I am prepared to provide any additional information or documentation necessary to support this complaint. I urgently seek your immediate intervention to address these compounding issues with Bank of America. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

2024-09-08,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Re : Bank of America - Ongoing Financial Misconduct and Credit Damage Date : [ Current Date ] Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Bank of America ( BOA ) for their continued pattern of financial misconduct, which is severely impacting my credit score and jeopardizing my ability to secure housing. This complaint is a follow-up to previous grievances I have filed, as the situation has not improved and has, in fact, worsened. 
Background : Following my initial complaints about fraudulent transfers, BOA closed all my accounts, including a credit card. 
Despite the account closures, the credit card continues to accrue interest, negatively impacting my credit score. 
I have been systematically denied access to online banking services, preventing me from managing my accounts and making payments. 

Recent Developments : BOA has effectively weaponized their private wealth management team to restrict my ability to pay off my credit card debt. 
My only option for payment is through phone calls, which has proven unreliable and potentially manipulated. 
A recent attempt to make a payment before the 120-day past due mark was unsuccessful, resulting in additional penalties.

When calling to address this issue, I was informed that collections are responsible for processing these payments but are unavailable on Sundays, further delaying resolution.

Specific Concerns : Deliberate Obstruction : The continued technical issues preventing online access appear to be intentional, designed to hinder my ability to manage and pay off my debt.

Retaliatory Practices : The pattern of account closures and subsequent obstacles strongly suggest retaliatory action for my previous complaints.

Credit Score Damage : The ongoing interest accrual and reported late payments are causing significant and potentially long-lasting damage to my credit score.

Housing Jeopardy : As a direct result of these actions, my ability to secure an apartment is now at risk due to my compromised credit standing.

2024-09-08,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Installment loan,Problem with additional add-on products or services,,"I entered into a signed agreement with XXXX XXXX, a representative of XXXX, XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The system, she said would be delivered and installed by XXXX : however, delivery and install of the XXXX system did not happen until late May. The sales pitch was that I would have virtually no electrical bill due to solar systems production and that I would receive a tax rebate of {$7700.00} to facilitate the early pay-off of the system if applied to the XXXX XXXX installment plan. The system was financed through Sunlight Financial at a rate of .99 % if payments were XXXX which resulted in a monthly of approximately {$100.00} and some change. This payment would change and increased to {$140.00} and some change if the rebate in the amount of {$7700.00} was not applied or paid toward the principal by the due date on or before the XXXX month. Well, the stated rebate-promised/stated rebate never happened. See the video link below. 
https : XXXX? XXXX Now back to the install of solar system. Upon the completion of the system, I began to receive utility bills XXXX times more than I was paying without the system. I called the company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to tell of this acute increase in my billing statement. It wasnt XXXX XXXX that I spoke with, but a XXXX was now the spokesperson for the entity. She vowed to assist me the problem and find some kind of resolution. I repeatedly told her that it appeared as if the solar system itself was the cause of the sharp increase. My usage went from XXXX kilowatts to XXXX hr. per month immediately after the system was put in operation. She and others blamed the utility company and agreed to speak with them to make sure that the meter readings were correct and to make sure that the surplus or over-production of solar power was being credited towards the bill. We called them all-we called the servicers and the delivers of the electricity to determine if all the settings and meters were properly in place. All of them assured us that everything concerning the meter setup was in place and correct. Months of this would go on-back and forth with providers and the delivery company. By this time, I am on my third provider due to not being able to satisfy payment of the humongous bills -- XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. XXXX promises to have technician out to home to affirm a correct and proper install of the system and a promise to pay the high bills from the utility companies by the owner XXXX & an associate named XXXX XXXX XXXX father was part owner of the entity with XXXX. In the meantime, Im trying to mitigate as much as I possibly can. I scaled back my usage of all power that my family could stand. I am XXXX to 7 months into the system when finally someone come to check the system. I can not recall the name of the person but all he said was that the meter is running backwards and that faut lies with the delivery of the XXXX. So, I move to deal with XXXX who says in return that the issue is the system itself the installation thereof. 
I call XXXX & send out blast texts to all XXXX associates and representative on a regular to see if anyone could or would rescue me from what Ive encountered. I had to do this every chance XXXX got-sometimes very early and sometime very late because the answering of my call had become null and void. Finally I get a call from a XXXX or a XXXX who says my dealing is not with him but call XXXX. I ask who XXXX and he is tells me XXXX XXXX is the owner of the company. I called him and he said that someone would be out to check out the system. Again months go by and still no one shows up. I again start to call and or send out blast text to get some attention. I get a call from XXXX XXXX who tells me I can not be bugging his team so early. He said for me to deal with him only and not be sending out text messages to them guys again -- he begins to isolate me. My dealing with him proved futile as well. I was told by his reps/associates that my high billings would be taken care of until they could get to the bottom of the issue. He told me to send him my billing statements that amounted about {$1500.00} for and he sent a check for like {$600.00}. Again, months would pass with no response from the company. I continued to mitigate the expense of powering my home. I also became suspicious of the XXXX XXXX XXXX entity and started to investigate and inquire answers online. I made claims and reports to BBB. I had roofers to install extra wind turbines which amounted to {$1200.00} in the roof which I never needed before. XXXX installed, light bulbs changed, new heat pump XXXX unit all of which I never needed prior to the installed solar system. I even called the manufacturer of the installed inverter to see what could be done to alleviate the high energy cost of powering my home and to tell of an out of business rumor of the entity. On XXXX different occasions I spoke with a XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX who suggested I move on and locate another entity to service the system because the system appeared to be grossly under producing from the interview on the phone. In following their suggestion no one but no one would consent to touch the work of another company or XXXX due to possibly liabilities. Also to get someone to work on or check out the system could possibly cancel out the warranty that supposingly came with the equipment. They gave a lot of reasons for not assisting in the efforts and said that it would be at least $ XXXX for the efforts not including travel to my site. XXXX reason they gave really caught my attention and that was the fact that many of these XXXX did not obtain proper permits to install the systems and suggested that I write or contact the agency for licensed electricians. To add salt to the injury, I went to the XXXX of XXXX to see if I could obtain information on the licensed electrician who performed the install only to found out that no such permit to perform any electrical work on my home was obtained. There I spoke with a XXXX XXXX who told me that no permit existed for such a job! Now I am faced with legality issues and transgressions of city ordinances. I thought to seek legal avenues, but no lawyer would even consider the issue for me. They all suggested that I stop all payment, but this would further jeopardize a perfect credit reporting that is already tarnish by the utility companies reporting not pay outstanding monthly bills. 
XXXX stated above, I am left to take actions of reporting, researching, and investigating in my own hands since no resolution was arrived at. This is what I have so far : XXXX mounting complaints against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX BBB ( all are similar to XXXX XXXX, communication, & etc ; XXXX out of business and/but operating in the same industry under a new name and identity -- Sunset XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the courts of XXXX XXXX, OK against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX https XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX... ) I spoke with the XXXX XXXX attorney, XXXX XXXX, to ask if I could join XXXX XXXX a witness in the case. He thanked me for the call and offer but stated that he was not sure if there would be anything profited but that he would keep my contact information should anything positive come out of the suit. I am the one who told him and the BBB that the entity was using another name to maintain his devious practices in the industry. XXXX. Sunlight Financial LLC has its share of complaints and perils-internal & through the BBB. By way of email correspondence, I received approximately 6 months worth of installments notifications. I knew this because I had to register my account online to make the payments. When I noticed that no billing correspondences were no longer coming through the email system, I went to the customer portal to check what was happening. Some how or another I was direct or directed to call a Launch Servicing ... I also discovered an email from them dated XX/XX/XXXX stating... Dear XXXX XXXX, There is an important document available for you from Launch Servicing, LLC for account number ending in XXXX. Please log in to your online account and select XXXX Account, then Account Documents and Correspondence to view this important account communication. 

Please do not respond to this message. To respond, send a message from your online account or call us at ( XXXX ) XXXX. 

You are receiving this email because you signed up for electronic communication through XXXX XXXX, XXXX. If you would like to stop receiving email notifications and resume receiving paper copies of your account documents, you XXXX change your delivery preferences once you are in your online account. 

Thank you, The Launch Servicing, XXXX Customer Service XXXX '' At this point, I am asking questions because I had never heard or had an account with any Launch Servicing, so I called the number. Sunlight XXXX never disclosed any such information or a transfer of the account to me about any intent to have a XXXX XXXX handle the installment payments. Neither did I consent to such a move or transaction. I had no choice in the matter but had to continue to pay to keep my credit report in good standings. Now, as a result of the unbeknown transfer, on my credit report it shows I have XXXX separate accounts for the original installment XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX transaction. The impact is and has an erroneous affect on my credit worthiness as it relates to income to debt ratio! Also, Launch Servicing reps are not any assistance to my cause at all. I reported to them case and argument, first on XX/XX/XXXX with no results until XX/XX/XXXX stating Message about servicing XXXX, The email that was sent on XXXX "" Hello XXXX XXXX, Please see attached XXXX letter XXXX issued in XXXX. We understand you XXXX be experiencing some issues with the performance of your system. However, Sunlight XXXX is not responsible for maintenance of the solar system. If damages have occurred or an item needs to be addressed, we recommend reaching out to your systems manufacturer, or a solar provider in your area to get the item serviced. '' XXXX Customer Service '' Prior to that response, the reps said that should request a postponement of payment form until a solution could be found and arrived at and if the issue isn't solved continue to request the postponement. I did that and it was granted. But here is the kicker, I called be to see what was the hold up on arriving a solution to my case and the rep said that it had been closed so she had to open another case for the same complaint. Also my advised "" file again for a postponement was denied because they said to that I needed to make the request closer to the due date? Wow! I not sure how much closer I should have requested before payment and draft taken place. I am cursed if I do and damned if I don't, huh? This is my plight with this company XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, & Launch Servicing!

Back on XX/XX/XXXX, ( I was moving from XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I paid off all my bills, cut up all my cards and closed all my C/C. The only C/C that did NOT close my account was : Wyndham Reward Earner Card. My other C/C have me listed as : Paid, Closed / Never Late Account closed at credit grantors request. 

According to my credit report, Wyndham Reward Earner Card, accepted my payment of Paid In FULL on XX/XX/XXXX, and no charges were recorded from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and then my Closed Account was being charged ( with small charges ( Under {$50.00} ) ) until XX/XX/XXXX and after that, NO MORE CHARGES. Now Barclays Bank, says they charged off $ XXXX and listed me as {$410.00} past due. 

*There is no proof or documentation of this {$100.00} charge off. 

During this time frame of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I was not informed that my account was still active and that someone else was using this credit Card, that I had cancelled. 

It wasnt until I received a letter from : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  On XX/XX/XXXX, informing me that Wyndham Reward Earner Card XXXX Barclays Bank Delaware had hired them to collect a debt of {$410.00}, and this is when the Harassment started. XXXX XXXX XXXX would call me on my cell phone and call my wife on her cell phone. It was not until I contacted them to STOP, then they did. I was told that they were hired by, Wyndham Reward / Barclays Bank Delaware, for charges made with my C/C after I had paid the C/C off. I ask them ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for documentation or Validation of Said Debt. As of today ( XXXX XXXX ) no documentation has been provided, nor have I had any contact with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

While my wife and I were enjoying the XX/XX/XXXX weekend ( XXXX ), my wife received a harassing phone call from the following company**, informing her that I owned Barclays Bank of Delaware , {$410.00} and they were calling to collect. I informed the lady on the phone, that this was my wifes cell number and not to call me or her on this number. The lady informed me that they have the right call me on my cell number and my wifes cell number. I told them to stop, and the lady replied that they would, only after they XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) receive the request in writing. The lady insisted that I make a payment over the phone, to stop these calls and I said no, and hung up. 

A letter was sent, with the date of XXXX XXXX, from : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MN XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX them to STOP harassing me by phone and to STOP calling my wifes phone. They informed me of the same information that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, had told me, again, I asked for Validation of Said Debt. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a statement dated XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and this statement only showed : v XXXX XXXX v Interest Charged o What the statement DID NOT SHOW, was the purchases ( that Wyndham Reward Card / Barclays Bank Delaware ) claimed that I made after I had paid the debt off and when and/or were, the charges were made. 

Once I read the statement, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and told them, that this statement is NOT a letter of Validation of Said Debt and to this date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I have not heard back from this company or received any other documentation or letter of validation. 

And the harassment continues, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from another debt collector : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX DE XXXX I have informed this Debt Collector of the same information that I had informed the other XXXX Debt XXXX of. 

Here are some of the points that are strange to me : XXXX. That Wyndham Reward Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware never contact me? 

XXXX. Why did Wyndham Reward Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware, wait a year and a half ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) and then send debt collector ( XXXX ) after me? 

XXXX. Why is there is no proof or documentation of this {$100.00} charge off? 

XXXX. Why wouldnt Wyndham Rewards / Barclays Bank Delaware provide me with any type of documentation or Validation of Said Debt? 

XXXX. Once the Debt XXXX contact me and I request they STOP calling and ask for them to provide me, documentation or Validation of Said Debt, the debt collector stops and Wyndham Rewards / Barclays bank Delaware, hires a different debt collector to harass me? 

XXXX. Why did Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware have me down for {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and that never changed? Is because that was the date I paid my C/C Paid in Full and cancelled it! 

XXXX. I was told that there was activity on my Closed Account, right after I Paid the debt off in full ( XX/XX/XXXX ), however, according to my credit report, there was NO active, from XX/XX/XXXX, until XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX. Was Wyndham Rewards Earner Card hacked? 

XXXX. Was Barclays Bank Delaware hacked? 

XXXX. Why didnt Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware XXXX do as all my other C/C did and mark me as follows? 

a. XXXX, XXXX / Never XXXX b. Account closed at credit grantors request. 

XXXX. Why did Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware, keep my account open? 

XXXX. Why did Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware, allow fraudulent charges to be charged to my INACTIVE and CLOSED account, for XXXX  months? 

XXXX. Why did Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware, allow fraudulent charges to keep being charged for XXXX months and then STOP? 

XXXX. Why did Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware, have me down for Scheduled Payments from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, then STOP? and then have it revert back to XXXX? 

XXXX. During these XXXX  months, Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware, made no effort to contact me! WHY? 

XXXX. The Charges that Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank Delaware, allowed for those XXXX months in XXXX, are as follows : XXXX XXXX {$100.00} o XXXX {$32.00} o XXXX {$43.00} o XXXX {$45.00} o XXXX {$45.00} o XXXX {$48.00} o XXXX {$48.00} o XXXX {$49.00} XXXX. You would think someone at Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank XXXX would catch fraud charges that keep coming every month for under {$50.00}. 

What I would like to see happened : XXXX. Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank quit harnessing me and my wife. 

XXXX. Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank would drop the {$410.00}. 

XXXX. Wyndham Rewards Earner Card / Barclays Bank would reverse their remarks on my credit report, from Red to Green.

Description of the Issue : On XX/XX/year>, Ally Financial submitted a letter to me, XXXX XXXX, stating that my auto loan was paid off. During this period, the Texas Title for the vehicle was released by Ally Financial and sent to me via mail, further confirming that the loan was settled. 

However, on XX/XX/year>, I discovered that Ally Financial had reported my account as past due and delinquent on my credit report. I immediately contacted Ally Financial to resolve this discrepancy. During our discussions, Ally Financial admitted that they had mistakenly sent the letter on XX/XX/year>, incorrectly stating that the loan was paid off, and also released the vehicle title to me in error. Despite this admission, Ally Financial failed to inform me of any remaining balance prior to damaging my credit report. 

XXXX. Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue : I attempted to negotiate with Ally Financial and sought a resolution, making it clear that : Ally Financial had reported the account as paid off in their letter. 
Ally Financial released the title to the auto, reinforcing the statement that the loan was settled. 
Ally Financial never contacted me by any means to address their mistake or to notify me of any outstanding balance before tarnishing my credit report. 
I was more than willing to pay any remaining balance if one existed, as I was under the impression, based on Ally Financial 's communication, that the loan was fully paid off. On XX/XX/year>, I paid the remaining balance immediately upon being informed. Despite this, Ally Financial has refused to remove the negative reports from my credit report that were due to their admitted errors. 

XXXX. How This Issue Has Affected Me : The inaccurate reporting by Ally Financial has negatively impacted my credit score, causing undue stress and financial hardship. This mistake has affected my ability to obtain credit on reasonable terms, which is unfair given that the negative report resulted solely from Ally Financial 's admitted errors. 

XXXX. What I Am Requesting : I request that Ally Financial correct their records and immediately update all relevant credit reporting agencies to remove the negative entries associated with this account, given that these entries were made due to their mistake. I also ask for written confirmation that these corrections have been made. 

Supporting Documents : A copy of the letter from Ally Financial dated XX/XX/year>, confirming the loan was paid off. 
Records of communication with Ally Financial regarding the discrepancies and my prompt payment of the balance. 

XXXX. Desired Resolution : I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter and ensure that Ally Financial corrects their error by updating my credit report to accurately reflect the resolution of this account as of XX/XX/year>, and remove all negative entries that were incorrectly reported. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance in resolving this issue.

2024-09-08,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"Dear CFBP team, I have been struggling for over 3 months to resolve a missing deposit to my Capital One checking account. 

My employer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, has been depositing my check by mail to Capital One every month for a year. 

The check comes from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It comes in the amount of {$2500.00}. 

The check is sent to : Capital One Attn : Payment Processing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX My XX/XX/XXXX paycheck was mailed to Capital One at the end of XXXX. It was supposed to show in my checking account before the XXXX  of XXXX, but it never did. 

I asked my employer to look into it. He checked with his banker, XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX, and the funds were removed from my employers account. It shows Capital One processed the deposit on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We waited a few days to see if it would appear. Then I called Capital One to ask what the delay was. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Call # XXXX [ XXXX ] : I explained to the Capital One phone rep that my employer has been sending checks to deposit in my account for almost a year, and mine had not shown up in the account yet. 

The rep told me initially that the branch my employer had been sending the checks to closed down. He said in that case, the check would be returned by mail. 

I explained to him that clearly the check was not returned by mail because the funds were already removed from my employers account and are not showing in mine. 

He then told me to verify the address that my employer had been sending the check to ( after having already told me the branch had closed ) and call back to file a missing deposit claim. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ] : I spoke to another rep and told him I had the address. It is the same address printed on the checks. He said I needed a 15-digit trace number to file a claim.

I contacted my employer, and he contacted XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX again for the tracing number. 

XXXX XXXX verified that the check had been paid and that it had been processed by Capital One. They send me a copy of the check and the trace number ( attached ). 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ] : I called Capital One back and spoke to another rep who said she would file a claim. I told her I had copies of the check. Couldnt I just email them? It seemed that was not an option. 

I told her my employers name and trace number as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX She told me that she filed a claim, and I would hear back within 45 days. 
This was very concerning as waiting a month and a half for my pay would be difficult, but I had no choice. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Capital One saying my claim # XXXX was denied ( attached ). 

The email says : We finished researching your disputes. Based on the information we have, your claim has been denied due to the following : Our records dont show an incoming deposit from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$2500.00}. We recommend you reach out to the sender to verify they have the correct account and routing info. Once confirmed, please request a 15-digit trace number from the senders bank. This proves the payment has successfully been sent and allows us to better research the deposit in question. 

They did not give any real reason for denying the claim or how the money disappeared. Also, the name of the company is wrong. The rep did not record it correctly. It also asks for the trace number, which I had already given. 
During this time, I was in XXXX dealing with a family crisis and was unable to respond right away. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ] : I called the phone number given in the email, explaining to a rep named XXXX that my claim had been denied, but the information in the claim was wrong and that may be the reason the problem isnt resolved. I also reiterated that I had copies of the check and my employers bank statements to prove Capital One deposited/cashed the check that did not appear in my account. 

She told me that she corrected my information and instructed me to send my documents to XXXX referencing my claim number. I would hear something in 15 business days. 

XXXX XXXX I emailed XXXX as instructed, attaching the front and back of the check and all the information thus far. 

I never got a confirmation the email was received or any reply whatsoever. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Call # XXXX [ XXXX ] : I called Capital One again, asking for an update on the status of my claim. The rep verified my info and said she would resubmit it. I would hear from someone in 15 business days. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX MAIL Since I was traveling in XXXX and had not heard anything back from my inquiries, my employer, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and Owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, offered to send hard copies of the documents to Capital One by mail. We followed the instructions here XXXX XXXX XXXX. He also included a letter from himself on the company letterhead. We have yet to receive any reply. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ] : I had not had any replies from Capital One to my emails or any phone calls or the mailed in dispute, so I called again to ask about the status of my claim. 

The rep said that there was nothing that could be done. 
She said I must call the branch that the check was sent to. 
I asked her to give me the contact information for that location. 
She said she could not. I would have to look it up myself. 

After getting off the phone with her, I looked up the phone number for the Capital One address the payment was being sent to ( the same one printed on the check ). It is the payment processing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  which I could not find any phone number for except the usual customer service XXXX number that I had been calling with no success. 

Ive attached screenshots of my Capital One checking account showing all the mailed in deposits since XX/XX/XXXX. Ive also included the check and copies of my emails. 
It has been over 3 months that I have been missing my XXXX paycheck. I have called 6 times and sent 4 emails. I tried to get help on XXXX and XXXX. 

My employer sent all the documents and the dispute from via XXXX mail. I have not received any response from these communications. 

The representatives Ive spoken with over the phone are friendly, but do not seem confident in what needs to be done in this situation and have not been helpful in resolving my problem or giving me adequate reasons for my claim being denied. Many were not XXXX XXXXXXXX speakers, and I think that is why there was so much error over the phone. 

I have been a Capital One customer since XXXX. I have several savings accounts in addition to my checking, and also a credit card. I am never late with payments and I never overdraft. All identity verification steps have been completed throughout the claims process, despite my temporary location in Panama.I don't understand how the bank can treat a customer this way. 

Clearly, someone at Capital One made a mistake or committed fraud, and I am still missing a months worth of pay in the amount of {$2500.00}. 

In conclusion, this case involves a consistent history of successful deposits suddenly interrupted, with clear evidence from XXXX XXXX confirming the funds ' withdrawal. 

Despite providing a trace number, Capital One has failed to effectively utilize this information. Their communication has been inconsistent and often unresponsive, with representatives providing conflicting information. The financial impact of missing a month 's pay has been significant, and has disrupted my financial plans as well as my daily living. 

I'm requesting a thorough investigation using the provided trace number, a detailed explanation of the funds ' whereabouts, and compensation for the time and resources expended. 

This situation potentially violates banking regulations regarding timely dispute resolution and proper deposit handling. I've provided a clear timeline of events and am requesting escalation to a higher authority within Capital One, given the complexity and duration of this issue. As a loyal customer since XXXX with multiple accounts, I expect Capital One to treat this matter with the seriousness it deserves and to provide a prompt and satisfactory resolution. 

I have further documentation if needed. 

Note : Since this issue, I've asked my employer to wire me my pay. In XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX accidentally sent me both a check and a wire. The mailed in check did clear, so it proves that the branch they were sending it to was not closed and it was processed as usual. When XXXX XXXX XXXX discovered they paid me twice, the check was cancelled and the funds returned.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,34769,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,10052321

2024-09-08,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,"I became the guardian for my Dad after a lengthy legal battle until he passed in 2021. US Bank allowed someone to take money out of his account, who I believed actually worked for them in XXXX, XXXX  ( per her stating she worked there ), they ignored my submission of facts, and ignored my attempts to address this. My Dad had several mental and physical disorders. It was a clear issue of elder abuse. They said I missed the submission date, but they did not send the information to my address as requested, instead to the address that the person was at, making it difficult for me to address. They would not help me then and I still could not get help from the local branch in XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX as it was too costly to go to XXXX. 

In conjunction with all this, when I received guardianship of my Dad after going through a lengthy legal process, I set up this account with USBank. My Dad 's previous accounts where money was being taken from him was there, so I figured it was just easy to transfer until I could figure something out He passed away in the XXXX due to XXXX  XXXX  due to this situation, and now I have been battling with US Bank over the accounts. I am the sole heir as deemed by the XXXX  court system as my Dad didn't have much. They have routinely taken {$5.00} out of the account and now it is not even {$100.00}. I physically took in proof of death certificate ( made me bring in an original certificate twice ) and the court order to the local bank in XXXX XXXX, which they took copies of twice, and they refuse to let me close the account, even though there was a court order I provided. 

So the first issue is that they will not let me close these accounts and let the now less than {$100.00} come to me. They keep taking it. They state it is a federal legal thing and they can't close it for me. 

Second issue, they sold my mortgage which was transferred to US Bank when US Bank purchase XXXX XXXX. A few days ago, I received a notice that they just closed my personal checking account, which had nothing to do with my Dad 's account, and took the few dollars that were in it. Nothing now shows up on my online account and I can not access any statements. I received no prior notice they were doing this and no mailed correspondence, just an email after the fact with the last 4 digits of my account. 

I realize this is not XXXX XXXX XXXX, but it is the principal of this entire issue of how it was handled. I was just trying to clean up and close this matter for my Dad. The stress I endured for two years trying to save my Dad from this person, to have him die in the XXXX where she dumped him during XXXX  has been unbelievable and US Bank just wouldn't help me when I provided them the documents twice. 


And now, they took my checking account, closed it, which I was required to have by the original XXXX XXXX  to do my mortgage with them. 

I feel that they should have immediately helped me not only with the woman taking his money, but allowed me to take out the remaining money, which was about {$200.00}? that was my "" inheritance ''. They have removed all the statements, so I can't define exactly what is missing and I gave up. The last time I went in, the account people were sitting there, but refused to help me without a prior appointment, even after they asked what they could help me with?

- **Company Sold** : The field seems incomplete. It could be missing details such as the name of the company that purchased the debt, if it was sold to another entity.

- **Balance** : While the balance shows "" {$670.00}, '' it's unclear whether this was the original balance, the balance after settlement, or the remaining balance at the time of reporting. 
- **Terms** : The terms are left empty. This usually includes information like the payment terms, such as "" 12 months '' or "" revolving. '' 2. **Inaccurate or Unclear Information : ** - **Paid Off** : The statement "" Account paid in full for less than full balance '' suggests that the debt was settled, but the report does not explicitly clarify that the balance is now {$0.00}. If it was settled, the balance should reflect {$0.00}.

- **Last Payment Date** : The last payment is marked as "" XX/XX/year>, '' but the "" Balance Updated '' date is "" XX/XX/year>, '' which could suggest the balance wasnt updated immediately after payment. 
- **Responsibility** : The term "" 1 Month Individual Responsibility '' seems confusing. Typically, responsibility would state whether the account is "" Individual '' or "" Joint, '' and "" 1 Month '' may not be relevant here.

- **Debt Buyer** : If the account was sold, the name of the company that bought the debt is missing.

3. **Consumer Statement** : - The phrase "" ITEM IN DISPUTE BY CONSUMER '' indicates that this account is disputed, but there is no further information regarding what is being disputed or the resolution status.

I dispute the legitimacy and accuracy of this debt, and I believe Spring Oak Capital is in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I request that this debt be removed from my credit report immediately for the following reasons : 1. Violation of FDCPA ( 15 U.S. Code 1692g ) Failure to Provide Validation of Debt : Spring Oak Capital has failed to provide me with proper validation of the alleged debt. Under FDCPA, I have the right to request and receive validation, including detailed information about the origin, validity, and amount of the debt. Despite my request, Spring Oak Capital has not provided this information, and they continue to

report this debt on my credit report. 2. Violation of FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ) Inaccurate Reporting : Spring Oak Capital is reporting inaccurate information on my credit report in violation of the FCRA. Since the debt has not been validated and I dispute its legitimacy, this inaccurate reporting is harmful and should be corrected immediately. The FCRA mandates that furnishers of information, such as debt collectors, ensure that all information provided to credit reporting agencies is accurate and complete. Failing to verify the debt before reporting it is a clear violation. 
3. Right to Dispute under the FCRA : I have submitted formal disputes to the credit reporting agencies regarding this debt, yet Spring Oak Capital continues to furnish the disputed information without properly investigating the dispute, as required under the FCRA. This failure to conduct a reasonable investigation violates my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ).",,"Spring Oaks Capital, LLC",TX,77477,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10059581

2024-09-08,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I had been recommended by XXXX to go to XXXX XXXX to get my "" computer '' ( XXXX ) fixed. XXXX had given them detailed information about the issue. This was supposed to be related to my check engine light having turned on, with overheating being the primary issue. In total, it took an entire month for me to get my car back with the check engine light turning on a couple hours after picking it up. They had my mother pay {$500.00} for the part, only to tell her that they did not need it ; this is part of what had taken so much time. During the weekly phone calls with XXXX XXXX XXXX, or my mother, would make to check the status, we found that they hadn't started work. Initially it was a struggle to just get them to order the part I needed. I immediately called them after the light turned on to let them know, and they asked me to bring the car back. I refused, and asked for a refund as I didn't want to spend any more time or money on this business. They did not agree to the refund and continued to suggest I bring the car back. 

This is despite knowing that I had just XXXX  and needed to leave the state in a couple weeks. XXXX another indefinite amount of time for my car was not possible. I had filed a dispute with Discover that was initially found in my favor on XX/XX/XXXX, and the amount was credited. However, this was recently reversed because XXXX XXXX provided documentation that shows I signed for the purchase. This doesn't change the fact that the service I paid for was essentially not provided ( details in documentation ). 

The "" computer '' despite being replaced was found to not be working by another repair shop and throwing the same errors that it had when I brought it to XXXX XXXX. I no longer think Discover is going to be a reliable means of communicating this information and would just like to be given a refund. I had to junk the car not soon after, because of further related issues. Important dates are in the documentation. 

Initially, after I had submitted documentation, the case had been put in my favor and I had been credited the refund. However, Discover reversed this after XXXX XXXX had provided their own information. They had sent me a copy of this information, and it did not disprove or override any of my documentation. 

The representative that answered the phone on both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( same person ) in the department dealing with disputes, had not given me any concrete reason for the case being reversed in their favor. The woman initially claimed it was because I signed for the purchase, which they had known the entire time. During the second call, her answer had changed to say it was because I had never contacted them about the issue. This had not been proven. XXXX had only provided the phone records between my mother and XXXX battery, as they had asked her to order a part. This part was not the correct part and was another instance of this company mishandling my car and being dismissive of my time. 

XXXX battery had not provided any actual evidence that they had done the service correctly, only that they asked me to bring the car back to them. Discover was not able to answer for this in any meaningful way, and the representative on the phone refused to continue the dispute as I had asked. Discover had emailed me saying that I could continue the dispute if requested, but this representative still refused. I can not remember her name, but she seems to be XXXX of only a few people in this department that answers the phones. 

I was only able to request a second review over the online chat option. This also does not have an explanation from Discover. I am currently waiting for the phone records from my own phone company so that I can send them to Discover ( showing I did contact XXXX immediately after picking up the car ), but as they are handling the case now it XXXX not make any difference.",,"CAPITAL ONE, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION - GREENWOOD DELAWARE BRANCH",WI,53703,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10051808

Specifically, I have identified several violations and omissions that invalidate the loan agreement under this federal law : Lack of Full Disclosure of Installment Loan Agreement I did not receive a complete copy of the installment loan agreement at the time of signing. TILA requires that creditors provide borrowers with clear and detailed information regarding the loan terms, including the amount financed, the payment schedule, and the total cost of the loan. I did not receive adequate documentation of these key terms, which constitutes a violation of TILA 's disclosure requirements.

Failure to Provide Notice of Security Interest There was no clear disclosure or explanation that a security interest would be placed on the vehicle as part of the loan agreement. Under TILA, creditors are required to inform borrowers if a security interest is being taken on collateral, in this case, my vehicle, in exchange for the loan. Without this disclosure, the creditor has failed to comply with the legal requirement to fully inform me of my rights and obligations under the loan. 

Undisclosed Lien on Vehicle I was not informed of any lien placed on my vehicle at the time the loan was extended. The Truth in Lending Act mandates that creditors disclose any liens or encumbrances that will be attached to the collateral in the transaction. The failure to disclose the lien renders the agreement incomplete and noncompliant with TILA regulations.

Lack of Disclosure of Finance Charges The finance charge for this loan was not properly disclosed at the time of the agreement. Under TILA, the finance charge, including the total cost of interest and any other fees associated with the loan, must be clearly communicated to the borrower before the loan agreement is signed. The omission of this essential information violates my rights as a consumer under federal law.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,CREDIT ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION,MS,395XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10055395

I called Total about my account. I just made an additional {$100.00} payment when they said there was a XXXX XXXX of available credit. The payment showed with a {$190.00} balance & a {$300.00} credit limit. My adult daughter called the automated phone service earlier that day because I had issued a card in her name. She said that automated phone Service said there was XXXX credit available. My app for the card said {$100.00} credit available. After being on hold for over a half hour, someone finally answered, but their voice kept cutting in and out. I asked them if they could adjust something so I could hear them. I did hear them and then they hung up on me. Callback request, even though they said there was XXXX time on the automatic recording when you were on hold. ( Of course for the entire whole process, I went through one or 210 minutes of wait time and five or six XXXX minutes wait time. ) So I figured the callback option was best 90 minutes after waiting I fell asleep. My phone never received any call to this day. They still have not called back. I tried Contacting the issuing bank, the XXXX XXXX XXXX  on their webpage they had a contact form and they listed total. The card issue were on that contact page. Try to explain the situation to them. They didnt reply so I tried again. They did reply a day or so later basically saying not our problem deal with the credit card company. The issue Im having is theyre not responding and I cant be on hold my entire life last I checked they now said I had a XXXX  dollars and change even though there have been no purchases since the last payment. My daughter thinks these are charge hold on order. She was going to make through maybe XXXX or something like that, but arent they supposed to go away after a few days? Ive been in good standing with this company never missing a payment since the account was open. I believe it was years ago. ( They actually deactivated the card for lack of usage and then when I requested it be reactivated thats when I decided to let my daughter use it to help her out. ) It just doesnt make sense if I have a balance of XXXX with a {$300.00} limit and I paid them {$100.00} which they have collected and taken from my bank account why theyre collecting my money and not letting the card be used. Not returning my calls! ( Since you have to verify who you are with your account details on the automated phones system before you speak to someone on the phone in person, they should have your information so if the call is disconnected, they could call you back if they want it you ask them to call you back, which they basically dont feel like it seems.",Company believes the complaint provided an opportunity to answer consumer's questions,"Total Card, Inc.",FL,330XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10059145

Specifically, there are illegal late payments listed that I have disputed multiple times. I followed the appropriate dispute process by providing documentation and a detailed explanation to support my claim that these late payments are inaccurate and should not appear on my credit report. 

Despite my repeated efforts, Equifax has refused to conduct a proper investigation or correct the errors, which is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This incorrect information is negatively impacting my credit score, and I am seeking resolution to this matter. 

Actions taken : I initially submitted a dispute on XX/XX/year>, providing all relevant documentation to support my claim that the reported late payments are inaccurate. I sent a letter to Equifax that was notarized and certified. 

On XX/XX/year>, I received either a letter from Equifax that the documentation which was my social security card and my drivers license are illegal and they sent a refusal to investigate the matter. 

Equifax has failed to meet its legal obligation to investigate the dispute, as outlined in the FCRA. 

**Desired resolution : ** I am requesting that the CFPB intervene to ensure that Equifax complies with its obligation to investigate the dispute and remove the inaccurate information from my credit report.

The check is a life insurance benefit check that I receive from the insurance company due to my dads death. I was the beneficiary. The plan was to cash the check since it was drawn on Chase, but they were unable to just cash it because the amount. I was splitting it with my mom and little brother. To help my mom get caught up on bills, and with my brother because I know my dad didnt intentionally leave my brother out of an inheritance. He always wanted to make sure that we were okay. Nobody knows the time or day and we definitely didnt expect to be without my dad this soon in life but he did something to make sure that we were okay in the event that something happened to him and now those funds are unjustly being held. They couldnt cash the check due to the amount. At the assistant managers direction, she told me to sign the check over to my mom and for us to deposit it into my moms Chase account, which we did. This is the banks manager, we didnt think twice about it, because the manager is trying to find the best solution and knows how things operate. We were told about a standard hold which we were okay with. My moms account was flagged for fraud due to the check being signed over. Fraud is far from the case, no ill will or bad intentions. My mom was told about the verification process so we got a phone in my name to try to comply and get the situation resolved. I just recently turned XXXX, I have no credit or anything. I was supposed to get my first car with that money and invest in my future. The manager called the department or back office on our behalf stating that we we were directed by her to deposit the check. She sent an escalation stating the same thing and explaining the situation. My mom have been making a lot of calls as well. We lost my dad on XXXX XXXX  of all days, time does not heal or make it easier, we are still grieving and distraught over losing him and now we are in a battle for the insurance inheritance check and we did absolutely nothing wrong. The check cleared fairly quickly, Im assuming because it is the same bank. My mom has sent over documents, took documents in the branch, branch managers have called on our behalf. This isnt right on so many levels. It is causing emotional and financial distress. They cant verify my phone number or me in their system but we have provided proof. I am fresh into XXXX  so any type of verification other than in person with valid identification probably wont work right now. When they first flagged my moms account the insurance company offered to stop payment but the check had already cleared.

I notified them immediately that they did not have the right to levy my account as it is shared with a third party, and has protected funds in it. They instead opted to pursue another payment plan. I have repeatedly proposed and called and sent letters about settling the debt- with no answer. They have not properly notified me of my debts in the amount or status of the debt and have also failed to notify me of pursuing legal action. They are unresponsive to most requests and this seems to be a common complaint amongst their XXXX reviews.

I can't even walk into a branch to speak to someone directly. Every time I call the number they provide ( XXXX ), I get routed overseas, which adds to my frustration. Explaining my situation to someone in another country who cant truly help, and then being unable to get transferred to someone who can, is wearing me down. I can't take this back-and-forth with Citizens Bank any longer . Then not being able to visit a local branch for any help. Its just awful. Try being in my shoesalone, with no one to help, and trying to navigate this nightmare of a process. Every step feels like a brick wall. No one at Citizens Bank is there when I need them. I cant even walk into a branch and talk to someone face-to-face. Instead, I call their number ( XXXX ) and get routed overseas to someone who cant help, who doesnt even understand the situation, and Im stuck explaining my struggles over and over again, getting nowhere. 

Letters continue to come in, first saying they need more information, then saying my modification is under review. This has been dragging on for nine months, and it's showing up on my credit score. Its unbelievable to me that Im being held to a score in a system that feels broken while Im just trying to stay afloat. My situation is serious, and I need Citizens Bank to either lower my interest rate or, at this point, even consider erasing the loan. The stress has become overwhelming. 

Citizens Bank rejected my modification because I missed their tight deadlineI wasnt even home when the package arrived. I returned it late, but giving just six days, including a holiday and weekend, is simply unreasonable. I had no idea the package was coming, and I was out of town. 

Ive been trying to work with the bank since XXXX, and all Im asking for is some understanding. I want to stay in my home, but now XXXX being forced to start this grueling process all over again. I need Citizens Bank to step in, lower my interest rate, or seriously consider erasing the loan. I can't handle much more of this.

2024-09-08,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"To whom it may concern, Hello, First, thank you very much for reviewing our complaint. It means a lot to us. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, our house got foreclosed by Mr Cooper ( former known as Nationstar bank ) and we believe that this is a wrongful foreclosure.

1. They miss-led us After we received the notice of Trust Sale date, we contacted the bank to see if they can hold the trust sale date. They advised on the phone that if we can send a signed Purchase Agreement and the buyer 's Proof of Fund then they will hold the trust sale date to give us time to close the Escrow. 

Our house value now is around {$1.00} XXXX and the amount we owe is {>= $1,000,000}. The house value is well above the amount we owe, so we would have no problem paying off what we owe to the bank if we have time to sell the house. 

Because bank told us that they can postpone the sale date, we primarily focused on finding the buyer. 

We finally found the buyer who offered {$1.00} XXXX and all Cash transaction and submitted the documents to the bank. We even opened an escrow on this property and it was going to close on XX/XX/XXXX. 

At the last moment, one day before the foreclosure date, the bank declined our request to postpone the sale date. We called many, many times to postpone the sale date and they replied "" The loan is too old and we can not postpone the sale date. '' The loan was old from the beginning and they could have told us that from the beginning then we could have focused on the other options. But they were giving us false hope to keep us from looking elsewhere. 

They proceeded with foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX and now the Mr Cooper owns the property. 

We strongly believe that this bank did this on purpose to keep us from seeking another alternative and they can foreclose on the house. Making us believe that foreclosure can be postponed and don't look for another alternatives, and decline at the last minute so we don't have any other option. One representative even told us that he worked there for 21 years and he has NEVER seen a foreclose date postponed. We strongly believe that this is how this Mr Cooper operates to rob the houses from the distress home owner and make even bigger profit. We sincerely ask your help to look into their business practices to see if they really postpone the sale date. Or they try to lure customers into believing that the trust sale date can be postponed and keep them from finding another alternatives. 


2. This dis Dual Tracking. 

Me and my wife were trying so hard to keep this house so we sent Mr Cooper Loan Modification Package multiple times so they can modify the loan. On the date they recorded a trust sale date, XX/XX/XXXX, the modification package that we sent on XX/XX/XXXX was still under review. This modification package was declined on XX/XX/XXXX which is 14 days after they recorded Trust Sale. We even sent the Modification package on XX/XX/XXXX. Can they proceed with Trust Sale Date when the Loan Modification Package is under review? Isnt this in violation of dual tracking? ( RESPA 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( g ) ( 2014 ). This prohibited practice proceeding with a foreclosure sale while processing a complete loan modification application submitted at least 37 days before the scheduled sale is known as dual tracking. ) 3. Hardship My wife was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX years ago and we had to travel back and forth to XXXX to get treatment. She went through XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, etc. When they notified us of foreclosure sale date, which was 1 month prior to the foreclosure date, we explained many times and sent proof that we are experiencing extreme hardship, they would not accept it as the reason to postpone the sale date. They told us that only way to hold the foreclosure is to send them the Purchase Agreement and the buyer 's Proof of fund.

Unfortunately, we do not have the record of the phone conversations with them. They would record our conversation but if we record it, then they would not speak to us. But please find enclosed documents that prove that we had purchase agreement before the sale date and we have opened an escrow. We sincerely ask your help and look into this matter. Please help us get our house back so we can sell the house and pay the bank what we owe.

In the parking lot was a XXXX truck with a bunch of signs about XXXX XXXX steaks for {$40.00}. She wanted to see what the deal was. This company XXXX XXXX was having a meat sale in the XXXX parking lot and the salesman spoke to my wife and told her all the ribeyes were sold out and he said he had a better deal and talked her into buying a box of meat valued at {$1300.00} for {$200.00}. The company took my credit card and used a device to scan my credit card and said I would receive a text message receipt from XXXX. 15 minutes after leaving I received a text message receipt for {$470.00} and my wife wanted to go back immediately and return the meat for a refund. The salesman said if I read the bottom of the text message receipt it shows ALL SALES ARE FINAL he said he would need to speak to his manager whos not in XXXX Florida but is located in XXXX, Alabama. I gave him the box of meat back and demanded a refund for being charged {$270.00} more than the {$200.00} he said it would be. He said he would do something that would be getting him into trouble with his boss and keep the box of meat and refund me the {$470.00}. He said the refund would take 5-7 days and I would receive a receipt of the refund. I never received the refund and I contacted the company over 20 times and they never answered the phone and never returned any of my phone calls. 5 business days after not receiving a refund, I contacted Citi Credit on XX/XX/year> and opened a dispute and Citi refunded my money and opened an investigation and the company responded to them saying I didnt follow protocol for the refund.

This situation has caused significant distress, as I believe it is rooted in a misunderstanding related to fraudulent activities that have affected my identity since XXXX. 

As a victim of identity theft, I have taken numerous steps to prevent further fraudulent actions against my name. However, despite my efforts, it seems that my legitimate accounts have been unfairly affected, leading to their closure. I kindly request that you conduct a thorough investigation into my case, focusing on the removal of any fraudulent accounts associated with my identity. 

I urge you to reinstate my credentials in your database, ensuring that all records reflect only my legitimate account activities. It is essential for me to regain access to my Cash App services, as they are vital for my financial transactions. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt resolution. Thank you for your understanding and support in addressing this issue.

The Credit Reporting Agencies are showing inconsistencies with each other and as well as showing Account Status inconsistencies with the furnisher, Self Financial Inc./ LEAD Bank , clearly violating my rights protected under the FCRA XXXX Which, as we know is to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of my consumer report and is the ASSUMED responsibility of the CRAs. Given the sheer number of inaccuracies reported and the impact that continuing to entrust this responsibility of reporting this account, XXXX have a negative impact on my ability to obtain credit in the future. As it is ultimately MY responsibility to ensure that my NPPI, consumer report, and reputation is properly protected and maintained. I wrote a letter on XX/XX/XXXX addressed to SELF INC., giving notice of my right to opt out and instruction on reporting certain nonpublic personal information on my consumer report covered under the privacy act of XXXX. 

My intention is to maintain a working relationship with SELF INC., and All CRAs. However this CAN NOT continue to be tolerated. Under no circumstances should there be this many violations on a public record. All exhibits and evidence are outlined in the attachments of this compliant.

The orchestration of towing the cars off the referenced property was TOTALLY PREMEDITATED, EGREGIOUS AND VINDICTIVE. 

As it pertains to the XXXX XXXX I was forced to take out a loan in order to keep my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX being notified of IDENTITY THEFT AND A VICTIM of various FORMS OF FRAUD INCLUDING MORTGAGE AND OTHER. Both myself and husband. 

My previous business partner, XXXX. walked out on me and the XXXX AGENCIES. After further investigation he was money laundering and committing embezzlement utilizing BOTH XXXX XXXX FOR CHANGE THROUGH XXXX XXXX, AND THE ATTACHMENT AND BONDING CENTER IF XXXX XXXX. After he left EVERY AUDITING AGENCY CAME AFTER THE AGENCIES CITING FRAUD AND MORE LIES IN ORDER TO SHUT DOWN ALL OF THE AGENCIES TO COVER ALL XXXX ACTIVITIES HE COMMITTED WITH Judges, Attorneys and Real Estate Brokers. 


I filed Bankruptcy and because he was XXXX XXXX  and I was XXXX XXXX they actually contacted him and NEVER QUESTIONED HIS ACTIONS BECAUSE THE XXXX HAD TO COVER THEIR COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS OTHER KNOWN PARTIES WERE RECEIVING the money through the agency as XXXX. ARRANGED. Yes, all documents and more were submitted to federal and state agencies, but yet he is still committing crimes via third party. 

My husband filed XXXX in order, we thought, to stop the theft of Real Property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Ga XXXX. My husband took a loan with XXXX with TITLEMAX to assist my agency to stay open DUE TO THE VINDICTIVE actions taken by the State of Georgia to destroy myself and the agencies for the purposes of cover all committed fraud. 

As it pertains to the XXXX XXXX THE TITLEMAX LOAN WAS PAID OFF via bankruptcy. As far as the XXXX XXXX the loan was paid off. The assigned TRUSTEE XXXX XXXX EGREGIOUSLY OBTAINED AN ILLEGAL COURT ORDER AFTER MY HUSBAND BRC WAS DISMISSED AND CONTACTED STATEWIDE TOW SERVICE TO COME TO THE HOME, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX GA XXXX, which was also stolen and transported to XXXX XXXX Ga LOCATED IN XXXX XXXX GA. It took my husband almost a week to locate the car. The car should have NEVER been picked up. Once located the car appeared to have been involved in a possible robbery or shootout as there was blood all in the car. A police report was filed with XXXX XXXX POLICE DEPARTMENT. 

The car was located at the TRUSTEES AUCTION!. Well, the tables have turned. When we were evicted in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The LEGAL CROOKS TO INCLUDE COURT OFFICIALS, TITLEMAX ATTORNEYS, XXXX XXXX POLICE, XXXX XXXX XXXX AND XXXX OFFICIALS ARRANGED FOR THE ILLEGAL EVICTION AND WENT IN THE HOME WHILE WE WERE OUT APPROXIMATELY XXXX minutes away and destroyed the home looking for the keys to both cars.

XXXX OF THE XXXX XXXX  MARSHALLS DEPUTIES ENTERED THE HOUSE AND TOOK KEYS IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM TOWED BY STATEWIDE BEFOIRE WE MADE IT BVACK TO THE HOUSE.

FURTHER RESEARCH REGARDING TITLEMAX SHOWS A HISTORY OF EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS FRAUDULENTLY TAKING OUT LOANS AGAINST CUSTOMERS CARS NUMERSOUS TIMES.BECAUSE WE HAVE PROOF PARTIES IN XXXX XXXX AND OTHER COUNTIES, WERE TALKNG OUT LOANS AGAINST BOTH VEHICLES SINCE PURCHASE. THIS WAS A PART OF THE XXXX TO DAMAGE US, IN ORDER TO ME TO NOT PUT THE PUZZLE TOGETHER. 

The issue of allowing title pawns to charge excessive INTEREST IS DUE TO CUSTOMERS PAYING FOR TITLEMAX ENGAGING IN TITLE FRAUD. ALL OF THE CROOKS ARE STEALING MONEY UTILIZING CUSTOMERS CARS. So, of course the interest rate is RIDICULOUS AND CUSTOMERS START OVER EVERY MONTH IF THE LOAN IS NOT PAID OUT IN XXXX STARTS OVER IN ORDER FOR CROOKS WITHIN THE LEGAL COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TAKING OUT LOANS AGAINST CUSTIMERS CARS. 

The pretense of the STATE OF GEORGIA fining TITKEMAX XXXX  of dollars by XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX is a lie. They are not being fined. The fine is being pocketed by XXXX and the XXXX. TITLE MAX BEHAVIORS STILL CONTINUES AND ALL LOCATIONS NEED TO BE RAIDED XXXX THE IRS, FBI AND OTHERS AND SHUT DOWN. THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPAY ALL MONIES BACK TO ALL CONSUMERS. IF THEIR CARS WERE SOLD TITLE MAX SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR ADDITIONAL DAMAGES. 

Bottomline, TITLEMAX NET WORTH Increases and XXXX  of dollars in the pockets of these XXXX The STATE OF GEORGIA allows it because from the top down This is STRAIGHT XXXX PAWN FRAUD AT ITS FINEST! THE HOUSE WASSTOLEN BY XXXX  FROM XXXX WHO WORK WITH THE JUDGES, STATEWIDE TOWING. WE COULD NOT LOCATE THE XXXX IMMEDIATELY WHICH IS 1.VEHICLE THEFT 2.

THIS WAS A HOME XXXX ORDERED BY XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX SHERIFF WITH A XXXX HISTORY. HE AND THE XXXX  PAID THE SAME DEPUTIES WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH ALL OF THE XXXX XXXX ILLEGAL EVICTION TO TEAR THE HOME UP IN ORDER TO RETREIVETHE KEYS FOR TOWING. THEY ALL WERE PAID BY TITLEMAX! THIS IS THE NORM FOR TITLEMAX AND THEIR OPERATIONS. 

ACCORDING TO THE XXXX CODES WHICH ARE APPLICABLE ; XXXX. ANY LOANS MADE DO NOT COME FROM THE LOAN COMPANY OR PAWN COMPANY. IT COMES FROM XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX UNDER A PERSON 'S SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. THE CONTRACT IN THIS CASE ACTS AS THE NOTE AND THE MONEY IS IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED TO TITLEMAX FORM THE XXXX XXXX XXXX  ACCOUNT AS STATED. THE LOAN SHOIULD NEVER BE PAID BACK AS THE INDIVIDUALS IS THE CREDITOR. 
. 
XXXX. TITLEMAX DOES NOT EXPLAIN TO THE CUSTOMERS THE RESCIND PERIOD WHEN A LOAN IS OBTAINED, THEREFORE EXPLOITATING THE CONSUMER TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE THEY CAN NOT CANCEL THE LOAD WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD. 

3.CONTRACTS ARE FRAUDULENT. TITLEMAX RECEIVED A TOTAL PAYMENT OF XXXX TO XXXX PER APPLICATION PER CREDITOR/BORROWER. 

XXXX, TITLEMAX IS COMMITTING EXTORTION BY CONTINOUSLY STARTING THE CREDITORS/BORROWERS CONTRACT OVER EVERY 30 DAYS IF NOT PAIED IN FULL. THIS GIVES TITLEMAX MORE TIME FOR TAKE OUT FRAUDULUENT LOANS AGAINST CUSTOMERS VEHICLES. 

XXXX. TITLE MAX BEGIN TAKING OUT LOANS ON VEHICLES WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL PURCHASES A VEHICLE. I DO QUESTION IF TITLEMAX IS IN WITH MANY OF THE AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIP WITHIN THE SURROUNDING AREA. PURCHASES A VEHICLE AS DATED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE REPORT WE OBTAINED.

2024-09-08,Debt or credit management,Debt settlement,Didn't provide services promised,,"I began using Tally in XX/XX/XXXX to manage my credit card debt. Initially, they provided a lower interest rate ( 18 % ) than my existing rate, and from XXXX to XXXX, they delivered on their promises. However, in XXXX, Tally raised the interest rate to 22 %, which undermined their original offer of debt relief. Once linked, Tally would sometimes "" buy out '' debt without explicit notice. While the option to turn this off may have been buried in the app settings, there should be more explicit permission given to transfer over $ XXXX worth of debt overnight. 

Recently, I was informed that Tally was going bankrupt, and my account was sold to a third-party collection agency. This company has locked in the higher interest rate and is now planning to report the debt to credit agencies, which will negatively affect my credit score. Additionally, they are charging new fees ( $ XXXX {$10.00} ) for every payment! 

Tally initially promised a way out of debt by not reporting to credit agencies and offering a lower interest rate. This abrupt change in terms feels like a bait-and-switch tactic that will significantly harm my financial standing. I had worked diligently to pay down my debt between XXXX and XXXX and would have cleared it entirely if I had known Tally would sell my account to a private debt collector with such unfavorable terms. Furthermore, the consumer reports for the new company seem to indicate poor administrative strategies, commonly resulting in incorrect numbers being reported or payments not being counted correctly and promptly.

These violations have caused significant harm to my financial status, disenfranchised me from fair credit opportunities, and infringed on my right to privacy.

Violations of 15 USC 1666b ( Credit Billing Act ) The credit reporting agencies have failed to provide timely corrections or deletions of disputed information, including negative and outdated entries, closed accounts, and inaccurate addresses. Despite my attempts to resolve these matters, they continue to report incorrect information without following proper procedures under this statute. 

Violations of 15 USC 1691 and 12 CFR 1002 ( Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B ) TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX have unlawfully shared my personal and financial information with banks, loan companies, and other institutions without my explicit written consent. These actions violate my rights under the ECOA and Regulation B, further restricting my access to credit and loans.

Violations of 15 USC 1692c ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ) These agencies have continued to share inaccurate information with third parties after I explicitly requested they cease such activity. This violates 15 USC 1692c, which governs the conduct of information sharing without the consumers consent, leading to ongoing financial hardship and privacy breaches.

Violations of 15 USC 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ) TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX have failed to comply with key provisions of the FCRA : 1681b They lacked permissible purposes to access or distribute my credit report and provided negative information without my authorization.

1681e They did not follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information reported, resulting in negative entries that I have previously disputed.

1681c The agencies failed to remove outdated and inaccurate information, including closed accounts and former addresses.

1681n & 1681o These agencies willfully and negligently failed to comply with the FCRA, resulting in ongoing financial harm to me.

Violations of 15 USC 6801 ( Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) The agencies violated the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act by failing to protect my nonpublic personal information, sharing it with third parties without my explicit consent, and not providing me with the necessary protections outlined under 6801.

Violations of 15 USC 45 ( FTC Act ) Their actions constitute unfair and deceptive practices under the FTC Act ( 15 USC 45 ).

On XX/XX/year> I went to see a veterinarian looking for the best one to treat my bird, XXXX, whom I had for XXXX  years. This was a third opinion and this vet knew that.

I stopped my search for the most qualified vet then because he told me there were no others. Not true. He, ade me do expensive tests to determine if she would be ok for XXXX. That visit was {$330.00}. 

He called me a couple of days later telling me that she was ok for XXXX. I scheduled XXXX for the XXXX of XXXX. She never woke up after XXXX. XXXX months later, when I finally was given her medical records, her test results showed she was not ok for XXXX. He lied to me to get the sale, {$1500.00}. 30 days later only because I told them to, they credited me around {$250.00}. The total amounts in question are {$330.00} and {$1200.00}. 

A lot happens in between. 

I then started contacting Care Credit through Synchrony bank. Disputing the charges base on being lied to and his failure to provide the expected care from the expert he claimed to be and the only reason I let him care for the most important thing in my life. 

Synchrony bank refused to work with me and closed my account and turned me over to collections. My credit score went from a XXXX to a XXXX. 

I contacted synchrony corporate office and explained the problem. I sent them a thick envelope full of proof and they sided with the doctor based on one paragraph of lies. This vet uses these deceptive practices on other clients as well. I sent them all the proof they would need and even offered my phone records to prove that the doctors office was lying. 

Synchrony has denied my claim and my credit score has suffered because I refuse to pay for someone to receive me and be wreck less with my precious bird.

Truist decided to provide XXXX of the most blatant untruths and farce reasons for their denial. Its disheartening. 

XXXX denial reason-Because our business is XXXX hrs from where the home is being built Truist decided that hiring a new employee will have a negative impact on our business, therefore they could not use our joint income of $ XXXX. Are you serious? Businesses are operated from all over the Country and this was their excuse? My husband and I are the only XXXX employees of our company and I provided a letter of explanation prior to the denial advising that we would simply hire a driver to drive our dump truck. Its the easiest business to operate when youre XXXX XXXX  and XXXX and all you need is a driver. However, Truist used this as a denial reason. This reasoning was thrown against the wall to see if it would stick and they should be embarrassed. 

XXXX denial reason- We co-signed for our daughter to purchase a vehicle XX/XX/XXXX. Her car payment is $ XXXX. We sent bank statements showing how the money is transferred from my daughters account into our joint account each month and the payment is automatically drafted by the lender. We provided this information so that the {$270.00} was not included as part of our debt. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an e mail from our loan officer, XXXX XXXX, advising that the car payment was NOT counted as part of our debt yet Truist claimed it was our debt and used it as a reason for the denial. How misleading and deceptive is that? If they decided to count the {$270.00} as debt, we still could afford the loan with the amount of income we receive monthly as well as over {>= $1,000,000} in assets. This denial reason is without merit and again, Truist should be embarrassed XXXX denial reason- Truist advised that you are not allowed to show a late payment on your mortgage within 24 months and that we had a 30 day late payment on our HELOC. A HELOC is not a mortgage, its a loan so they misspoke. However, I checked all of my credit reports and we do not have XXXX late payment since we acquired our HELOC in XXXX so where did this magically appeared denial reason come from? Truist has no proof of this. How can you be a XXXX XXXX dollar company and deny potential customers based on untruths? 

WHY did Truist do this to us and why did we submit information for a month in a half just to receive the above denial reasons? Why were we dragged like rag dolls then disposed of? WHY? 

Ill tell you why. The denial was derived out of prejudice towards a too good to be true situation and the injustices that XXXX and XXXX people have and continue to endure daily. We worked extremely hard during this process and without delay, just to be denied for the above reasons that are not only blatant untruths but prejudicial. 

How do you deny someone who met EVER requirement? HOW? 

We are a successful XXXXXXXX XXXX  couple that was taken through the wringer and hung to dry. There are so many unfair lending practices that occurred during this process and its all in writing..from XXXX XXXX withdrawing our application citing my Husband didnt sign disclosures within 15 days when she never gave us a timeframe. Furthermore, it was because of her that he could not sign the documents ( documents would not load to our online portal ) .We were in constant communication about these disclosures yet without warning, she sent an e mail XX/XX/XXXX withdrawing our application and recommended that we reach out to our builder for assistance in finding a new lenderand this was after i sent an e mail asking for a status update. My mouth was agape. I had to reach out to her XXXX, XXXX XXXX, who had to reinstate our application due to XXXX wrongfully terminating our loan. If we were not fighters and had given up, our loan process would have ended that day. 

There are so many other time stamped issues that occurred during this process that was deceptive, misleading, lacked transparency such as lowering our loan amount ( by {$90000.00} ) without a reason. I had to ask for an explanation and told that our XXXX wasnt high enough. However, we had already gotten approved based on our XXXX falling within their guidelines. WHAT? This was all happening to us after sending hundreds of pages of documents. The discriminatory nature of how this process transpired is not only prejudicial but a true testament of how unfair lending practices are allowed to occur right in front of our faces. 

Many people do not know how to express this type of treatment. However, Im not one of those people. This process has caused me a lot of anxiety and stress. I am recovering from XXXX so stressful situations trigger XXXXXXXX XXXX  and other ailments that I can not afford to deal with yet Truist has put me in a bad physical and mental space. Im taking a maintenance XXXX XXXX  daily as well as have follow up appointments with my Oncologist monthly for lab work to ensure my XXXX has not return as there is no cure for my type of XXXX ( Multiple XXXX  ). 

I must continue to fight for what is right and Im pleading to your organization to assist me in righting the wrong that has been caused by Truist Bank.

At that time my lease was about to expire ; and the leasing office sent me a noticed to renew, I was not going to renew this lease ; However, I was sent a text by management, that if they lowered my lease amount, would I reconsider staying ; I replied back that I would, I also told them about the Loud music. I really did not know that it was the guy above for sure, but I was told that they would address it. A few months later, I noticed that the noise was starting only when the tenant upstairs came home from work, I called the leasing office, to inform them, that it was in fact the tenant above. Before they called me back, they call the guy upstairs to ask him if it was him, He told them no. They chose to believe him instead of me. A few mounts past, I was working ; However, I got laid off a my job, so I began to do some work at home. One evening, when the guy above me came home, the music began, I don't know was it was, I was watching television, I just decided to turn off my power for the television, and the music stopped ; I was shocked. So from then on, I started doing this everyday. I went to my cable company to let them know what was going on, and they suggested that I change boxes, So I did< several time. This did not work. I requested a that they send someone out to check if this guy was hacking into my cable, I was told that he was not ; I became more frighten ; All the while I was sending weekly information to the office of what was going on, they did nothing to try to investigate this issue ; I am XXXX XXXX XXXX, and live alone, I began to get stressed. I could not figure out what he was doing. Our unit were designed with the same layout. One night I came home ; I decided to test my electricity, so I tuned off my circuit breakers, I could hear upstairs in his unit that everything upstairs has also stopped. His unit had wood floors, and he was a heavy set guy, so I could also hear him walking around in his unit, and what part of the unit that he was in. When the breakers went off, I could hear him moving around in the one area, it sounded as if he was working on something. I was so scared that I called the police, and made and complaint, I was also sending management information about what was going on ; and instead of them trying to check out anything, they chose to try to find anything, and everything to complain about me. I started turning my breaker off before going to work, and coming home in the dark. Still management did nothing. the last thing that made me decide to leave was, one night I came home, I was so tired, I took my shower, fix something to eat, and went to bed, however, I noticed that my A.C. was not running, I always leave my air running ; this is Texas, and it is always hot here. I tried to turn the temperature down so that the A.C. would kick on, it did not ; so I changed the batteries, still nothing happen, I went to sleep, thinking that it would start back on it's own : About XXXX XXXX, I woke up after hearing the guy upstairs pacing the floor, when I noticed that I was sweating, I got up, went to look at the A.C ; it was at 85 degrees.

The representative reiterated that they base interest on the average balance of previous month statements. I asked if I paid my balance in full and made no charges, would I still be charged interest regardless of no purchases being made. I reiterated again that it does not make sense that Capital One has the ability to charge interest of charges already paid.

I already have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which, along with most advertised credit cards today, does not charge foreign transaction fees. 

When I went away on vacation last month, Chase quietly racked up Foreign Transaction Fees on my account, without notifying me. Foreign Transaction Fees are not clearly stated on the website, in any advertising for the card. I get emails and letters constantly from Chase, and text messages, they could have and should have told me my charges overseas were incurring foreign transaction fees. 

ESPECIALLY since I have another chase card! They should have immediately messaged me to tell me that my transactions were incurring fees and that I should consider using my other card. 

These charges occurred between XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year> totaling {$110.00} When I called Chase after getting home, twice, they were obstinate and refused to overturn the charges or refund me. This is RIDICULOUS. I am charged hundreds of dollars per year for all three of my Chase credit cards. It is ridiculous and unfair to charge foreign transaction fees in addition, stealing money from consumers, when these should be CLEARLY STATED on the website, marketing materials and inside of my chase portal. I should also have received notice and warning about incurring these fees instead of them sneakily ending up on my statement.

I have already been scammed out of {$91.00} for cheap, stained and used garments, DISCOVER is asking me to spend more money to send the package to an unknown, very long and suspicious address in XXXX with the hope I will be refunded. I have absolutely no faith in the scammer who does business in US by 2 names ( XXXX  ) and ( XXXX  ) and operates from 3 different addresses that they will refund me XXXX XXXX out of my {$91.00}. 
The address they asked me to return the garments is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is obvious to the naked eye that this is a fake, made up address and I will not risk paying expensive postage to mail the counterfeit garments, UNLESS Discover guarantees me that if the SCAMMER does not refund me my money, the credit card will.

To make matters even more stressful for me, DISCOVER banned me from communicating with them by phone because "" I was not respectful in my phone communications to their reps '', and forcing me again to communicate via fax ( which I do not have ) and mail at my cost. 
I wrote a letter to DISCOVER 's Executive office of Customer Advocacy explaining how I feel I have been mistreated by their reps in being shoved from extension to extension and made to repeat again, and again the reason of my calls and what I was trying to accomplish and never once they admitted that the DISCOVER website for uploading documentation in support of a billing dispute is OBSOLETE due to outdated technology and DISCOVER 's unwillingness to update it and make its customers ' lives easier.

I've been a DISCOVER customer for over 20 years and always, paid my monthly balance in full. I will never forget the ingratitude, cheap corporate games and lack of customer support of this credit card and I will not cease to fight until I receive the justice due to me.",,"CAPITAL ONE, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION - GREENWOOD DELAWARE BRANCH",PA,19083,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10051702

2. Proof that NCS has a legitimate right to collect this alleged debt.

3. A complete account history that includes a breakdown of the amount owed, including how the balance was calculated.

Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1642 ( a ), any attempt to collect a debt without proper documentation is a violation of the FDCPA. NCS has yet to provide this proof, despite my previous attempts to resolve this matter. 

Grounds for Removal : Since NCS has not yet provided the required documents proving legal ownership or assignment of this alleged debt, I am requesting that this collection be removed from my credit report under the following case law : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : In this case, the court found that debt collectors must provide documentation that proves they have the right to collect a debt.

The email was sent out to me by Chase on XX/XX/XXXX shortly before XXXX XXXX, but my statement was supposedly made available to me on XX/XX/XXXX, I download my statements and examine them to make sure that they are accurate and complete - and I have found errors in statements in the past, despite what Chase would have you believe. 

I tried to do just that, download my statement, and I wasn't able to get onto the bank 's website because the bespoke, 2-factor authentication system they have built for themselves did not work properly. So, I called the only number made available to me by the website, which is not the number I am told to call about my credit card. 

I pay Chase money every year, which supposedly qualifies me for additional benefits ( none of which I seem to ever actually qualify for, and most of which have been taken away over time ). I have one of Chase 's Sapphire Preferred cards. 

I ended up spending over 15 minutes on the phone, talking to two women who work for, Chase, who were completely unable to tell me what had happened. The woman who is supposedly the "" tech '' support person working for the company, who was obviously an XXXXXXXX XXXX, was horrendous to work with. She was dismissive and rude, and refused to enter a trouble ticket, despite my telling her that I want to know what happened in the system validation process that caused me to not be able to get to my account quickly, and to have to interact with her in the first place. 

As I noted above, I pay Chase for the use of this card, and Chase also takes the highest fees allowed by VISA to process transactions I make using the card. I think Chase owes me some explanation other than "" it's a system, and glitches happen. '' We live in an era of ever mounting ways to be stolen from online, and I want to know what Chase has operating behind the scenes when I log onto their website to complete my banking with the company. I am fed up with banks and shopping sites losing my personally identifiable information, and their employees acting as if it's just not a problem. 

IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I want my government to start to hold banks like Chase to account for these kinds of issues. I want to know what happened today when I tried to get into my account online- an account I use for Chase 's benefit, not mine in reality - and I want a better explanation than "" it's a system, sometimes glitches happen. '' Glitches only happen when some system doesn't perform properly, and I should know what the problem was today, at least sufficient for me to understand what system failed to share what information that was needed. 

I want good security on my bank accounts, but I do not want that security to impair my ability to get into those accounts when I want to get into them ; and when such impairment occurs, I expect Chase 's people with whom I have to interact to understand that their airy-fairy explanations do not meet appropriate standards for this customer.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,MD,21213,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10051830
