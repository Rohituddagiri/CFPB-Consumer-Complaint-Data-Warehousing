2024-11-30,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with rewards from credit card,"My significant other and I have been planning a trip to XXXX XXXX and XXXX for a few months. On XX/XX/year> Chase Bank offered a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Points ( see attached ). XXXX XXXX XXXX travel with XXXX XXXX and they have a published redemption chart with the reward points needed for travel on XXXX XXXX to get from XXXX to XXXX XXXX or XXXX, XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX points are needed for a round trip first class ticket ( see attached ). 

I attempted to search for seats and an error came up saying no seats were found. Then I called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year> to see if they could find flights. They asked for my XXXX XXXX account and told me they could not look until the points were in my account. 

On XX/XX/year> XXXX points from my Chase Rewards account were transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account for a total of XXXX points ( more than enough points to cover XXXX first class cabin seats on XXXX per XXXX 's redemption chart ). Once they were in the account, the customer service agent told me that no flights on XXXX available as requested. 

I asked about refunding the points, and this was not possible. Called Chase, and found that this was not possible ( as they state all transfers are final ). 

I then read the "" small print '' on XXXX XXXX redemption site stating that redemption of XXXX XXXX XXXX points are not available on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ( see attached ). The other planes in their fleet ( where points can be used ), the XXXX, XXXX and XXXX do not have a first class accommodation ( see attached ). 

I have enough XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX points to book XXXX first class seats on XXXX XXXX from XXXX ( XXXX  ) to XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) but this flight will never be offered because XXXX XXXX only flies XXXX, XXXX and XXXX aircraft on this route. These aircraft are excluded from the XXXX XXXX redemption via the "" small print '', and first class accommodations do not exist on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 

It is unreasonable for XXXX XXXX to expect the general consumer to know that first class seating does not exist on the flights you can book on XXXX XXXX via their flying club. Therefore they devalued the points significantly because the only way to redeem points with XXXX XXXX is to take multiple connections with multiple airlines, and you can not ever get thefirst class seat theyhave advertised. 

They falsely advertise what appears to be an amazing award ( First Class round trip with XXXX XXXX for only XXXX points ) because they exclude planes that have first class, and first class does not exist on the remaining aircraft in XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

If I would have transferred my points XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), I could have booked round trip direct business class accommodations for me and my significant other XXXX points each. I was persuaded by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX transfer offer to then get a first class seat ( not business class ) for only XXXX points roundtrip. My points are now stuck and devalued in the XXXX XXXX XXXX club. 

This is blatant fraud. Essentially the same as saying "" XXXX points to travel to the moon, but all spacecraft are excluded from this redemption. '' A great offer that is impossible to book because you can't take a passenger jet to the moon. 

You can not advertise something that does not exist, and then entice customers with XXXX points transfersvia a permanent transferof points.

The payment amount made covered the Standard Purchases of {$160.00}, paid in full. The remainder of the payment of {$200.00} was to be applied to the Balance Transfer amount of {$2400.00} which incurs no interest payment through XX/XX/XXXX. The balance transfer amount after this payment was applied is {$2200.00}. 

Regarding the XXXX statement dated XXXX an erroneous interest charge was applied to my account for {$2.00}. A payment of {$260.00} was submitted thru XXXX bill pay service on XX/XX/XXXX, which was before the due date of XX/XX/XXXX. The payment amount made covered the Standard Purchases of {$60.00}, paid in full. The remainder of the payment was to be applied to the remaining Balance Transfer amount which should have resulted in {$2200.00} - {$200.00} = {$2000.00}, incurring no interest. 

Regarding the XXXX statement dated XXXX an erroneous interest charge has been applied to my account for {$2.00}. 
My Balance Transfer amount erroneously shows a total of {$2100.00}, whereas per Paragraph 2, my correct Balance Transer amount is {$2000.00}, incurring no interest. 
The statement indicates a Standard Purchases amount of {$210.00} which I intend to pay before the due date, along with a {$200.00} amount to be applied to the balance transer amount which incurs no interest. This payment is due XX/XX/XXXX. 

During my initial phone contact with Citi customer service, the agent saw the discrepancies & attributed it to a "" System Glitch ''. She said within the XXXX statement an erroneous {$95.00} balance subject to an interest rate of 20.74 % had been made and offered to refund the {$1.00} interest charge & that a correction within the system would be applied. However the subsequent 2 statements have not applied the correction to the interest charges made & to the erroneous balances appearing on my Balance Transfer remaining amount owed. 

The initial balance transfer fee of {$90.00} was paid in XXXX, XXXX well before the due date of XX/XX/XXXX.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Reporting and Request for 1099-C Documentation To Whom It May Concern, I am disputing the accuracy of an account listed on my credit report under 15 USC 1681s-2 , which mandates the reporting of accurate and verifiable information.

The account in question is as follows : 1. Account Name : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Listed : XXXX. XXXX, XXXX  The balance currently being reported is inaccurate and potentially unlawful. Per Gugger v. USAA Federal Bank, the issuance of a 1099-C form by a creditor indicates the occurrence of an identifiable event of debt cancellation. Under IRS regulations, Event Code 7 defines such an event as a discharge of indebtedness due to the creditors policy decision to cease collection activity and cancel the debt. 

If a 1099-C form has been issued for this account, the debt has been canceled, and reporting a balance is inaccurate and misleading. I am requesting the following : Verification of the Account Balance : Provide evidence demonstrating that the balance is accurate and collectible. 

Provision of the 1099-C Form : If issued, provide a copy to verify the identifiable event.

Immediate Deletion of the Account : If the debt was discharged under Event Code 7 or can not be verified, you are required to delete this negative information under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

Attached, you will find [ list of supporting documents ]. Please investigate this matter within the legally required 30-day timeframe. Failure to respond appropriately will result in further action.

Specifically : 1. I have disputed several accounts, requesting verification of their accuracy and validity.

2. The creditor companies associated with these accounts have failed to comply with their own policies and the legal requirements to provide verification in a timely manner.

3. Experian has not taken appropriate action to remove these unverified accounts from my credit report despite clear evidence of non-compliance by the creditors.

These unresolved issues have caused harm to my creditworthiness and financial standing. I provided Experian with all the necessary details and supporting documentation, including certified dispute letters and proof of delivery, but I have not received adequate resolution.

Account Number : XXXX ( duplicate or subsequent account ) with a reported balance of {$770.00}.

XXXX. Verify whether XXXX XXXX properly discharged the debts and issued the required documentation to the IRS. 
XXXX. If XXXX XXXX can not provide the requested documentation, require them to remove any negative or inaccurate reporting related to these accounts from my credit report immediately.

XXXX Account XXXX : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX ( Late Pay ) XXXX. XXXX Account XXXX : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX ( Late Pay ) These late payment notations are inaccurate and violate multiple provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), and relevant regulations. I am requesting an immediate investigation and the removal of these incorrect entries to ensure compliance with federal law. 

Violations of Federal Law 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( xi ) : Credit reporting agencies and furnishers must ensure that all information included in a consumers credit file is accurate and verifiable. Reporting unverifiable or inaccurate late payments breaches this standard.

15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 : Furnishers of information are legally required to report accurate data and promptly correct errors when notified.

2. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1666 ( b ) : Billing errors, including misreported late payments, must be thoroughly investigated and resolved by creditors. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes a direct violation of federal law.

3. Regulations Implementing TILA : 12 CFR 1026.13 : This regulation outlines the obligations of creditors to investigate and resolve billing disputes, including errors in reporting late payments. Noncompliance with this regulation is subject to penalties.

Damages and Remedies If these inaccuracies are not corrected promptly, I reserve the right to seek remedies under the following provisions : Statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation under FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 1681o ).

Actual damages resulting from the inaccuracies, including higher interest rates, credit denials, and emotional distress.

Punitive damages for willful noncompliance.

Recovery of legal fees and associated costs related to pursuing this matter.

Action Requested I am requesting that : 1. A comprehensive investigation be conducted for the accounts listed above in compliance with FCRA and TILA.

2. All inaccurate late payment entries be promptly removed from my credit report.

3. A written confirmation of the resolution be sent to me within 30 days, as required by 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

Next Steps I trust that your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and resolve it promptly. If this issue is not corrected, I will be compelled to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and other relevant regulatory agencies.

I am writing in response to your letter dated XX/XX/year>, regarding my complaint filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). Your response, which included a signed agreement and a payment statement, does not fulfill my explicit request for critical information. 

On XX/XX/year>, I sent you a letter requesting specific account details, which remain unaddressed in your response. For clarity, I will reiterate my request : 1. The date of first delinquency for the account.

2. The date of the last payment made on the account.

3. The date of the charge-off.

This information is essential to validate the accuracy of the information reported on my consumer report. As you are aware, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ), the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 ), and Title 18 of the United States Code, you are legally obligated to provide verifiable documentation that substantiates the accuracy of the information being furnished. Failure to provide such documentation constitutes a violation of my consumer rights.

Furthermore, your continued failure to provide the requested information may also implicate Title 18 U.S.C. 1028A, Aggravated Identity Theft, as the lack of validation for the account 's accuracy raises concerns about potential misuse of my personal information. 

I reiterate that a signed agreement does not justify or validate what is being reported on my credit file. Validation requires verifiable evidence confirming the specific dates and details requested. Your response has not fulfilled this legal standard, nor does it close this matter. 

If you fail to provide the requested information within 10 calendar days of your receipt of this correspondence, I will file a civil suit in good faith to seek damages for your violations of my consumer rights under the aforementioned laws.

I called them and requested a payment plan due to the hardship of my brother passing away and having to assist with funeral costs. I had to help other family members with funeral expenses as no one suspects death or an emergency of some sort, so in this case, I called to arrange my auto loan payment, and they recorded all the calls. So I did follow through with my set arrangements and the amounts I was told to pay made them aware of what I could pay and called when I needed to make further arrangements, and they said ( the customer service representative ) Bridge Crest got the payment late and stated due to my bank issuing time which I'm not accountable for it in some cases take the banks up to 3 days to release funds, and when Bridge Crest receive their payment it also take them 2-3 to collect but the Posted date is unchangeable and I have no control over this. I sent payment on the day asked and was told I wouldn't be under threat of a 30-day late payment credit reporting because the amount would help my interest as well as payment, a few days later, I got a notification a derogatory statement was reported on my credit report and unfortunately, it was BridgeCrest again they record their calls and they claimed that this matter happened because of timing then another time they stated because the car note was not paid in full which was lacking XXXX dollars. They made arrangements with me to ensure my complete coverage of the full car note for that billing cycle and no reporting to the credit bureaus, I feel that they violated my consumer rights under coding as the late payment coding15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) and15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), as well and I feel that wasn't a reason to report me and I was assured this per recorded calls I wouldn't be affected and I asked them to review the calls and this would assure confirmation. They ( the customer service team ) and the department that handles supervision complaints stated they would review but it was internal that it would be handled inside the company so basically if they found what I said to be true I wouldn't know. I hope that you find my complaint worthy of investigation. Also please assist with removing that derogatory late payment as that has depleted my score tremendously and is stopping me from trying to apply for home buyers to provide stability for my family and me a place to live, I feel they treated me unfairly as I am a loyal consistent paying customer. I have all documents supporting these facts along with copies of all the documents sent to all three bureaus and Creditors which have been uploaded.

**Details of the Issue : ** - The account in question ( Account Number : XXXX ) has been closed ; however, XXXX  XXXX XXXX continues to update the balance as though the account is active. This is inaccurate and constitutes false reporting under the FCRA. 
- This repeated inaccuracy has been reported to credit bureaus ( Experian, XXXX, and XXXX ) but remains unresolved. 

The FCRA requires that all information reported to credit bureaus be accurate, complete, and up to date. XXXX XXXX  failure to correct this issue is a clear violation of my rights under federal law. As a result, I am requesting immediate action by the CFPB to address this matter. 

**Resolution Requested : ** 1. I demand that this account be **immediately removed** from all three credit reports ( Experian, XXXX, and XXXX ) due to its inaccurate and misleading reporting. 
XXXX. I request that XXXX XXXX XXXX cease all further reporting of this account and any related balance updates. 

Failure to resolve this issue promptly will result in my pursuit of legal action, including seeking damages for each inaccuracy related to this account, as permitted under the FCRA. 

**Supporting Documentation : ** Enclosed are the following documents to support my complaint : - A copy of my recent credit report showing the inaccurate reporting. 
- Documentation confirming the accounts closed status. 

I trust the CFPB will take immediate and appropriate action to ensure compliance with federal regulations and protect my rights as a consumer. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and provide me with a timeline for your investigation and resolution. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am submitting this complaint because my credit report contains inaccurate and potentially unlawful entries, which violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The issues I am experiencing are outlined below : 1. Duplicate Reporting of the Same Debt Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), creditors and collection agencies are prohibited from furnishing inaccurate or misleading information to credit bureaus. My credit report shows the same debt reported multiple times by different entities : Original Lender : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX Investments Both accounts reflect the same original balance of {$990.00}, the same current balance of {$990.00}, and the same date assigned ( XX/XX/year> ). This duplicative reporting is misleading, unfairly impacts my credit score, and violates the FCRA requirement for accuracy in credit reporting. 

2. Incomplete or Missing Information Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information. However, XXXX of the entries is missing key details ( e.g., the "" Agency Name '' is blank for XXXX account ). This lack of information prevents me from understanding who owns the debt and whether it is being reported correctly. 

3. Failure to Update Information Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ), furnishers are required to update information to ensure accuracy. If this debt has been sold or reassigned, the original creditor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) should no longer report it. However, both entities are reporting the debt, suggesting the information is not being updated. 

4. Misrepresentation of Debt Responsibility If the debt has been transferred or sold to a collection agency, it is misleading for both the original creditor and the new collection agency to report the debt simultaneously. This violates the FCRA, as it creates confusion regarding the debt 's true ownership and status.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,MI,48197,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978857

I demand an immediate investigation and correction of these inaccuracies to ensure compliance with federal law. 

Violations of Federal Law 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of any disputed information within 30 days. Failure to do so is a violation of federal law.

15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) : Mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. The reporting of these inaccurate charge-offs violates this provision. 



2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1692g : Debt collectors must validate any debt upon request. If a charge-off can not be validated, it is unlawful for the creditor or debt collector to continue reporting the account.

3. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1635 : Creditors must provide accurate and fair disclosures related to the terms and validity of debts. Reporting charge-offs without proper documentation may constitute a violation of this statute.

Damages and Remedies If these inaccuracies are not corrected promptly, I reserve the right to pursue legal remedies under the FCRA and FDCPA, including : Statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation. 

Actual damages caused by these inaccuracies, such as increased interest rates, credit denials, or emotional distress. 

Punitive damages for willful noncompliance with federal statutes. 

Recovery of legal fees and associated costs. 


Action Requested I demand the following actions : 1. Conduct a thorough investigation of these accounts to verify their accuracy.

2. Remove the inaccurate charge-off entries from my credit report immediately.

3. Provide a written statement confirming the removal or correction of these entries within 30 days, as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). 



Next Steps Failure to comply with these demands will leave me no choice but to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and other relevant regulatory bodies. Additionally, I will consult legal counsel to pursue remedies under federal law for the harm caused by these inaccuracies.

This failure raises significant concerns about the accuracy of the information being reported to credit bureaus. 

Account Details : Creditor Name : XXXX Account Balance : {$180.00} Account Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX Continued Reporting : Monthly reporting through XX/XX/XXXX, and still ongoing today. 

I have contacted XXXX requesting a copy of the XXXX form to verify their reporting of this debt as canceled or discharged. However, they have failed to provide the requested documentation or any evidence supporting the continued reporting of this account. 

Moreover, this account has been reported monthly as an active account even after its alleged charge-off date, which further raises concerns about its accuracy. Such reporting XXXX be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as it misrepresents the status of the debt. 

Actions Requested : XXXX. Investigate XXXX failure to provide the requested XXXX form for the account listed above. 
XXXX. Verify whether XXXX properly discharged the debt and issued the required documentation to the IRS. 
XXXX. If XXXX can not provide proper documentation, require them to immediately remove any inaccurate or negative reporting related to this account from my credit report. 
XXXX. Address the issue of XXXX continued reporting of this account as active or delinquent despite the alleged charge-off.

I respectfully request that the CFPB intervene to ensure that XXXX complies with federal laws, including the FCRA, and that accurate reporting standards are maintained. Please let me know if additional information or documentation is required.

Please update my credit report accordingly and ensure the removal of the account within 30 days of receipt of this letter. If this account is not deleted from your records within 30 days, I will consider all available legal remedies, including filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and pursuing legal action for violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

This request is based on the recent deletion of an account by XXXX, XXXX of the XXXX major credit reporting agencies. I recently disputed a charge-o for { Charge off amount goes here } from { Creditor Goes here/ or company account was sold too }, listed on my XXXX report, and following a thorough investigation, XXXX has completely removed this unverifiable debt from my report as of XX/XX/2024. 
According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), all consumer reporting agencies must ensure that information in consumer reports is accurate, fair, and verifiable. 
Since XXXX has removed this account after its verification process, I request that you do the same and remove this unverifiable account from my credit report. 
Supporting Consumer Laws : FCRA Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires that inaccurate or unverifiable information must be deleted from a consumer 's credit file. I am exercising my right to ensure that my credit report remains fair, accurate, and free of unverifiable information. Since XXXX has deemed this account unverifiable and removed it, you must take similar action. 
Additionally, under FCRA Section 623 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), information suppliers must report only complete and accurate information. With XXXX having deemed this information unverifiable, I urge you to align its records accordingly. 
Please provide confirmation of this removal within XXXX days of receipt of this request. If the account is not removed, I am prepared to pursue further actions, including filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seeking legal action under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), including Section 616 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n ), which allows consumers to seek legal recourse for willful non- compliance, and Section 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681o ) for negligent non-compliance. 
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter, as it directly impacts my credit report 's integrity. Please notify me in writing once this deletion has been processed. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this request.

Background : I am a victim of identity theft and the XXXX data breach. My credit report contains unauthorized accounts that negatively impact my ability to obtain credit. 
Violations : The accounts and inquiries violate the following : -15 U.S.C. 1692e : False/Misleading Representations -15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Failure to Ensure Accuracy -15 U.S.C. 1681i : Failure to Investigate Disputes -15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) : Reporting Obsolete Information Accounts for Removal : Experian, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,CA,90230,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10979554

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, IA XXXX Subject : Immediate Removal of Unauthorized Accounts, Names, and Addresses ; Violation of FCRA and Federal Laws To Whom It May Concern, The credit reporting agencies continued refusal to block unauthorized information, despite my clear FTC identity theft report and the Certified UCC Search, constitutes a gross violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), and Identity Theft Protections under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2. Under this law, these agencies are legally bound to block fraudulent or disputed information within four business days, and their failure to do so is not only unlawful but also a willful violation of federal mandates. The idea that the credit reporting agencies would attempt to deny this requeston the grounds of previous disputes or any other rationaleignores the reality that I have never authorized the reporting of these items. This misrepresentation of my creditworthiness has severely impacted my financial opportunities, and their continued inaction constitutes an unacceptable breach of duty. 

In the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), the court emphasized that consumer reporting agencies must immediately correct and block unauthorized information upon notification by the consumer, particularly when fraud or identity theft is involved. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ), reaffirms that permissible purposethe basis for reporting informationcannot be assumed but must be explicitly consented to by the consumer. The refusal of these agencies to act in accordance with this precedent is, therefore, not just an error but fraudulent intent designed to perpetuate harm. 

Moreover, 18 U.S.C. 1028A imposes criminal penalties for identity theft, and 18 U.S.C. 894 criminalizes the use of extortionate means to collect or report credit data, which includes the misuse of consumer information for unverified debt reporting. These statutes serve as a deterrent to any effort to deny or delay the removal of fraudulent accounts. If these violations persist, I will immediately escalate this matter, seeking not only civil remedies but also criminal penalties for the companies and reporting agencies involved. Failure to comply with the FTC mandates, FCRA regulations, and the consumer rights afforded under the GLBA exposes these agencies to severe legal consequences. 

There is no legal basis for these agencies to deny my request, and any attempt to do so is a direct violation of my constitutional rights to privacy and to be free from unlawful defamation. The burden of proof is on them to demonstrate that the reported items are valid and that they have received my explicit consent to report these items. As I have already opted out and provided the FTC identity theft report, their failure to block this information constitutes illegal and fraudulent reporting. 



The continued reporting of unauthorized information, despite the irrefutable evidence provided by the UCC search, is not only a direct violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), and Identity Theft Protections but also constitutes a deliberate misrepresentation of my financial standing. This fraudulent reporting is not a mere clerical error ; it is a willful disregard of federal laws that are designed to protect consumers from the very harm I am suffering. The credit reporting agencies actionsor lack thereofare actively undermining my ability to access credit, impacting my financial stability and reputation. Their refusal to comply with clear legal mandates, including the four-day block rule under the FCRA, is an egregious violation that exposes me to irreparable harm. It is both an invasion of my privacy and an abuse of power for which they must be held accountable. Should this matter not be resolved immediately, the consequences will not be limited to the removal of these accounts but will include the pursuit of legal action, financial penalties, and potentially criminal charges under 18 U.S.C. 1028A for identity theft and extortionate collection practices under 18 U.S.C. 894. The willful negligence by the credit bureaus in upholding their obligations is unacceptable, and I demand swift, decisive action to remove all fraudulent accounts, unauthorized information, and misrepresented data from my credit report without delay.

This formal complaint is submitted in response to the ongoing violation of my consumer rights by XXXX, XXXX, and Experian. Despite filing an FTC Identity Theft Report, providing a Certified Georgia UCC Search Report, and opting out of any further unauthorized reporting under federal law, the credit reporting agencies have failed to honor their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Their blatant disregard for the law and failure to block unauthorized accounts within the legally mandated four business days has led to severe damage to my financial reputation, and it must be addressed immediately. 

Unauthorized Accounts : The following accounts are being reported on my credit report without my written consent, authorization, or legal justification. These accounts must be removed immediately : XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : {$650.00} Violation : Unauthorized reporting, no validation provided, and no written consent for reporting. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Balance : {$670.00} Violation : No validation provided, unauthorized reporting, and XXXX violation for disclosing private medical information.

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Balance : Related to a previously removed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Violation : Unauthorized reporting, late payment reporting without written consent. 

Unauthorized Addresses : The following addresses are being reported without my consent and must be removed immediately : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX Unauthorized Names : The only name that should be reported on my credit report is XXXX XXXX XXXX. The following unauthorized names must be removed immediately : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Violation of Federal Law : 1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRA Section 604A Section 2 ) : Under this section of the FCRA, consumer reporting agencies may only furnish accounts with explicit written authorization. I have not provided written consent for any of these accounts to be reported on my credit report. This constitutes fraud, misrepresentation of my financial standing, and defamation of character. 
XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( Section 605B ) Failure to Block Fraudulent Information : Once I submitted the FTC Identity Theft Report, the credit reporting agencies were legally obligated to block all disputed and fraudulent information from my report within four business days. They have failed to do so, which is a gross violation of my rights under the FCRA. 
XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ) ( c ) ( Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) : The credit reporting agencies and financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing nonpublic personal information to a third party without my explicit written consent. Their failure to comply with my opt-out request is a direct violation of this law. 
XXXX. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( Accuracy of Reporting ) : XXXX, XXXX, and Experian are legally required to ensure the accuracy of the information reported. Their failure to block fraudulent accounts, names, and addresses from my credit report is a violation of this obligation. 

Legal Precedents and Supporting Case Law : XXXX. XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : The FCRA mandates that consumer consent be obtained before reporting any information. Unauthorized use of credit information without consumer consent is a violation of federal law. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : The failure to remove unauthorized information constitutes a violation of the FCRA. 
XXXX. FTC XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : The FTC has the authority to enforce actions against entities that engage in unfair or deceptive practices, including unauthorized reporting of consumer information. 

Severe Consequences for Noncompliance : If these unauthorized accounts, addresses, and names are not removed from my credit report within four business days, the following legal actions will be taken : 1. FTC Complaint : I will file a formal complaint with the FTC for violating federal law regarding unauthorized and inaccurate reporting.

2. Lawsuit for Violations of FCRA, GLBA, and Other Applicable Laws : Willful noncompliance will result in statutory damages, including fines of up to {$1000.00} per violation under FCRA 1681n, along with possible punitive damages for fraud.

3. Filing an Arbitration Claim : I will pursue arbitration for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of my legal rights, including claims for damages related to defamation, emotional distress, and financial harm caused by these fraudulent entries. 
4. Court Fees and Arbitration Fees : In addition to the penalties above, the companies and credit reporting agencies may face court and arbitration fees totaling {$500.00} to {$3000.00} per claim. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue these claims in full to ensure my rights are upheld and that proper compensation is provided. 

Resolution Request : I demand the following actions be taken immediately : 1. Immediate Removal of All Unauthorized Accounts, Addresses, and Names from my credit report, as mandated by federal law. 
2. Written Confirmation from each credit bureau acknowledging the unauthorized nature of these accounts and confirming their permanent removal.

3. Verification of Compliance : Each credit bureau must implement improvements to ensure that unauthorized reporting does not occur in the future. 

Conclusion : As a victim of fraudulent and unauthorized reporting, I am entitled to immediate removal of these inaccuracies from my credit report. The credit reporting agencies have ignored their legal obligations, misrepresented my creditworthiness, and caused significant harm to my financial reputation. I expect full compliance with these demands and a resolution within four ( 4 ) business days. If not, I will pursue all legal remedies, including escalating this matter to regulatory authorities.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,31015,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10973130

Because the thieves had access to my phone, I had to visit my phone provider to purchase a new phone and SIM card to retain my phone number. 



As a college student, I can not afford to lose access to these critical funds. I would greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide in resolving this issue as soon as possible.

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX stating they was done with my online dispute. For some reason they return by stating this here Account information disputed by consumer ( FCRA ) ; XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. Now who are you taking about is my grantor over my account when did the consumer agencies become bankers or creditors? I notice that even Experian 's has come back with this same statement. 
I should not have to tell you at that transactions and experiences are excluded from consumer reports. I have, however, since XX/XX/XXXX, been telling you to STOP reporting my transactions and experiences. You can not pick and choose which section of the Fair Credit Reporting Act you want to follow and which section you do not. 
Pursuant to section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you making a report containing my transactions and experiences is a prohibited. I suspect XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and Experian are in collusion with committing securities fraud XXXX money laundering, tax evasion, and extortion. Transaction 1. Any event that causes a change in an organizations financial position or net worth, resulting from normal business activity. It is recorded on the general ledger by debit or credit tickets. 2. Advance of funds, as in a credit card cash advance, purchase of goods at a retailer, or when a borrower activates a line of credit. 3. Activities affecting a deposit account, such as a deposit of funds or a withdrawal, carried out at the request of the account holder. Every time I use my credit card to make a purchase, that purchase is recorded in the general ledger according to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Every purchase I make is a transaction. Every purchase I make using my credit card raises my debt utilization. Debt utilization is the result of one or more a transaction. My credit card balances are based on the purchase of goods at a retailer. Purchases money or the advance of funds held on deposit is a transaction. My credit limit is a transaction. Activities such as a deposit or withdrawal reflect my payment history. My payment history is a transaction. Every transaction is a bank experience. My debt utilization, account balances, amounts due, due dates, and payment history are all transactions and experiences that must be excluded from my consumer report. IMMEDIATELY STOP REPORTING MY DEBT UTILIZATION, ACCOUNT BALANCES, AMOUNTS DUE, DUE DATES, ALL PAYMENTS HISTORY, AND UPDATE REFERENCED IN THIS COMPLAINT TO PAID AS AGREED. These transactions are a result of income being credited and debited from my accounts. Debt is a reflection of my income. Furthermore, I've notified you over three times about the billing dispute I've been having with the referenced in this complaint since XX/XX/XXXX. After I notified you, and dispute you continued to make reports and allow reports to be made containing prohibited information. Pursuant to section 162 ( a ) of the Fair Credit Billing Act, adverse credit reporting during a billing dispute is prohibited. So even if you were permitted to make reports using my transactions and experiences, adverse reports made during a billing dispute, to any party, is prohibited. I personally gave you notice of the billing dispute and through the CFPB complaint site I've been having with the referenced in this complaint and you still continue to create reports using the inaccurate and prohibited information given to you by the referenced in this complaint. You are also currently making reports showing my accounts which is closed. Not only is that a violation of section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) of the Fair Credit Reporting act and section 162 ( a ) of The Fair Credit Billing Act, pursuant to section 161 ( d ) of The Fair Credit Billing Act, restricting or closing my account because of a billing error is also prohibited. This account was closed unlawfully, and you XXXX XXXX, Experian are allowing the furnishing and reporting of an unlawful action taken against me. I told you to remove these accounts that are referenced in this complaint until the disputes are resolved and accurate credit reporting has been established. Due to the reports your making containing this unlawful, prohibited, and inaccurate information, my name and credit has been made inequitable. My credit scores and credit ratings have dropped tremendously. This is a misrepresentation of my identity, and your misrepresentation of my identity can be considered as identity theft. I suspect you did not do a proper investigation or reinvestigation before you allowed that information furnished and reported. Even after I specified what information was inaccurate and illegal you still allowed the illegal / inaccurate information to be furnished and reported. Even after I informed you by mail and CFPB COMPLAINT of the billing dispute, you still allowed adverse credit reporting. Even after I pointed out to you exactly what information is prohibited from being furnished and reported on a consumer report, you still permitted the furnishing and reporting of said prohibited information on my consumer report. I have been sending the referenced in this complaint checks and it is has not processed any of them. I have been sending referenced in this complaint checks and it has refused them all.

The accounts in question are : Account # XXXX : {$8500.00} ( closed XX/XX/XXXX ), {$2000.00} ( closed XX/XX/XXXX ), {$860.00} ( closed XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Account # XXXX : {$36000.00} ( closed XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Account # XXXX : {$24000.00} ( closed XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Account # XXXX : {$2000.00}, {$8500.00}, {$36000.00} ( all closed XX/XX/XXXX ). 
The inaccurate reporting impacts my credit score and does not reflect the accurate history of these accounts. I have contacted the credit bureaus, but they updated only the remarks with a "" dispute resolved - consumer disagrees '' status instead of making the necessary corrections. 

I am requesting that the CFPB facilitate an investigation to ensure the accounts are accurately reported as paid through the TPD discharge program and reflect their prior deferment status.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30038,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10981030

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding the reporting of collection accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me and have not been properly validated as required under federal law. The failure to validate these debts and the continued reporting of unverifiable accounts violates provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

These accounts, listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have caused harm to my credit profile and reputation. Below, I outline the applicable legal obligations and my specific grievances : Validation of Debt Is Required Under the FCRA and FDCPA : Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( FDCPA ), a debt collector must, upon written request within 30 days of the initial communication, provide validation of the debt. Validation must include : 1.Proof that the debt exists.

2.Documentation that I am the rightful debtor, such as signed agreements or contracts.

3.An itemized breakdown of the debt amount.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( FCRA ), entities furnishing information to credit reporting agencies must ensure that the data is accurate and verifiable. This includes confirming the legitimacy of debts reported. To date, these accounts have not been validated with proper documentation, yet they remain on my credit report, which is a clear violation of these legal obligations. 

Requirements for Credit Reporting Accuracy : Section 623 of the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) mandates that information furnished to credit reporting agencies must be accurate and verifiable. Further, under Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), consumers have the right to dispute inaccuracies, and credit reporting agencies must investigate and resolve disputes within 30 days.

These disputed accounts remain on my credit report despite my requests for validation. The continued reporting of unverified debts constitutes willful noncompliance with federal law. Additionally : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure maximum possible accuracy of information reported.

If these debts can not be substantiated, they must be removed immediately, as mandated by Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ).

Lack of Appropriate Documentation : To date, the debt collectors and credit reporting agencies have failed to provide the following critical documentation to validate the debts : Proof of my liability, such as a signed contract or agreement with the original creditor. 
Chain of title documentation establishing that the debt was legally assigned to the debt collector. 
An itemized statement breaking down the total debt amount, including interest, fees, and charges. 

Without such documentation, these debts are unverifiable, and their continued reporting violates my rights under federal law.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NY,10027,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10973127

I previously filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) regarding unauthorized inquiries on my credit report. The reference number for that complaint is FTC Complaint Number XXXX, filed on FTC Complaint Date XX/XX/XXXX. 
Complaint Description : My credit report contains unauthorized inquiries that were made without my consent. Upon contacting the creditors responsible for these inquiries, they confirmed they have no evidence that I initiated these inquiries and lack any written or verbal authorization from me. 
Due to the lack of valid grounds for these inquiries, I formally requested their immediate removal. The credit bureau in question has not provided a satisfactory response, which is why I filed a complaint with the FTC. 

Details of Disputed Inquiries : 1. XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX 2. XXXX XXXX XXXX  - XX/XX/XXXX 3. XXXX XXXX  - XX/XX/XXXX 4. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX 5. XXXX XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX 6.

XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX Legal Grounds ( Fair Credit Reporting Act, FCRA ) : Permissible Purposes : Under Section 604, unauthorized inquiries do not meet the requirements for permissible purposes. 
Handling of Unverifiable Information : According to Section 611, any inquiry that can not be verified must be removed.

Right of Verification : Section 609 grants me the right to verify each inquiry with an original signed contract. 
Information Provider Responsibility : Section 623 requires that reported data is accurate and authorized.

Protection Against Identity Theft : Section 605A mandates the removal of unauthorized inquiries potentially related to identity theft. 
"" I am attaching the report of the formal complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) as additional support for this claim. This report reinforces my request for the removal of unauthorized inquiries from my credit report, as it details the lack of authorization for these inquiries and the inadequate response from the credit bureau involved. '' Additional Legal Support : Cases such as Hartz v. Pacific Creditors Association ( XXXX  ) and Dennis v. BEH-1, LLC ( XXXX  ) reinforce that inquiries must meet the FCRA 's permissible purposes requirements. 
Formal Request : I am formally requesting a thorough and manual investigation of the disputed inquiries and their removal if there is no verifiable documentation. I reserve the right to take legal action and file an additional complaint with the CFPB and my state 's Attorney General.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Dear CFPB, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request an investigation into the procedures employed by the major credit reporting agenciesXXXX, XXXX, and Experianregarding the accuracy of information reported on my credit file. I am concerned about certain inaccuracies that I have identified and the subsequent failure of these agencies to provide adequate responses and documentation, which I believe constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Background Recently, I submitted complaints to XXXX, XXXX, and Experian regarding incorrect information reported on my credit reports. Despite my efforts to address these inaccuracies, I have not received satisfactory responses or valid proof of the claims made by these agencies. Most importantly, I have repeatedly requested to review the "" Procedures of Accuracy '' that these agencies claim to use to verify the information in my reports. Thus far, I have not received any meaningful information or documentation in response to my requests. 

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) The FCRA outlines specific responsibilities for credit reporting agencies, including the requirement to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Below are specific violations of the FCRA that I believe warrant your investigation : 1. Section 607 ( b ) - Reasonable Procedures : Credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. I have doubts that XXXX, XXXX, and Experian have adhered to this requirement in my case, as the inaccuracies I reported have not been corrected nor explained. 

2. Section 611 - Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy : Upon receiving my dispute, these agencies are mandated to conduct a reasonable investigation of my claims within 30 days. I submitted my dispute to all three agencies, but they have failed to provide the required investigation results or documentation supporting the accuracy of the reported information. Their lack of response is a clear violation of this section. 

3. Failure to Validate Debts : When I identified the inaccuracies, I requested that the agencies provide validation of the debts and the procedures they used to verify the informations accuracy. Under the FCRA, they are obligated to provide this information and their failure to do so represents another violation of my consumer rights.

4. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - Duty of Furnishers of Information : Any entity that provides information to consumer reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy of that information. If the information provided is found to be inaccurate, the furnishers have a duty to correct it. I am concerned that the agencies are not holding these furnishers accountable for the inaccurate reporting. 

5. Lack of Adequate Consumer Responses : The agencies have not provided timely or useful responses to my inquiries, which I believe underlines a broader failure to protect consumer rights as mandated by the FCRA. 

Request for Action Given the collective issues I have faced, I respectfully ask the CFPB to conduct a thorough investigation into the practices of XXXX, XXXX, and Experian regarding how they handle inaccuracies and disputes. Furthermore, I urge your office to compel these agencies to provide their "" Procedures of Accuracy '' and ensure they are compliant with the FCRA requirements.

As a consumer, I have the right to accurate credit reporting, and the current situation jeopardizes my financial health and fundamental rights. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response. 
I am writing to formally submit a complaint against XXXX, XXXX, and Experian for multiple violations of federal laws governing credit reporting and consumer privacy. Specifically, I believe these credit reporting agencies have violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( i ) and 1681i, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), 15 U.S.C. 6801-6805, the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), 15 U.S.C. 1666b, and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.

1. Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate and complete information in consumer reports. Section 15 U.S.C. 1681i places a requirement on these agencies to conduct a reasonable investigation when a dispute is raised by a consumer. Despite my numerous attempts to dispute inaccurate information on my credit reports, I have received no effective responses or resolutions. The inaccurate entries include : - [ Specify inaccuracies e.g., incorrect account balances, erroneous public records, etc. ] - [ Provide details on unauthorized inquiries dated, as applicable ] These inaccuracies jeopardize the integrity of my credit report and have impacted my creditworthiness adversely.

2. Violations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) : The GLBA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 6801-6805, mandates that financial institutions protect consumer privacy. I have discovered unauthorized inquiries on my credit report for which I did not provide consent. This represents a clear violation of my right to control access to my personal financial information.

3. Violations of the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) : I believe the actions of these credit bureaus also infringe upon my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1666b, as they have failed to provide proper procedures for disputing billing errors. My written requests and disputes have gone unanswered, violating my rights under this act.

4. Violations of the Privacy Act of 1974 : Under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, I have the right to know what personal information is being collected about me and to whom it is being disclosed. I have been unsuccessful in obtaining this information, especially concerning unauthorized inquiries.

5. Section 1681a ( 2 ) ( I ) : Section 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( 2 ) ( I ) concerns the transactions and experiences commonly used in credit reports. The inaccuracies reported suggest a failure in this area, further undermining my trust in the credit reporting process.

I expect these agencies to adhere strictly to the provisions of the FCRA and other relevant laws, ensuring they provide accurate, complete, and timely information to consumers. I ask the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate these matters thoroughly and hold these credit bureaus accountable for their actions.

Thank you for your attention to this significant issue. I look forward to your prompt action in resolving my complaints and restoring the accuracy and integrity of my credit reports.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, DE XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX XXXX : Account Number : XXXX Original Creditor : Transworld Systems , Inc .

To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to dispute the continued reporting of the above-referenced account on my credit reports. This letter serves as a formal notice that I hereby revoke any and all consent given under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) for Transworld Systems, Inc. , to report my information to consumer reporting agencies.

Additionally, I am requesting verification of the payment history, the accuracy of the reporting, and the permissible purpose used by Transworld Systems , Inc. in relation to this account. Under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ), there must be a legally permissible reason to access or report information, and I request specific proof of such purpose.

Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention that according to IRS guidelines, canceled debt must be reported to the IRS on a Form 1099-C, which reflects the discharge of the debt. If this account has been canceled or discharged, it should not continue to be reported as delinquent or outstanding. Any continued reporting of a canceled debt is not only inaccurate but could be considered a violation of the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ), which mandates maximum possible accuracy. 

To support my position, courts have consistently ruled on the importance of accurate credit reporting. For instance, in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), the court ruled that reporting inaccurate information can form the basis of an FCRA claim when a creditor fails to correct or clarify disputed or misleading information. Moreover, in XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), the court held that credit reporting agencies must exercise reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of information reported to consumer credit files. 

Please provide the methods of verification under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) ) used to validate the information being reported. If Transworld Systems , Inc. or any credit reporting agency fails to provide proof of permissible purpose or accurate reporting, I will pursue legal remedies, including monetary damages under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) for any willful or negligent noncompliance. 

I request a prompt response within 30 days to resolve this matter. Please remove any inaccurate or unverifiable information from my credit report, as well as cease any further reporting if proof of permissible purpose or accuracy can not be provided.

2024-11-30,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I have two credit cards with Navy Federal Credit Union : a XXXX XXXX with a {$5000.00} limit and a XXXX XXXX XXXX  with a {$3000.00} limit, both of which have always been kept in good standing with on-time payments. On XX/XX/XXXX, a fraudulent charge of {$1600.00} was made to my XXXX XXXX from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX a company I have never rented from. I immediately contacted XXXX to resolve the issue but was unable to do so. I then disputed the charge with Navy Federal, but they refused to investigate, citing that the charge was past the 60-day window for investigation, leaving me responsible for the full amount. 

Shortly after, another fraudulent charge of {$1400.00} appeared on my XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX. I disputed this charge with Navy Federal and requested proof of my authorization, such as a signed rental agreement, a copy of my drivers license, and credit card details. Navy Federal was unable to provide any documentation showing that I had authorized the charge. After weeks of back-and-forth, Navy Federal offered to reduce my liability to {$340.00}, stating that I should be happy that I was not being held responsible for the entire amount. However, I maintained that this charge was fraudulent and unauthorized, and I refused to pay. 

Navy Federal continued to charge me interest on both fraudulent charges, imposed late fees due to my refusal to pay the unauthorized charges, and reported multiple late payments, incorrect balances, and over-limit charges to the credit bureaus. These actions have severely damaged my credit score. 

The documents attached to this claim will show that these charges were disputed as fraud. Navy Federal repeatedly referred to the charges as billing disputes instead of fraud, and they refused to investigate the {$1600.00} charge on my XXXX, leaving me with no documentation for that charge. Navy Federal sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX, stating that no billing error had occurred and I was responsible for {$1400.00}. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, they initially credited this amount back to my account when I first reported the fraud. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, they denied the dispute for the first time and charged the amount back to my account. I immediately contacted them and requested that the dispute be reopened. On XX/XX/XXXX, Navy Federal issued another credit for {$1400.00} and reopened the dispute. Yet, on XX/XX/XXXX, they charged my account {$340.00} and sent another letter stating no billing error had occurred. 

I called Navy Federal and spoke with their "" disputes manager '' who stated that the merchant had provided documentation and that I should be happy that I was only being held liable for {$340.00} instead of the entire {$1400.00}. However, I am confused and frustrated as to how I could be responsible for any of this fraud when I never authorized the charges, and how they determined that only {$1100.00} was fraudulent. 

Additionally, Navy Federal attached a clearly fraudulent and doctored rental agreement from XXXX as part of their justification for the charge. The rental agreement contains numerous inconsistencies and is evidently fabricated : The mileage on the rental car is listed as XXXX miles at the time of rental and XXXX miles at return. Its suspicious that the car drove exactly XXXX miles during the rental, which seems highly unlikely and suggests the agreement was altered. 
The optional services listed on the agreement include {$280.00} in charges for personal accident insurance, personal effects protection, and additional liability insurance. I own a XXXX XXXX with full coverage that includes rental insurance, so I would never have purchased these services. This suggests the agreement was falsified. 
The agreement includes a {$500.00} "" miscellaneous charge '', which is unexplained and violates the Truth in Lending Act and SCUTPA, as charges must be itemized. The lack of explanation for these charges points to further deception. 
Neither XXXX nor Navy Federal could provide a copy of my drivers license or any document with my signature for either of the unauthorized charges, despite my repeated requests for this information. 
I have consistently asked Navy Federal to provide a signed rental agreement with my signature matching the one on my drivers license, but they have been unable to do so. This proves the charges were unauthorized, and the documents involved are fraudulent",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,SC,29456,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10980723

This failure raises significant concerns about the accuracy of the information being reported to credit bureaus. 

The details of the accounts in question are as follows : Account XXXX : XXXX with a reported balance of {$760.00}. 
Account XXXX : XXXX with a reported balance of {$520.00}. 
Account XXXX : XXXX ( duplicate or subsequent account ) with a reported balance of {$770.00}. 

I have previously contacted Capital One requesting a copy of the XXXX form for each of these accounts to verify their reporting of these debts as canceled or discharged. Despite my request, Capital One has failed to provide the requested documentation or any evidence supporting their continued reporting of these accounts. 

Without proper documentation, the reporting of these accounts may be inaccurate and in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Their failure to validate these accounts creates confusion and potentially damages my credit profile unfairly. Actions Requested : 1. Investigate Capital Ones failure to provide the requested 1099-C forms for the accounts listed above. 2. Verify whether Capital One properly discharged the debts and issued the required documentation to the IRS.

3. If Capital One can not provide the requested documentation, require them to remove any negative or inaccurate reporting related to these accounts from my credit report immediately. 

I respectfully request the CFPB to intervene to ensure that Capital One complies with federal laws and provides accurate reporting. Please let me know if further documentation or clarification is required.

2024-11-30,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","XXXX XXXX, I received a check for around {$2200.00} because there was a surplus in my escrow. I called the lender after receiving the check to confirm my escrow was calculated correctly and asked when the last time the amount was checked. I know in Michigan, summer taxes are collected in XXXX, and mine were paid ( or should have been paid ) right before the check to me was cut. When my lender confirmed the amounts were accurate, I set the check aside and went on with my day. The check included a letter saying that my new monthly payment will be around {$750.00} due to the surplus. My monthly mortgage is set to auto payments, so I don't make a habit of confirming payments are sent ; I know the funds are there. XXXX payment for {$750.00} was auto paid as usual, but I checked my account on Tuesday of this week and learned that my account was almost overdrawn due to my mortgage payment. The payment had increased with no notice to me from {$750.00} to {$1200.00} in a month. Of course I called the lender to find out why and was told "" my taxes and insurance rates went down and then went back up ''. 
I work for this lender, I understand that within the XXXX year of a mortgage, taxes and insurance is not always calculated correctly, but I bought this house in 2017, there has been no insurance claims or tax adjustments. The person I spoke with could only tell me that my taxes went down, so I asked her to explain when the taxes would have dropped and to explain the insurance inaccuracies. 
My lender paid around {$45.00} for the year according to the information I was given over the phone, so I checked my account in our system, and that was right. It would seem as if my insurance wasn't paid correctly either, yet the vendor didn't force-place insurance. My escrow is included in my monthly payments to avoid me as the consumer making these types of mistakes. 
In the course of a month, I was told I had a surplus in my escrow and only to never be notified an error was made and that the check needed to be refunded. In the past XXXX months my mortgage has been : {$940.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$750.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$1200.00} XX/XX/XXXX The lender still has not sent a notice that there was a $ 400 monthly increase. I found all of this out a day before XXXX, and to correct the mistake they made, I have to come up with the escrow shortage of {$2100.00}, pay a {$1200.00} mortgage. The consumer does not calculate the escrow fees, the lender does, they pay an entire group of people to run escrow analysis, yet somehow they made a mistake on mine and neglected to inform me about it and when I call I'm told there is nothing they can do about it. 
So now, I have to struggle to pay my lender thousands right before XXXX for a mistake I did not make or would have had no knowledge of.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANCORP INC,MI,48223,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10979548

This failure raises significant concerns about the accuracy of the information being reported to credit bureaus. 

The details of the account in question are as follows : Account Number : XXXX Reported Balance : {$430.00} I have previously contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  requesting a copy of the 1099-C form for this account to verify their reporting of the debt as canceled or discharged. However, despite my request, they have failed to provide the requested documentation or any evidence supporting their continued reporting of this account.

Without proper documentation, the reporting of this account may be inaccurate and in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Their failure to validate this account creates confusion and potentially damages my credit profile unfairly.

Actions Requested : 1. Investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX  failure to provide the requested 1099-C form for the account listed above.

2. Verify whether XXXX XXXX Bank properly discharged the debt and issued the required documentation to the IRS.

3. If XXXX XXXX XXXX  can not provide the requested documentation, require them to remove any negative or inaccurate reporting related to this account from my credit report immediately. 

I respectfully request the CFPB to intervene to ensure that XXXX XXXX XXXX  complies with federal laws and provides accurate reporting. Please let me know if further documentation or clarification is required.

These inaccuracies violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which requires all information on my credit report to be accurate, complete, and verifiable. Therefore, I request the immediate deletion of this account from my credit file. 

Account Details in Question Creditor Name : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Reported Balance : {$50000.00} Current Balance : {$0.00} Status : Open, 120+ days late Last Payment Recorded : XX/XX/XXXX Disputed Points and Reasons for Deletion 1. Inaccurate Balance Reporting The account reflects a reported balance of {$50000.00} while simultaneously listing a current balance of {$0.00}. This contradiction creates confusion and misleads creditors, as it suggests an unresolved obligation when no balance is owed. 
Why It Needs Deletion : This inaccurate balance violates FCRA 1681c-2, which prohibits reporting of erroneous or conflicting data. If the current balance is indeed {$0.00}, then the {$50000.00} reported balance is inaccurate and must be removed. 
XXXX. Incomplete Payment History The payment history for this account is incomplete, with months marked as No Data. This failure to provide a full and accurate record of payments misrepresents my payment behavior and obligations. 
Why It Needs Deletion : Incomplete or unverifiable payment data violates FCRA 1681i, which requires the correction or removal of unverifiable or incomplete information. If the payment history can not be accurately verified, the account must be removed. 
XXXX. Unsupported Delinquency Status The account is listed as 120+ days late, yet it also reflects a {$0.00} current balance and no payment activity since XX/XX/XXXX. This delinquency status appears inaccurate or outdated and is unsupported by the provided data. 
Why It Needs Deletion : FCRA 1681e ( b ) requires all reported data to be accurate and verifiable. If TransUnion or the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  can not substantiate this delinquency status with evidence, it must be removed, or the entire account deleted. 
4. Violation of FCRA Verification Requirements As required under FCRA 1681i, all data reported to credit bureaus must be verified as accurate and complete. If the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  can not provide verifiable documentation supporting the balance, delinquency status, or payment history, this account must be deleted. 

Supporting Evidence To support my dispute, I have included the following documents : A copy of my drivers license and/or passport for identity verification. 
Payment records, if applicable, demonstrating the resolution of this account. 
[ Optional ] A copy of an FTC Identity Theft Report if this account is misreported due to fraud. 

Requested Action Based on the inaccuracies outlined above, I formally request the following : 1. Conduct a thorough investigation of this account as required by the FCRA. 
XXXX. If the information can not be verified or corrected, delete this account entirely from my credit report. 
XXXX. Provide a detailed summary of your findings, including verification or correction of each disputed point. 

Conclusion This dispute is submitted under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I expect the investigation to be completed within the legally mandated 30-day timeframe. If TransUnion can not verify the accuracy of the reported information within this period, the account must be removed in compliance with the FCRA. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If you require additional information, please contact me at XXXX or via email at XXXX.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am submitting this complaint because my credit report contains inaccurate and potentially unlawful entries, which violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The issues I am experiencing are outlined below : 1. Duplicate Reporting of the Same Debt Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), creditors and collection agencies are prohibited from furnishing inaccurate or misleading information to credit bureaus. My credit report shows the same debt reported multiple times by different entities : Original Lender : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Collection Agency : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Both accounts reflect the same original balance of {$990.00}, the same current balance of {$990.00}, and the same date assigned ( XX/XX/year> ). This duplicative reporting is misleading, unfairly impacts my credit score, and violates the FCRA requirement for accuracy in credit reporting. 

2. Incomplete or Missing Information Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information. However, one of the entries is missing key details ( e.g., the "" Agency Name '' is blank for one account ). This lack of information prevents me from understanding who owns the debt and whether it is being reported correctly.

3. Failure to Update Information Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ), furnishers are required to update information to ensure accuracy. If this debt has been sold or reassigned, the original creditor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) should no longer report it. However, both entities are reporting the debt, suggesting the information is not being updated. 

4. Misrepresentation of Debt Responsibility If the debt has been transferred or sold to a collection agency, it is misleading for both the original creditor and the new collection agency to report the debt simultaneously. This violates the FCRA, as it creates confusion regarding the debt 's true ownership and status.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",MI,48197,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10982867

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am filing a complaint regarding two accounts that remain on my credit report with XXXX and TransUnion : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account # XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX ( Account # XXXX ). 

I have previously disputed these debts and requested debt validation under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g. Both creditors, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, were required by law to provide me with proof of the debt, such as contracts or signed agreements. However, neither company provided any documentation supporting their claims, which violates the FDCPA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), particularly 15 U.S.C. 1681i. 

Despite the failure of both creditors to validate the debts, the accounts were reported as accurate on my credit reports. XXXX removed these accounts due to the lack of verification, but XXXX and TransUnion failed to update or remove the accounts, which I believe is a violation of FCRA 1681i, which mandates that a credit bureau must correct or remove inaccurate or unverifiable information.

Furthermore, the FDCPA 1692e prohibits the use of false or misleading representations in the collection of debts. The failure to provide validation and the continued reporting of these debts as accurate after being marked as closed remains a violation, as the accounts are inaccurately marked as resolved or paid when they have not been validated, and no documentation has been provided.

Under FCRA 1681e ( b ), even if accounts are reported as closed, they must still be reported accurately. A closed status does not eliminate the need for accuracy, and the information must be verified for authenticity, which was not done. Reporting a closed account without proper validation still constitutes a violation because it results in the reporting of unverifiable, potentially incorrect information on my credit report. 

I previously filed complaints with the CFPB, but the dispute process was not handled properly by the credit bureaus or creditors. Below are the reference numbers for my previous CFPB complaints : XXXX XXXX complaints : XXXX : ( XXXX ) TransUnion : ( XXXX ) World Finance Company complaints : XXXX : ( XXXX ) TransUnion : ( XXXX ) Despite these complaints and my requests for debt validation, XXXX and TransUnion have continued to report the accounts as closed but unverifiable. This is an ongoing violation of both the FCRA and FDCPA. 

I request that the CFPB take the following actions : XXXX. Investigate the failure of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX to properly validate the debts. 
XXXX. Ensure XXXX and TransUnion remove the unverifiable accounts from my credit report. 
XXXX. Require XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to comply with the FDCPA and FCRA by properly verifying the debts.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Dear CFPB, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request an investigation into the procedures employed by the major credit reporting agenciesTransUnion, XXXX, and Experianregarding the accuracy of information reported on my credit file. I am concerned about certain inaccuracies that I have identified and the subsequent failure of these agencies to provide adequate responses and documentation, which I believe constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Background Recently, I submitted complaints to TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX regarding incorrect information reported on my credit reports. Despite my efforts to address these inaccuracies, I have not received satisfactory responses or valid proof of the claims made by these agencies. Most importantly, I have repeatedly requested to review the "" Procedures of Accuracy '' that these agencies claim to use to verify the information in my reports. Thus far, I have not received any meaningful information or documentation in response to my requests. 

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) The FCRA outlines specific responsibilities for credit reporting agencies, including the requirement to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Below are specific violations of the FCRA that I believe warrant your investigation : 1. Section 607 ( b ) - Reasonable Procedures : Credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. I have doubts that TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX have adhered to this requirement in my case, as the inaccuracies I reported have not been corrected nor explained. 

2. Section 611 - Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy : Upon receiving my dispute, these agencies are mandated to conduct a reasonable investigation of my claims within 30 days. I submitted my dispute to all three agencies, but they have failed to provide the required investigation results or documentation supporting the accuracy of the reported information. Their lack of response is a clear violation of this section. 

XXXX. Failure to Validate Debts : When I identified the inaccuracies, I requested that the agencies provide validation of the debts and the procedures they used to verify the informations accuracy. Under the FCRA, they are obligated to provide this information and their failure to do so represents another violation of my consumer rights. 

4. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - Duty of Furnishers of Information : Any entity that provides information to consumer reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy of that information. If the information provided is found to be inaccurate, the furnishers have a duty to correct it. I am concerned that the agencies are not holding these furnishers accountable for the inaccurate reporting. 

5. Lack of Adequate Consumer Responses : The agencies have not provided timely or useful responses to my inquiries, which I believe underlines a broader failure to protect consumer rights as mandated by the FCRA. 

Request for Action Given the collective issues I have faced, I respectfully ask the CFPB to conduct a thorough investigation into the practices of TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX regarding how they handle inaccuracies and disputes. Furthermore, I urge your office to compel these agencies to provide their "" Procedures of Accuracy '' and ensure they are compliant with the FCRA requirements. 

As a consumer, I have the right to accurate credit reporting, and the current situation jeopardizes my financial health and fundamental rights. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response. 
I am writing to formally submit a complaint against TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX for multiple violations of federal laws governing credit reporting and consumer privacy. Specifically, I believe these credit reporting agencies have violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( i ) and 1681i, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), 15 U.S.C. 6801-6805, the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), 15 U.S.C. 1666b, and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.

1. Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate and complete information in consumer reports. Section 15 U.S.C. 1681i places a requirement on these agencies to conduct a reasonable investigation when a dispute is raised by a consumer. Despite my numerous attempts to dispute inaccurate information on my credit reports, I have received no effective responses or resolutions. The inaccurate entries include : - [ Specify inaccuracies e.g., incorrect account balances, erroneous public records, etc. ] - [ Provide details on unauthorized inquiries dated, as applicable ] These inaccuracies jeopardize the integrity of my credit report and have impacted my creditworthiness adversely. 

XXXX. Violations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) : The XXXX, specifically XXXX XXXX. XXXX, mandates that financial institutions protect consumer privacy. I have discovered unauthorized inquiries on my credit report for which I did not provide consent. This represents a clear violation of my right to control access to my personal financial information. 

3. Violations of the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) : I believe the actions of these credit bureaus also infringe upon my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1666b, as they have failed to provide proper procedures for disputing billing errors. My written requests and disputes have gone unanswered, violating my rights under this act.

4. Violations of the Privacy Act of 1974 : Under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, I have the right to know what personal information is being collected about me and to whom it is being disclosed. I have been unsuccessful in obtaining this information, especially concerning unauthorized inquiries.

5. Section 1681a ( 2 ) ( I ) : Section 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( 2 ) ( I ) concerns the transactions and experiences commonly used in credit reports. The inaccuracies reported suggest a failure in this area, further undermining my trust in the credit reporting process. 

I expect these agencies to adhere strictly to the provisions of the FCRA and other relevant laws, ensuring they provide accurate, complete, and timely information to consumers. I ask the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate these matters thoroughly and hold these credit bureaus accountable for their actions. 

Thank you for your attention to this significant issue. I look forward to your prompt action in resolving my complaints and restoring the accuracy and integrity of my credit reports.

These inaccuracies violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which requires all information on my credit report to be accurate, complete, and verifiable. Therefore, I request the immediate deletion of this account from my credit file. 

Account Details in Question Creditor Name : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Reported Balance : {$50000.00} Current Balance : {$0.00} Status : Open, 120+ days late Last Payment Recorded : XX/XX/XXXX Disputed Points and Reasons for Deletion 1. Inaccurate Balance Reporting The account reflects a reported balance of {$50000.00} while simultaneously listing a current balance of {$0.00}. This contradiction creates confusion and misleads creditors, as it suggests an unresolved obligation when no balance is owed. 
Why It Needs Deletion : This inaccurate balance violates FCRA 1681c-2, which prohibits reporting of erroneous or conflicting data. If the current balance is indeed {$0.00}, then the {$50000.00} reported balance is inaccurate and must be removed. 
XXXX. Incomplete Payment History The payment history for this account is incomplete, with months marked as No Data. This failure to provide a full and accurate record of payments misrepresents my payment behavior and obligations. 
Why It Needs Deletion : Incomplete or unverifiable payment data violates FCRA 1681i, which requires the correction or removal of unverifiable or incomplete information. If the payment history can not be accurately verified, the account must be removed. 
XXXX. Unsupported Delinquency Status The account is listed as 120+ days late, yet it also reflects a {$0.00} current balance and no payment activity since XX/XX/XXXX. This delinquency status appears inaccurate or outdated and is unsupported by the provided data. 
Why It Needs Deletion : FCRA 1681e ( b ) requires all reported data to be accurate and verifiable. If TransUnion or the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  can not substantiate this delinquency status with evidence, it must be removed, or the entire account deleted. 
XXXX. Violation of FCRA Verification Requirements As required under FCRA 1681i, all data reported to credit bureaus must be verified as accurate and complete. If the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX can not provide verifiable documentation supporting the balance, delinquency status, or payment history, this account must be deleted. 

Supporting Evidence To support my dispute, I have included the following documents : A copy of my drivers license and/or passport for identity verification. 
Payment records, if applicable, demonstrating the resolution of this account. 
[ Optional ] A copy of an FTC Identity Theft Report if this account is misreported due to fraud. 

Requested Action Based on the inaccuracies outlined above, I formally request the following : 1. Conduct a thorough investigation of this account as required by the FCRA. 
XXXX. If the information can not be verified or corrected, delete this account entirely from my credit report. 
XXXX. Provide a detailed summary of your findings, including verification or correction of each disputed point. 

Conclusion This dispute is submitted under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I expect the investigation to be completed within the legally mandated 30-day timeframe. If TransUnion can not verify the accuracy of the reported information within this period, the account must be removed in compliance with the FCRA. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If you require additional information, please contact me at XXXX or via email at XXXX.

These inaccuracies violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which requires all information on my credit report to be accurate, complete, and verifiable. Therefore, I request the immediate deletion of this account from my credit file. 

Account Details in Question Creditor Name : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Reported Balance : {$50000.00} Current Balance : {$0.00} Status : Open, 120+ days late Last Payment Recorded : XX/XX/XXXX Disputed Points and Reasons for Deletion 1. Inaccurate Balance Reporting The account reflects a reported balance of {$50000.00} while simultaneously listing a current balance of {$0.00}. This contradiction creates confusion and misleads creditors, as it suggests an unresolved obligation when no balance is owed. 
Why It Needs Deletion : This inaccurate balance violates FCRA 1681c-2, which prohibits reporting of erroneous or conflicting data. If the current balance is indeed {$0.00}, then the {$50000.00} reported balance is inaccurate and must be removed. 
XXXX. Incomplete Payment History The payment history for this account is incomplete, with months marked as No Data. This failure to provide a full and accurate record of payments misrepresents my payment behavior and obligations. 
Why It Needs Deletion : Incomplete or unverifiable payment data violates FCRA 1681i, which requires the correction or removal of unverifiable or incomplete information. If the payment history can not be accurately verified, the account must be removed. 
XXXX. Unsupported Delinquency Status The account is listed as 120+ days late, yet it also reflects a {$0.00} current balance and no payment activity since XX/XX/XXXX. This delinquency status appears inaccurate or outdated and is unsupported by the provided data. 
Why It Needs Deletion : FCRA 1681e ( b ) requires all reported data to be accurate and verifiable. If TransUnion or the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX can not substantiate this delinquency status with evidence, it must be removed, or the entire account deleted. 
4. Violation of FCRA Verification Requirements As required under FCRA 1681i, all data reported to credit bureaus must be verified as accurate and complete. If the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXan not provide verifiable documentation supporting the balance, delinquency status, or payment history, this account must be deleted. 

Supporting Evidence To support my dispute, I have included the following documents : A copy of my drivers license and/or passport for identity verification. 
Payment records, if applicable, demonstrating the resolution of this account. 
[ Optional ] A copy of an FTC Identity Theft Report if this account is misreported due to fraud. 

Requested Action Based on the inaccuracies outlined above, I formally request the following : 1. Conduct a thorough investigation of this account as required by the FCRA. 
XXXX. If the information can not be verified or corrected, delete this account entirely from my credit report. 
XXXX. Provide a detailed summary of your findings, including verification or correction of each disputed point. 

Conclusion This dispute is submitted under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I expect the investigation to be completed within the legally mandated 30-day timeframe. If TransUnion can not verify the accuracy of the reported information within this period, the account must be removed in compliance with the FCRA. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If you require additional information, please contact me at XXXX or via email at XXXX.

XXXX Account XXXX : XXXX XXXX. XXXX Account Number : XXXX These entries are inaccurate and violate my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). I demand an immediate investigation and correction of these inaccuracies to ensure compliance with federal law. 

Violations of Federal Law 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of any disputed information within 30 days. Failure to do so is a violation of federal law. 

15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) : Mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. The reporting of these inaccurate charge-offs violates this provision.

2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1692g : Debt collectors must validate any debt upon request. If a charge-off can not be validated, it is unlawful for the creditor or debt collector to continue reporting the account.

3. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1635 : Creditors must provide accurate and fair disclosures related to the terms and validity of debts. Reporting charge-offs without proper documentation may constitute a violation of this statute. 




Damages and Remedies If these inaccuracies are not corrected promptly, I reserve the right to pursue legal remedies under the FCRA and FDCPA, including : Statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation. 

Actual damages caused by these inaccuracies, such as increased interest rates, credit denials, or emotional distress. 

Punitive damages for willful noncompliance with federal statutes. 

Recovery of legal fees and associated costs. 


Action Requested I demand the following actions : 1. Conduct a thorough investigation of these accounts to verify their accuracy.

2. Remove the inaccurate charge-off entries from my credit report immediately.

3. Provide a written statement confirming the removal or correction of these entries within 30 days, as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

Next Steps Failure to comply with these demands will leave me no choice but to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and other relevant regulatory bodies. Additionally, I will consult legal counsel to pursue remedies under federal law for the harm caused by these inaccuracies.

This failure raises significant concerns about the accuracy of the information being reported to credit bureaus. 

Account Details : Creditor Name : XXXX Account Balance : {$180.00} Account Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX Continued Reporting : Monthly reporting through XX/XX/XXXX, and still ongoing today. 

I have contacted XXXX requesting a copy of the XXXX form to verify their reporting of this debt as canceled or discharged. However, they have failed to provide the requested documentation or any evidence supporting the continued reporting of this account.

Moreover, this account has been reported monthly as an active account even after its alleged charge-off date, which further raises concerns about its accuracy. Such reporting may be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as it misrepresents the status of the debt.

Actions Requested : 1. Investigate XXXX failure to provide the requested XXXX form for the account listed above. 
XXXX. Verify whether XXXX properly discharged the debt and issued the required documentation to the IRS. 
XXXX. If XXXX can not provide proper documentation, require them to immediately remove any inaccurate or negative reporting related to this account from my credit report. 
XXXX. Address the issue of XXXX continued reporting of this account as active or delinquent despite the alleged charge-off. 


I respectfully request that the CFPB intervene to ensure that XXXX complies with federal laws, including the FCRA, and that accurate reporting standards are maintained. Please let me know if additional information or documentation is required.

The presence of inaccurate information on my credit report is a direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) as specified in 15 USC 1681. The specific violations under the FCRA Include 15 USC 1681 ( e ) ( b ) and 15 USC 1681s-2.

I have thoroughly reviewed the consumer report that I obtained from your agency, and I have identified several items that are factually incorrect and detrimental to my creditworthiness. These inaccuracies have caused severe financial harm and have negatively impacted my ability to secure loans and credit on fair terms.

The disputed information on my credit report is as follows : * [ Clearly state the inaccurate item, such as an account in collections, incorrect account status, late payments, or other discrepancies. ] * [ Provide detailed explanations as to why the information is inaccurate, along with supporting evidence or documentation to substantiate my claims. ] A consumer reporting agency must have reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy and fairness of consumer credit reports. Consequently, I am requesting a thorough investigation into the disputed items and verification of their accuracy in accordance with 15 USC 1681 ( e ) ( b ).

Furthermore, as per 15 USC 1681s-2, I request that you promptly notify the data furnishers associated with the disputed information about my dispute. They are providing inaccurate information and under 15 USC 1681s-2 they are prohibited by law to furnish information that they know is inaccurate or have reason to believe is inaccurate.

You must inform them that the information in question is under dispute, and they must cease reporting this information until a thorough investigation has been completed.

The Following accounts contains multiple inaccurate information : I demand that you conduct a comprehensive and impartial investigation within the time frame mandated by the FCRA, which is 30 days from the date of receipt of this dispute letter. Failure to adhere to these requirements will be regarded as a violation of federal law.

Upon the completion of your investigation, I expect to receive a written report of the results along with a copy of my updated credit report reflecting the necessary deletions.

If your investigation reveals that any of the disputed information is inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable, you must take immediate action to rectify this matter in compliance with 15 USC 1681i ( 5 ). Additionally, I insist that you provide me with written statement confirming that the inaccuracies have been corrected and that the updated credit report has been sent to all parties who have received my consumer report within the past two years.

Please be advised that I am fully aware of my rights under the FCRA, and I am prepared to pursue all legal remedies available to me should you fail to comply with the laws requirements.

As per the Metro2 Reporting Guidelines and the FCRA, I request that you initiate a comprehensive investigation into the disputed items promptly. This includes conducting a Metro2 complaint investigation and contacting the data furnishers associated with the inaccurate information.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter, I expect a timely response and resolution of this dispute in compliance with the FCRA.

Anything other than deletions and updates will result in me seeking monetary damages for each inaccuracy that shows on these credit accounts!

The items I am disputing are as follows : Late Payments 30+ Days : of late payments that are either inaccurate or incomplete.

Late Payments 60+ Days : of late payments that are either inaccurate or incomplete.

Additionally, Derogatory Public Records I demand the removal of any accounts that contain incomplete, inaccurate, or unverifiable information from my credit report.

These inaccuracies are negatively affecting my credit standing and causing significant distress. 

**Details of the Issue : ** - The account in question ( Account Number : XXXX ) has been closed ; however, XXXX  XXXX XXXX continues to update the balance as though the account is active. This is inaccurate and constitutes false reporting under the FCRA.

The FCRA requires that all information reported to credit bureaus be accurate, complete, and up to date. XXXX XXXX  failure to correct this issue is a clear violation of my rights under federal law. As a result, I am requesting immediate action by the CFPB to address this matter. 

**Resolution Requested : ** 1. I demand that this account be **immediately removed** from all three credit reports ( XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX ) due to its inaccurate and misleading reporting. 
XXXX. I request that XXXX XXXX XXXX cease all further reporting of this account and any related balance updates. 

Failure to resolve this issue promptly will result in my pursuit of legal action, including seeking damages for each inaccuracy related to this account, as permitted under the FCRA. 

**Supporting Documentation : ** Enclosed are the following documents to support my complaint : - A copy of my recent credit report showing the inaccurate reporting. 
- Documentation confirming the accounts closed status. 

I trust the CFPB will take immediate and appropriate action to ensure compliance with federal regulations and protect my rights as a consumer. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and provide me with a timeline for your investigation and resolution.

The account in question is as follows : 1. Account Name : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Listed : XXXX. XXXX, XXXX  The balance currently being reported is inaccurate and potentially unlawful. Per Gugger v. USAA Federal Bank, the issuance of a 1099-C form by a creditor indicates the occurrence of an identifiable event of debt cancellation. Under IRS regulations, Event Code 7 defines such an event as a discharge of indebtedness due to the creditors policy decision to cease collection activity and cancel the debt. 

If a 1099-C form has been issued for this account, the debt has been canceled, and reporting a balance is inaccurate and misleading. I am requesting the following : Verification of the Account Balance : Provide evidence demonstrating that the balance is accurate and collectible.

Provision of the 1099-C Form : If issued, provide a copy to verify the identifiable event. 
Immediate Deletion of the Account : If the debt was discharged under Event Code 7 or can not be verified, you are required to delete this negative information under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

Attached, you will find [ list of supporting documents ]. Please investigate this matter within the legally required 30-day timeframe. Failure to respond appropriately will result in further action.

If this account has been canceled or discharged, it should not continue to be reported as delinquent or outstanding. Any continued reporting of a canceled debt is not only inaccurate but could be considered a violation of the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ), which mandates maximum possible accuracy. 

To support my position, courts have consistently ruled on the importance of accurate credit reporting. For instance, in XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), the court ruled that reporting inaccurate information can form the basis of an FCRA claim when a creditor fails to correct or clarify disputed or misleading information. Moreover, in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ), the court held that credit reporting agencies must exercise reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of information reported to consumer credit files. 

Please provide the methods of verification under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) ) used to validate the information being reported. If XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or any credit reporting agency fails to provide proof of permissible purpose or accurate reporting, I will pursue legal remedies, including monetary damages under FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) for any willful or negligent noncompliance. 

I request a prompt response within 30 days to resolve this matter. Please remove any inaccurate or unverifiable information from my credit report, as well as cease any further reporting if proof of permissible purpose or accuracy can not be provided.

The failure to validate these debts and the continued reporting of unverifiable accounts violates provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

These accounts, listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have caused harm to my credit profile and reputation. Below, I outline the applicable legal obligations and my specific grievances : Validation of Debt Is Required Under the FCRA and FDCPA : Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( FDCPA ), a debt collector must, upon written request within 30 days of the initial communication, provide validation of the debt. Validation must include : 1.Proof that the debt exists.

2.Documentation that I am the rightful debtor, such as signed agreements or contracts.

3.An itemized breakdown of the debt amount.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( FCRA ), entities furnishing information to credit reporting agencies must ensure that the data is accurate and verifiable. This includes confirming the legitimacy of debts reported. To date, these accounts have not been validated with proper documentation, yet they remain on my credit report, which is a clear violation of these legal obligations. 

Requirements for Credit Reporting Accuracy : Section 623 of the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) mandates that information furnished to credit reporting agencies must be accurate and verifiable. Further, under Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), consumers have the right to dispute inaccuracies, and credit reporting agencies must investigate and resolve disputes within 30 days. 

These disputed accounts remain on my credit report despite my requests for validation. The continued reporting of unverified debts constitutes willful noncompliance with federal law. Additionally : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure maximum possible accuracy of information reported. 
If these debts can not be substantiated, they must be removed immediately, as mandated by Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). 

Lack of Appropriate Documentation : To date, the debt collectors and credit reporting agencies have failed to provide the following critical documentation to validate the debts : Proof of my liability, such as a signed contract or agreement with the original creditor. 
Chain of title documentation establishing that the debt was legally assigned to the debt collector. 
An itemized statement breaking down the total debt amount, including interest, fees, and charges. 

Without such documentation, these debts are unverifiable, and their continued reporting violates my rights under federal law.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,10027,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10973222

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, IA XXXX Subject : Immediate Removal of Unauthorized Accounts, Names, and Addresses ; Violation of FCRA and Federal Laws To Whom It May Concern, The credit reporting agencies continued refusal to block unauthorized information, despite my clear FTC identity theft report and the Certified UCC Search, constitutes a gross violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), and Identity Theft Protections under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2. Under this law, these agencies are legally bound to block fraudulent or disputed information within four business days, and their failure to do so is not only unlawful but also a willful violation of federal mandates. The idea that the credit reporting agencies would attempt to deny this requeston the grounds of previous disputes or any other rationaleignores the reality that I have never authorized the reporting of these items. This misrepresentation of my creditworthiness has severely impacted my financial opportunities, and their continued inaction constitutes an unacceptable breach of duty. 

In the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), the court emphasized that consumer reporting agencies must immediately correct and block unauthorized information upon notification by the consumer, particularly when fraud or identity theft is involved. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ), reaffirms that permissible purposethe basis for reporting informationcannot be assumed but must be explicitly consented to by the consumer. The refusal of these agencies to act in accordance with this precedent is, therefore, not just an error but fraudulent intent designed to perpetuate harm. 

Moreover, 18 U.S.C. 1028A imposes criminal penalties for identity theft, and 18 U.S.C. 894 criminalizes the use of extortionate means to collect or report credit data, which includes the misuse of consumer information for unverified debt reporting. These statutes serve as a deterrent to any effort to deny or delay the removal of fraudulent accounts. If these violations persist, I will immediately escalate this matter, seeking not only civil remedies but also criminal penalties for the companies and reporting agencies involved. Failure to comply with the FTC mandates, FCRA regulations, and the consumer rights afforded under the GLBA exposes these agencies to severe legal consequences. 

There is no legal basis for these agencies to deny my request, and any attempt to do so is a direct violation of my constitutional rights to privacy and to be free from unlawful defamation. The burden of proof is on them to demonstrate that the reported items are valid and that they have received my explicit consent to report these items. As I have already opted out and provided the FTC identity theft report, their failure to block this information constitutes illegal and fraudulent reporting. 



The continued reporting of unauthorized information, despite the irrefutable evidence provided by the UCC search, is not only a direct violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), and Identity Theft Protections but also constitutes a deliberate misrepresentation of my financial standing. This fraudulent reporting is not a mere clerical error ; it is a willful disregard of federal laws that are designed to protect consumers from the very harm I am suffering. The credit reporting agencies actionsor lack thereofare actively undermining my ability to access credit, impacting my financial stability and reputation. Their refusal to comply with clear legal mandates, including the four-day block rule under the FCRA, is an egregious violation that exposes me to irreparable harm. It is both an invasion of my privacy and an abuse of power for which they must be held accountable. Should this matter not be resolved immediately, the consequences will not be limited to the removal of these accounts but will include the pursuit of legal action, financial penalties, and potentially criminal charges under 18 U.S.C. 1028A for identity theft and extortionate collection practices under 18 U.S.C. 894. The willful negligence by the credit bureaus in upholding their obligations is unacceptable, and I demand swift, decisive action to remove all fraudulent accounts, unauthorized information, and misrepresented data from my credit report without delay. 

This formal complaint is submitted in response to the ongoing violation of my consumer rights by XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX. Despite filing an FTC Identity Theft Report, providing a Certified Georgia UCC Search Report, and opting out of any further unauthorized reporting under federal law, the credit reporting agencies have failed to honor their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Their blatant disregard for the law and failure to block unauthorized accounts within the legally mandated four business days has led to severe damage to my financial reputation, and it must be addressed immediately. 

Unauthorized Accounts : The following accounts are being reported on my credit report without my written consent, authorization, or legal justification. These accounts must be removed immediately : 1. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : {$650.00} Violation : Unauthorized reporting, no validation provided, and no written consent for reporting.

5. XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Balance : Related to a previously removed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
6. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Violation : Unauthorized reporting, late payment reporting without written consent. 

Unauthorized Addresses : The following addresses are being reported without my consent and must be removed immediately : 1. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX Unauthorized Names : The only name that should be reported on my credit report is XXXX XXXX XXXX. The following unauthorized names must be removed immediately : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Violation of Federal Law : 1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRA Section 604A Section 2 ) : Under this section of the FCRA, consumer reporting agencies may only furnish accounts with explicit written authorization. I have not provided written consent for any of these accounts to be reported on my credit report. This constitutes fraud, misrepresentation of my financial standing, and defamation of character. 
2. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( Section 605B ) Failure to Block Fraudulent Information : Once I submitted the FTC Identity Theft Report, the credit reporting agencies were legally obligated to block all disputed and fraudulent information from my report within four business days. They have failed to do so, which is a gross violation of my rights under the FCRA. 
3. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ) ( c ) ( Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) : The credit reporting agencies and financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing nonpublic personal information to a third party without my explicit written consent. Their failure to comply with my opt-out request is a direct violation of this law. 
4. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( Accuracy of Reporting ) : XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX are legally required to ensure the accuracy of the information reported. Their failure to block fraudulent accounts, names, and addresses from my credit report is a violation of this obligation. 

Legal Precedents and Supporting Case Law : 1. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : The FCRA mandates that consumer consent be obtained before reporting any information. Unauthorized use of credit information without consumer consent is a violation of federal law. 
2. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : The failure to remove unauthorized information constitutes a violation of the FCRA. 
3. FTC v. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : The FTC has the authority to enforce actions against entities that engage in unfair or deceptive practices, including unauthorized reporting of consumer information. 

Severe Consequences for Noncompliance : If these unauthorized accounts, addresses, and names are not removed from my credit report within four business days, the following legal actions will be taken : 1. FTC Complaint : I will file a formal complaint with the FTC for violating federal law regarding unauthorized and inaccurate reporting. 
2. Lawsuit for Violations of FCRA, GLBA, and Other Applicable Laws : Willful noncompliance will result in statutory damages, including fines of up to {$1000.00} per violation under FCRA 1681n, along with possible punitive damages for fraud. 
3. Filing an Arbitration Claim : I will pursue arbitration for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of my legal rights, including claims for damages related to defamation, emotional distress, and financial harm caused by these fraudulent entries. 
4. Court Fees and Arbitration Fees : In addition to the penalties above, the companies and credit reporting agencies may face court and arbitration fees totaling {$500.00} to {$3000.00} per claim. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue these claims in full to ensure my rights are upheld and that proper compensation is provided. 

Resolution Request : I demand the following actions be taken immediately : 1. Immediate Removal of All Unauthorized Accounts, Addresses, and Names from my credit report, as mandated by federal law. 
2. Written Confirmation from each credit bureau acknowledging the unauthorized nature of these accounts and confirming their permanent removal. 
3. Verification of Compliance : Each credit bureau must implement improvements to ensure that unauthorized reporting does not occur in the future. 

Conclusion : As a victim of fraudulent and unauthorized reporting, I am entitled to immediate removal of these inaccuracies from my credit report. The credit reporting agencies have ignored their legal obligations, misrepresented my creditworthiness, and caused significant harm to my financial reputation. I expect full compliance with these demands and a resolution within four ( 4 ) business days. If not, I will pursue all legal remedies, including escalating this matter to regulatory authorities.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,31015,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10973365

I demand that this fraudulent information be blocked within four ( 4 ) business days of your receipt of this complaint as required by law. 

The fraudulent, inaccurate, and false information on my credit report includes the following accounts : XXXX XXXX XXXX - Opened on XX/XX/XXXX, under account number XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, under account number XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) - Opened on XX/XX/XXXX, under account number XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX - XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, under account number XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX account opened on XX/XX/XXXX, under account number XXXX, with an unpaid balance of {$16000.00}.

XXXX XXXX XXXX - Opened on XX/XX/XXXX, under account number XXXX 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, under account number XXXX. 
XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, under account number XXXX. 
Additionally, fraudulent collections and hard inquiries have resulted from these accounts, including : A collections account opened at XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$16000.00}. 
A collections account opened at US Department of Education for {$5700.00}. 
Other hard inquiries related to these accounts, fraudulently initiated using my stolen personal information. 
I do not recognize any of these accounts, collections, or hard inquiries as reported. These items were not opened, made, or authorized by me and are the result of identity theft and fraud. 

Supporting Evidence : To support my complaint, I have attached the following documentation : FTC Identity Theft Affidavit ( Criminal Complaint # [ PRIVATE CASE NUMBER ] ) substantiating my claim of identity theft and fraud. 
A copy of my consumer credit report with fraudulent accounts, collections, and hard inquiries highlighted. 
A detailed list of fraudulent hard inquiries. 
Copies of my government-issued identification and proof of residence to verify my identity. 
Explanation of Harm : These fraudulent accounts and collections have resulted in significant harm to my credit report, including derogatory marks, reduced credit scores, and additional hard inquiries. These inaccuracies are negatively affecting my financial opportunities and creditworthiness. Under FCRA 605B, it is your legal obligation to block these fraudulent accounts, collections, and inquiries from my credit file within four ( 4 ) business days of receiving this complaint. 

Demand for Relief : I respectfully request that Equifax take the following actions : Block all fraudulent accounts, collections, and hard inquiries identified in this complaint from my consumer credit file within four ( 4 ) business days of receiving this complaint, as required under FCRA 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ). 
Provide written confirmation of the removal of these fraudulent items from my consumer credit file. 
Cease and desist all attempts to verify these fraudulent accounts with creditors without notifying me first and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws. 
If Equifax decides to verify these fraudulent items, this action would violate my rights under FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, and potentially subject the agency to penalties under both the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) for willful negligence and further harm. I expect strict compliance with FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) and all other relevant statutes. 

Failure to comply with my request may result in legal action to enforce my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Uniform Commercial Code. 

Legal Notice : Please send written confirmation of the actions taken in response to this complaint to my email at XXXX. This written confirmation must include the date and details of all fraudulent items removed from my credit file. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

As a victim of identity theft, I have experienced fraudulent charges that have severely impacted my financial situation. In XX/XX/year>, I submitted fraud claims to Capital One for both my bank account and credit card accounts. However, to date, my accounts have not been credited for the fraudulent charges, which is beyond the legal time frame for resolving such issues as outlined in the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ). 

Capital One customer service representatives have informed me that I must wait up to 90 days for the completion of their investigation before any credits can be released. This extended delay is causing significant financial distress, as the inaccurate balances on my accounts continue to create additional problems for me, affecting my ability to access funds and manage my finances responsibly. 

According to Section 1693g of the EFTA, consumers are entitled to prompt investigation and resolution of unauthorized electronic fund transfers. Furthermore, the FCBA provides consumers with rights regarding the investigation of billing errors. The lack of timely action on my claims not only violates my rights as a consumer but also hinders my ability to resolve the detrimental effects of identity theft. 

I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate this matter and assist in ensuring that Capital One adheres to the requirements set forth by federal law.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Dear CFPB, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request an investigation into the procedures employed by the major credit reporting agenciesTransUnion, Equifax, and Experianregarding the accuracy of information reported on my credit file. I am concerned about certain inaccuracies that I have identified and the subsequent failure of these agencies to provide adequate responses and documentation, which I believe constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Background Recently, I submitted complaints to XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX regarding incorrect information reported on my credit reports. Despite my efforts to address these inaccuracies, I have not received satisfactory responses or valid proof of the claims made by these agencies. Most importantly, I have repeatedly requested to review the "" Procedures of Accuracy '' that these agencies claim to use to verify the information in my reports. Thus far, I have not received any meaningful information or documentation in response to my requests. 

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) The FCRA outlines specific responsibilities for credit reporting agencies, including the requirement to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Below are specific violations of the FCRA that I believe warrant your investigation : 1. Section 607 ( b ) - Reasonable Procedures : Credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. I have doubts that XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX have adhered to this requirement in my case, as the inaccuracies I reported have not been corrected nor explained. 

2. Section 611 - Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy : Upon receiving my dispute, these agencies are mandated to conduct a reasonable investigation of my claims within 30 days. I submitted my dispute to all three agencies, but they have failed to provide the required investigation results or documentation supporting the accuracy of the reported information. Their lack of response is a clear violation of this section. 

XXXX. Failure to Validate Debts : When I identified the inaccuracies, I requested that the agencies provide validation of the debts and the procedures they used to verify the informations accuracy. Under the FCRA, they are obligated to provide this information and their failure to do so represents another violation of my consumer rights. 

4. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - Duty of Furnishers of Information : Any entity that provides information to consumer reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy of that information. If the information provided is found to be inaccurate, the furnishers have a duty to correct it. I am concerned that the agencies are not holding these furnishers accountable for the inaccurate reporting.

5. Lack of Adequate Consumer Responses : The agencies have not provided timely or useful responses to my inquiries, which I believe underlines a broader failure to protect consumer rights as mandated by the FCRA. 

Request for Action Given the collective issues I have faced, I respectfully ask the CFPB to conduct a thorough investigation into the practices of XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX regarding how they handle inaccuracies and disputes. Furthermore, I urge your office to compel these agencies to provide their "" Procedures of Accuracy '' and ensure they are compliant with the FCRA requirements.

As a consumer, I have the right to accurate credit reporting, and the current situation jeopardizes my financial health and fundamental rights. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response. 
I am writing to formally submit a complaint against XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX for multiple violations of federal laws governing credit reporting and consumer privacy. Specifically, I believe these credit reporting agencies have violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( i ) and 1681i, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), 15 U.S.C. 6801-6805, the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), 15 U.S.C. 1666b, and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. 

1. Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate and complete information in consumer reports. Section 15 U.S.C. 1681i places a requirement on these agencies to conduct a reasonable investigation when a dispute is raised by a consumer. Despite my numerous attempts to dispute inaccurate information on my credit reports, I have received no effective responses or resolutions. The inaccurate entries include : - [ Specify inaccuracies e.g., incorrect account balances, erroneous public records, etc. ] - [ Provide details on unauthorized inquiries dated, as applicable ] These inaccuracies jeopardize the integrity of my credit report and have impacted my creditworthiness adversely. 

2. Violations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) : The GLBA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 6801-6805, mandates that financial institutions protect consumer privacy. I have discovered unauthorized inquiries on my credit report for which I did not provide consent. This represents a clear violation of my right to control access to my personal financial information.

3. Violations of the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) : I believe the actions of these credit bureaus also infringe upon my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1666b, as they have failed to provide proper procedures for disputing billing errors. My written requests and disputes have gone unanswered, violating my rights under this act.

4. Violations of the Privacy Act of 1974 : Under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, I have the right to know what personal information is being collected about me and to whom it is being disclosed. I have been unsuccessful in obtaining this information, especially concerning unauthorized inquiries. 

5. Section 1681a ( 2 ) ( I ) : Section 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( 2 ) ( I ) concerns the transactions and experiences commonly used in credit reports. The inaccuracies reported suggest a failure in this area, further undermining my trust in the credit reporting process. 

I expect these agencies to adhere strictly to the provisions of the FCRA and other relevant laws, ensuring they provide accurate, complete, and timely information to consumers. I ask the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate these matters thoroughly and hold these credit bureaus accountable for their actions. 

Thank you for your attention to this significant issue. I look forward to your prompt action in resolving my complaints and restoring the accuracy and integrity of my credit reports.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am writing to dispute the incorrect reporting of late payments on my credit file for the following accounts : XXXX. XXXX Account XXXX : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX ( Late Pay ) XXXX. XXXX Account XXXX : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX ( Late Pay ) These late payment notations are inaccurate and violate multiple provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), and relevant regulations. I am requesting an immediate investigation and the removal of these incorrect entries to ensure compliance with federal law. 

Violations of Federal Law 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( xi ) : Credit reporting agencies and furnishers must ensure that all information included in a consumers credit file is accurate and verifiable. Reporting unverifiable or inaccurate late payments breaches this standard.

15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 : Furnishers of information are legally required to report accurate data and promptly correct errors when notified.

2. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1666 ( b ) : Billing errors, including misreported late payments, must be thoroughly investigated and resolved by creditors. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes a direct violation of federal law.

3. Regulations Implementing TILA : 12 CFR 1026.13 : This regulation outlines the obligations of creditors to investigate and resolve billing disputes, including errors in reporting late payments. Noncompliance with this regulation is subject to penalties. 




Damages and Remedies If these inaccuracies are not corrected promptly, I reserve the right to seek remedies under the following provisions : Statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation under FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 1681o ).

Actual damages resulting from the inaccuracies, including higher interest rates, credit denials, and emotional distress.

Punitive damages for willful noncompliance.

Recovery of legal fees and associated costs related to pursuing this matter.

Action Requested I am requesting that : 1. A comprehensive investigation be conducted for the accounts listed above in compliance with FCRA and TILA.

2. All inaccurate late payment entries be promptly removed from my credit report.

3. A written confirmation of the resolution be sent to me within 30 days, as required by 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). 



Next Steps I trust that your team will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves and resolve it promptly. If this issue is not corrected, I will be compelled to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and other relevant regulatory agencies. Additionally, I will consult legal counsel to pursue remedies under the law for the harm caused by these inaccuracies. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

I set up automatic payments. My payment was for {$150.00}. That first payment said I was delinquent and owed an additional {$52.00}. When I contacted the company I was told multiple different things including, I need to pay the delinquent amount, they dont know why my accounts were not paid and that this was an oversight that would have fixed itself if I left it alone. Essentially, the company has paid XXXX out of XXXX of my accounts. This continued to show delinquency through XXXX when I called them again and contacted the Federal Department of Education and filed a formal complaint. In XXXX, Aidvantage acknowledged I overplayed the account and would remedy past payments to reflect accurate payments of all XXXX loans. They also said due to overpayment they would modify my payments for the next XXXX payments ( XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX would be {$52.00} and XX/XX/XXXX would be {$18.00} ). On XXXX XXXX, I checked my bank account and saw a pending transaction from Aidvantage for {$110.00}, I double checked my account on Aidvantage which stated my payment of {$52.00} was pending, however, the next day the transaction hit my account at {$110.00} and I also received a new notice from Aidvantage that XXXX and XXXX payments would now be {$110.00}, with no prior statement to change for XXXX. When I contacted Aidvantage about illegally taking more than double the payment from my account, they only responded that they were legally in their right. With this payment I also received a notice that despite my overpayment of more than double what my statement was, I was also delinquent again on my account. I have tried numerous times in XXXX and XXXX to contact Aidvantage to rectify the problem and they will not respond to my requests. On XXXX XXXX I paid the next payment of {$110.00} and today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received another delinquency notice of {$52.00}. I am tired of being told I am delinquent each month, having failure to have Aidvantage respond to each request and Aidvantage failing to properly pay my loans from my automatic payments.",,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",KS,670XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10974467

According to proper procedure, fraudulent credit reporting issues are handled through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), not the FTC. 
XXXX website directs consumers to file reports via the CFPB through the FTC Fraud Report system.

However EQIFAX does't know this and I was informed that my file did not include an FTC report . Therefore, my disputes include reports made through the CFPB, and I have attached the necessary documentation to support my claim. 

I urge CFPB to educate Equifax to update your internal policies to align with changes adopted by the major credit bureaus. This ensures your representatives, who are supposed to assist customers, are properly informed and do not provide inaccurate or misleading guidance.

Miscommunication such as this only adds to the frustration caused by incorrect credit reporting and may result in legitimate disputes being improperly handled.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NY,11226,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978067

The issues I am experiencing are outlined below : 1. Duplicate Reporting of the Same Debt Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), creditors and collection agencies are prohibited from furnishing inaccurate or misleading information to credit bureaus. My credit report shows the same debt reported multiple times by different entities : Original Lender : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX Investments Both accounts reflect the same original balance of {$990.00}, the same current balance of {$990.00}, and the same date assigned ( XX/XX/year> ). This duplicative reporting is misleading, unfairly impacts my credit score, and violates the FCRA requirement for accuracy in credit reporting. 

2. Incomplete or Missing Information Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information. However, XXXX of the entries is missing key details ( e.g., the "" Agency Name '' is blank for one account ). This lack of information prevents me from understanding who owns the debt and whether it is being reported correctly. 

3. Failure to Update Information Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ), furnishers are required to update information to ensure accuracy. If this debt has been sold or reassigned, the original creditor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) should no longer report it. However, both entities are reporting the debt, suggesting the information is not being updated. 

4. Misrepresentation of Debt Responsibility If the debt has been transferred or sold to a collection agency, it is misleading for both the original creditor and the new collection agency to report the debt simultaneously. This violates the FCRA, as it creates confusion regarding the debt 's true ownership and status.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MI,48197,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978538

I request immediate investigation and removal of the following accounts from my credit report : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I assert the following rights and request specific actions to address this issue : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( FCRA 611 ) : I request that the disputed information be investigated and verified as accurate. If the disputed accounts can not be verified, they must be deleted from my credit report.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( FCRA 607 ) : Equifax is obligated to ensure maximum possible accuracy in reporting my credit information. These accounts are inaccurate and result from identity theft or misreporting tied to the referenced data breach.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( FCRA 605A ( b ) ) : I request that these fraudulent items be removed as they stem from a breach of my personal data.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( FCRA 609 ) : I request access to all documentation, records, and communications related to the inclusion of these accounts on my credit report.

Given the widespread data breaches that have affected financial institutions and compromised consumers ' sensitive information, I believe these accounts may have been fraudulently opened or erroneously reported. I demand that these accounts be thoroughly investigated in compliance with FCRA requirements and deleted from my credit report if found unverifiable or inaccurate.

Additionally, under the Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 45 ), it is illegal for businesses to engage in unfair or deceptive practices. Reporting inaccurate or fraudulent accounts on my credit report due to negligence in protecting consumer data constitutes a violation of this statute.

I have attached all relevant documents to support this dispute, including copies of my Equifax credit report highlighting the disputed accounts.

Please confirm receipt of this dispute and keep me informed about the progress of the investigation. If Equifax does not resolve this issue promptly, I reserve the right to pursue additional actions to ensure compliance with FCRA regulations.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,337XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978871

XXXX XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, the issuance of a 1099-C form by a creditor indicates the occurrence of an identifiable event of debt cancellation. Under IRS regulations, Event Code 7 defines such an event as a discharge of indebtedness due to the creditors policy decision to cease collection activity and cancel the debt.

If a 1099-C form has been issued for this account, the debt has been canceled, and reporting a balance is inaccurate and misleading. I am requesting the following : Verification of the Account Balance : Provide evidence demonstrating that the balance is accurate and collectible.

Provision of the 1099-C Form : If issued, provide a copy to verify the identifiable event.

Immediate Deletion of the Account : If the debt was discharged under Event Code 7 or can not be verified, you are required to delete this negative information under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

Attached, you will find [ list of supporting documents ]. Please investigate this matter within the legally required 30-day timeframe. Failure to respond appropriately will result in further action.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Unable to get your credit report or credit score,Other problem getting your report or credit score,"XXXX Equifax was contacted due to problems with accessing my.equifax login. Upon initial attempts to access site I was able to gain access and was currently trying to review the information I was looking for when I was rerouted out of the site back to the login screen. I attempted to login again with the same credentials and received an error message with instructions to call a number and I called. After holding I was connected with a woman who ask if I was using a XXXX XXXX to login, I answered yes. She wanted me to use XXXX XXXX, so I switched phones to my android phone and proceeded with the XXXX XXXX browser and attempted to login and received the same error message. She wanted my email and to send me a reset link to reset my password for the equifax account. I had already reset my password for the account before accessing the account previously when I was kicked off of it. During the time I was in the account previously however I had time to dispute one thing in the equifax report of a credit card I didn't recognize. It shows open but under the other part it said terminated. I don't know what that means for a credit card, but it had no payment info, no balance on it and no information historically. As soon as i was done with the dispute and returned back to the report and began to scroll down it flashed some then it kicked me out of the program. I have not been able to access it since. While on the phone with equifax I decided to go ahead and ask about the credit card that I was trying to check on originally that was not showing on my credit report I had been instructed to contact the credit bureaus about myself by the credit card company. That is when she told me that she had no information on the credit card and I should call the company back and tell them to report it. From what I have read the credit bureaus are supposed to investigate these things when it is reported to them by a certain amount of time and respond to the consumer of the findings in writing. Either way, I am not the secretary for XXXX XXXX or equifax, nor am I there for them to waste my time or my money in interest rates and phone calls. I have spent XXXX hours and XXXX minutes on this just this afternoon alone. I have had a credit card from XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX that has never had a late payment, and I just activated my replacement XXXX XXXX XXXX  today for the expiring titanium XXXX XXXX I received back then. I feel I have been more than patient and polite about this situation. My patients however and southern manners are wearing thin. Quite thin. Not once has my credit card ever been reported to any of the credit bureaus yet. I have documentation in text and email from XXXX XXXX stating XX/XX/XXXX that this would be corrected and sent to the XXXX agencies. Today I was told to contact the agencies myself and tell them to update my credit report because they had sent my account information to the bureaus but it just has not been updated. If I do not pay my bill they would report me. This is clearly something that should be punished. Both to the credit bureaus and to the credit card companies. It affects people 's money and credit worthiness. This is my only credit card for a reason. I do not want more credit cards as I do not need what I can not pay for at the time of purchase in my opinion. I prefer not to spend money frivolous and I should not be punished for that.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,301XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978005

Despite being a documented victim of the Equifax data breach, Equifax continues to inaccurately report the following accounts on my credit report : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : This account is being reported as a charge-off repeatedly every month, falsely manipulating the payment history and extending its negative impact on my credit. This practice violates FCRA Section 605 ( c ) and Section 623, which require accurate reporting and prohibit altering the date of first delinquency ( DOFD ). 

XXXX XXXX : This account is being inaccurately reported with a XXXX balance but is listed as a charge-off/collection without proper payment history, creating a misleading and incomplete record. This also violates FCRA Section 623, as it fails to meet accuracy standards.

Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Balance : {$1500.00} Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Balance : {$0.00} Furthermore, Equifax has failed to investigate and correct these inaccuracies despite multiple disputes, violating FCRA Section 605B, which grants identity theft victims the right to have fraudulent accounts blocked or deleted within four business days. Equifax 's negligence in addressing these issues constitutes a direct violation of my rights under federal law.

I am requesting that the CFPB hold Equifax accountable for these violations, ensure these accounts are removed from my credit report, and take necessary enforcement actions to prevent further harm caused by their non-compliance.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30248,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10970183

Additionally, I request immediate verification of the accounts accuracy and ownership under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

**Account Information : ** Creditor : XXXX XXXX  According to 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ), if an item is deleted from a consumers credit file as a result of a dispute, it can not be reinserted without proper notification and certification of its accuracy. I have reviewed my credit report and discovered that this account was deleted and later reinserted without such notification. This action is unlawful and constitutes a breach of my rights under the FCRA. 

Furthermore, under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are required to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. The reinsertion of this account without proper verification undermines this obligation. I believe this reinsertion is inaccurate and demands immediate correction.

**Requested Actions : ** 1. Remove the aforementioned account from my credit report immediately due to its unlawful reinsertion.

2. Provide me with all documentation and verification that this account is mine, as required by the FCRA.

3. Cease any further reporting of this accou
nt unless and until its accuracy is fully validated.

4. Notify me in writing within five ( 5 ) business days of the completion of these actions, as mandated by law.

Please be advised that if these violations are not addressed promptly, I will have no choice but to pursue legal action for damages as permitted under the FCRA. Your failure to comply with federal regulations has negatively impacted my credit profile, causing undue harm. 

I have attached a copy of my ID and proof of address to facilitate your investigation. Please consider this letter a formal complaint, and I expect a written response within 30 days, as required by law.

XXXX XXXX reporting of a late payment, if inaccurate or disputable, compromises the reliability of the banking and credit system and unfairly harms me as a consumer. 
Unfair Practices in Reporting : Section 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) obligates creditors and credit reporting agencies to handle information with fairness and respect for the consumer 's right to privacy. XXXX XXXX actions in this case fail to uphold these principles, as they reported the payment as late despite my compliance with applicable consumer protection laws or a misunderstanding that could have been resolved before reporting. 
Breach of Responsibility to Ensure Accuracy : Section 1681 ( b ) requires consumer reporting systems to operate fairly, equitably, and accurately while protecting confidentiality. XXXX XXXX late payment reporting fails to meet this standard, introducing errors into my credit file that unfairly damage my reputation and creditworthiness. 
Violation of Payment Timing Protections ( 15 U.S.C. 1666b ) : Under 15 U.S.C. 1666b, creditors may not treat payments on open-end credit plans as late if received by XXXX XXXX. on the due date and in the correct amount and format.

The account in question is as follows : 1. Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The balance currently being reported is inaccurate and potentially unlawful. Per Gugger v. USAA Federal Bank, the issuance of a 1099-C form by a creditor indicates the occurrence of an identifiable event of debt cancellation. Under IRS regulations, Event Code 7 defines such an event as a discharge of indebtedness due to the creditors policy decision to cease collection activity and cancel the debt.

If a 1099-C form has been issued for this account, the debt has been canceled, and reporting a balance is inaccurate and misleading. I am requesting the following : Verification of the Account Balance : Provide evidence demonstrating that the balance is accurate and collectible.

Provision of the 1099-C Form : If issued, provide a copy to verify the identifiable event.

Immediate Deletion of the Account : If the debt was discharged under Event Code 7 or can not be verified, you are required to delete this negative information under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Please investigate this matter within the legally required 30-day timeframe. Failure to respond appropriately will result in further action.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

2024-11-30,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Unexpected increase in interest rate,"To whom it may concern, I am writing to file a complaint regarding the APR on my credit card, which at one point exceeded the range of the offered APR. While I understand that the APR is variable and tied to changes in the federal funds rate, I am concerned because my credit score is currently above XXXX, I have never missed a payment, did not carry a balance on the card for many months, and have payed off in full when utilized.

Initially, my APR was around 23 %, which was at the lower end of the offered range. However, it recently increased to the maximum APR, and at one point, it even exceeded the highest offered APR. This makes me believe I may have been incorrectly penalized at some point.

Unfortunately, when I reached out to Chase, I was told that no resolution was available and that there was no additional information I could receive. I was instead provided with the corporate offices mailing address.

I would appreciate it if this matter could be thoroughly investigated and resolved, as I believe I have been unfairly assigned an APR that exceeds the offered range for someone with my credit profile. Ultimately, what I am concerned about is the lack of oversight in calculating customers creditworthiness and the predatory nature of misinformation being provided by Chase.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Updates on how this is being handled would be greatly appreciated.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,WA,98119,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10980568

The loan has a fixed rate of 2 % and minimum payment of {$370.00} a month. When it was first transferred, they had it as a variable rate with different payment amounts. It took nine months, XXXX to XXXX, to get it resolved. From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, it was correct with the 2 % fixed rate and payment of {$370.00}. We received notification of our loan being transferred from Shellpoint to another loan company as of XX/XX/XXXX. We then received notification that the previous notification was sent in error and the loan was not being transferred. We received the XXXX statement due XX/XX/XXXX and it had gone back to a variable rate with a higher payment. Called XX/XX/XXXX and asked for it to be resolved and was given reference number XXXX. Called back on XX/XX/XXXX to make payment because it would not allow me to make my normal payment amount online or through automated phone system because it was less than the minimum amount they were showing due. Took payment with reference number XXXX. Called back on XX/XX/XXXX for an update and was told that my original note was for a variable rate and they need the paperwork showing a fixed rate. Made a payment over the phone with reference number XXXX. We tried to obtain paperwork from original loan company. On XX/XX/XXXX a gentleman dropped off a letter stating our loan was past due and our house was at risk for foreclosure. We were able to find the documentation that showed the 2 % fixed rate and payment of {$370.00}. I emailed it to XXXX and XXXX as I was instructed to do in the past. I also called to have it looked into again and make a payment. Payment was made over the phone with reference number XXXX. Called again on XX/XX/XXXX and it was to have been escalated. On XX/XX/XXXX another letter was delivered. On XX/XX/XXXX called and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX explained my situation and he then transferred me to a gentleman in loss mitigation. He then transferred me to a XXXX who told me nothing was being done because I need to submit my request in writting by mail to Shellpoint. I demanded speaking with a supervisor because I keep getting told different things and need this resolved. Spoke with XXXX XXXX. She told me I need to speak with someone in the HELOC department and said that a XXXX from HELOC credit would be calling me. I never received a call and had to call back on XX/XX/XXXX. Initially spoke with XXXX and asked to be transferred to a supervisor. I was then transferred to XXXX again. Told her I never received a call. She then got in contact with XXXX again and asked that she call me. XXXX then called me and said that she sees that it should be a 2 % fixed rate with a payment of {$370.00} and that she was reviewing my open work order. She put in a work order to get all of my payments applied properly and then to correct the payment amount on the account. She also took a payment with reference number XXXX. XXXX said she would monitor my account. She said it should be XXXX business days for payments to be applied and XXXX business days for payment calculations to be corrected but it was escalted so should be XXXX business days. She said she would follow up with me. If nothing, call back and ask for her. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, no one has contacted me and this has still not been resolved.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I obtained my Equifax credit report on line. There were U. S. Bankruptcy Court items listed on my credit reports. Per the FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) : If the Credit Bureau can not VALIDATE the information with the ORIGINAL CREDITOR, they must remove said information from the consumer credit file.

The Bankruptcy Courts have mailed me letters which emphatically stated that they do NOT provide any information to credit reporting agencies, nor do they ever validate and/or confirm public records. It is the credit reporting agencies, and/or other third party providers who collect information regarding public cases from public records. Public records information is NEVER validated by the U. S. Court system due to the Fair Credit Reporting Agency PRIVACY LAW.

My inquiry to the U. S. Bankruptcy Courts confirmed Equifax Credit Bureau has never validated or verified these public record entries on my credit report, neither will they ever be by them. They further stated while they are NOT liable or responsible for any MISUSE or INCORRECT public records, nor the distribution of said information, public records may, and oftentimes are, reported by third party sources unawares to the consumer, and in most cases, incorrectly. Considering the information indicating a Fair Credit Reporting Act violation, I need all tax lien and bankruptcy information currently showing under my social security number to be PERMANENTLY DELETED from my credit report immediately.

The EQUIFAX Credit Bureau needs to provide me with copies of all documentation associated with these Public Record Accounts bearing either a court order to place this information in my credit report, or my authorization of release bearing my signature. In the meantime, to be in full compliance with the FCRA laws and guidelines, all the information listed under Public Records needs to be immediately deleted from the credit file you maintain under my name and social security number. Be further advised that I am closely monitoring my credit file. Per the Federal Law, you have exactly 30 days to complete this investigation as outlined per the Fair Credit Reporting Act 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).

Per the Federal Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ), you are required by federal law to verify through physical verification of the original signed consumer contract and/or judgment ( XXXX ) all accounts and public information that you post on anyones credit report. Otherwise, anyone paying for your reporting services could fax, mail, email in fraudulent and erroneous account information. As such, if this unauthorized public record information is not deleted from my credit report within the next 30 days, I will be filing a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
Failure to respond in a satisfactory manner within 30 days of receipt of this certified letter will result in a small claims action against the EQUIFAX Credit Reporting Bureau. I will be seeking no less than {$5000.00} in damages for, but not limited to : 1 ) Defamation ; 2 ) Negligent Enhancement of Identity Fraud ; 3 ) Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Despite multiple disputes and submission of the required documentation, Equifax has failed to take appropriate action, claiming that they have not received the necessary evidencea blatant falsehood. 

The fraudulent accounts on my credit report are the result of identity theft stemming from the Equifax data breach, which exposed my personal information to criminals. I have already submitted updated identification and documentation to Equifax multiple times, yet these inaccuracies remain unresolved. The fraudulent accounts that Equifax continues to report include : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In addition to the fraudulent accounts, Equifax has failed to remove outdated and fraudulent addresses tied to these accounts, including : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX These addresses are not associated with me, and I have provided proof of identity theft and the data breach as well as updated identification. XXXX continued inaction perpetuates inaccuracies on my credit report, harming my creditworthiness and financial stability. 

Equifax has claimed on multiple occasions that they did not receive my documentation, despite my providing clear and verifiable evidence. This is not only a failure of compliance but also an attempt to obstruct the resolution of my disputes. Such behavior directly violates the FCRA, which mandates that credit reporting agencies : Conduct reasonable and thorough investigations of disputes within XXXX  days. 
Remove inaccurate, unverifiable, or fraudulent information promptly. 
Provide transparency and clear documentation of their investigative process.

I demand an immediate investigation and correction of these inaccuracies to ensure compliance with federal law. 

Violations of Federal Law 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of any disputed information within 30 days. Failure to do so is a violation of federal law.

15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) : Mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. The reporting of these inaccurate charge-offs violates this provision. 



2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1692g : Debt collectors must validate any debt upon request. If a charge-off can not be validated, it is unlawful for the creditor or debt collector to continue reporting the account.

3. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : 15 U.S. Code 1635 : Creditors must provide accurate and fair disclosures related to the terms and validity of debts. Reporting charge-offs without proper documentation may constitute a violation of this statute.

Damages and Remedies If these inaccuracies are not corrected promptly, I reserve the right to pursue legal remedies under the FCRA and FDCPA, including : Statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation.

Actual damages caused by these inaccuracies, such as increased interest rates, credit denials, or emotional distress.

Punitive damages for willful noncompliance with federal statutes.

Recovery of legal fees and associated costs.

Action Requested I demand the following actions : 1. Conduct a thorough investigation of these accounts to verify their accuracy.

2. Remove the inaccurate charge-off entries from my credit report immediately.

3. Provide a written statement confirming the removal or correction of these entries within 30 days, as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

Next Steps Failure to comply with these demands will leave me no choice but to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and other relevant regulatory bodies. Additionally, I will consult legal counsel to pursue remedies under federal law for the harm caused by these inaccuracies.

This failure raises significant concerns about the accuracy of the information being reported to credit bureaus. 

Account Details : Creditor Name : XXXX  Account Balance : {$180.00} Account Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX Continued Reporting : Monthly reporting through XX/XX/XXXX, and still ongoing today. 

I have contacted XXXX requesting a copy of the XXXX form to verify their reporting of this debt as canceled or discharged. However, they have failed to provide the requested documentation or any evidence supporting the continued reporting of this account. 

Moreover, this account has been reported monthly as an active account even after its alleged charge-off date, which further raises concerns about its accuracy. Such reporting may be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as it misrepresents the status of the debt. 

Actions Requested : XXXX. Investigate XXXX failure to provide the requested XXXX form for the account listed above. 
XXXX. Verify whether XXXX properly discharged the debt and issued the required documentation to the IRS. 
XXXX. If XXXX can not provide proper documentation, require them to immediately remove any inaccurate or negative reporting related to this account from my credit report. 
XXXX. Address the issue of XXXX continued reporting of this account as active or delinquent despite the alleged charge-off. 


I respectfully request that the CFPB intervene to ensure that XXXX complies with federal laws, including the FCRA, and that accurate reporting standards are maintained. Please let me know if additional information or documentation is required.

I submitted a written request for verification of this account on XX/XX/XXXX, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), particularly Section 609 ( a ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ), which mandates that consumers have the right to access accurate information in their files. To date, I have not received any legitimate verification or satisfactory response from your agency.

Upon reviewing my credit report, I have identified several discrepancies regarding the handling of this XXXX  account : Last Payment Date : The last payment date reported varies among agencies ; for instance, XXXX and XXXX reflect a payment on XX/XX/XXXX, yet the Equifax report lacks clarity in this respect. 

XXXX XXXX : All reporting agencies indicate a balance of {$0.00}, which raises significant questions about the consistency and accuracy of this account 's reporting. 

Date of Last Activity : Equifax states the date of last activity was XX/XX/XXXX, while other agencies show differing dates ( e.g., XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX ). This inconsistency warrants immediate clarification. 

Account Status Variations : The account status is reported as "" Closed '' across various agencies, yet the accompanying payment statuses ( such as "" Collection '' or "" Charge-Off '' ) create confusion regarding its standing.

Derogatory Reporting : There is conflicting information regarding the derogatory status of this account, with it being marked as "" Paid '' in some instances while indicated as "" Derogatory '' elsewhere, which could adversely affect my credit score.

Furthermore, your failure to respond to my request for verification of the debt within the FCRA standard timeframe constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA, as it undermines my ability to challenge the accuracy of the information reported and ensures that unverifiable debt remains on my credit report. 

Given the lack of proper validation of this XXXX account and the discrepancies outlined above, I demand the immediate deletion of this account from my credit report. The FCRA stipulates that if a debt can not be properly verified, it must be removed. 

I expect your prompt attention to this matter and anticipate a resolution within the legally required timeframe. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and inform me of the steps that will be taken moving forward.

These inaccuracies are negatively affecting my credit standing and causing significant distress.

**Resolution Requested : ** XXXX. I demand that this account be **immediately removed** from all three credit reports ( XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax ) due to its inaccurate and misleading reporting. 
XXXX. I request that XXXX XXXX XXXX cease all further reporting of this account and any related balance updates.

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided. 

This is unfair, illegal, fraudulent, and not equitable to me as a consumer!

First off spoke with some guy named XXXX, I had a couple questions about a balance transfer. I asked to speak with the supervisor in order to prevent my time from being wasted in the process. I gave him my full name and my full social security number simply because I did not want to go into the other room and grab the card number. So I asked him to verify the account using my social hence provided him that for that reason in the process, for whatever reason, he transferred me to a fraud department rep named XXXX who rudely wasted my time transfer me to supervisor named. XXXX refused to provide me her name and stated he could not provide people 's names which is untrue and XXXX verified that that was also false. XXXX was not able to get XXXX on the phone after she said that was her supervisor. She came back with some lady named XXXX XXXX who stated that she was not a supervisor that they were in the fraud department and that essentially after establishing all that all this time had been wasted because I called in about a balance transfer question and XXXX transfer me over to the fraud department. XXXX didn't ask any questions. Simply wasted my time and then made things more difficult than they had to be after my time was wasted with XXXX extensively. I gave up and then tried to reach my app later on which I had no problems with prior to me calling in earlier and speaking with XXXX and mind you, I did forget I did call in twice before speaking with XXXX and was hung up on as well by two different people. The only person I can remember the name of who hung up on me earlier that time was XXXX. Small world cuz I think I've spoke with XXXX before and she treated me similar to XXXX tonight in the sense that. When I saw my app had now been limited for whatever reason from the four digits of the card, I tried to attempt to ask somebody some questions earlier, which I never was even able to ask the questions based on the processes and procedures that were put in front of me after incorrectly being transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

On the call place to Citibank where XXXX picked up after my app was limited access, I provided him my security word within 1 minute of the phone call beginning. I asked him to please get a supervisor on the phone as soon as possible to prevent any time from being wasted more so than it already has been. He said that he would get one quickly. I said amazing. Almost 11 minutes went by while he had me on mute. He never came back to check once. He never provided any update in the process. After waiting that long I stated hey XXXX, I'm going to file a consumer financial protection bureau complaint now based on you leaving me on hold for almost 11 minutes with your mute button and not coming back to check in one time. Sure enough. As soon as I said that here he is responding. What do you know?. I established he had not verified my account 11 minutes later and it took him almost a full 11 minutes from that point before the account was actually verified. I tried to establish why he didn't verify the account in the extensive amount of time he had me holding with the mute button pressed. He refused to answer. When he transferred the call to a XXXX earlier, he refused to give her name. XXXX stated that he can give the people 's names and he had no reason to tell me differently. He refused to give the names once again tonight and after 32 minutes I finally got on the phone with a XXXX who I asked to file a complaint against XXXX for his behaviors and wasting my time and refusing to provide people 's names on multiple occasions and placing people on hold for 11 minutes at a time with the mute button and never checking in. I asked him to please provide me the case ID when this was done and I would politely wait. That never happened. XXXX seemed confused and wanted to play stupid even though I outlined exactly what I needed his help with when the account had now been verified three times in the last hour.. the call disconnected. XXXX never called me back. I have no case ID. There's nothing to show that XXXX had anything filed against him and he essentially wasted over 32 minutes of my time before a quote '' manager from call center hopped on the phone. 

This is truly unacceptable and beyond a waste of my time.

2024-11-30,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Other transaction problem,,"ISSUE DESCRIPTION On the morning of XX/XX/year>, I joined XXXX XXXX XXXX, opened a savings account, and deposited funds. Following this, I connected my new savings account to my almost decade-old Coinbase account through XXXX and initiated a deposit and a buy order. Immediately upon submitting the transaction, a window appeared stating, "" Buy Services Disabled. '' ISSUE RESOLUTION ATTEMPTS Coinbase Chat Support : I initiated a chat with Coinbase support, waiting approximately 4 hours to connect with a live agent, XXXX. 

XXXX informed me that my account was "" under review '' but refused to provide a specific reason for the restriction. Instead, I would receive an email update within 1-3 business days.

When I asked under what circumstances Coinbase would not lift the restrictions and what actions I could take to restore full functionality, XXXX vaguely mentioned that they may request additional documents to confirm my account. However, she did not specify what documents or provide clear instructions. 

XXXX also emphasized that the restriction was due to "" security reasons. '' Despite this, other features of my account, such as deposits, sales, and withdrawals, remained fully functional. This contradiction raised serious concerns about the rationale for restricting only the buying feature if my account was genuinely "" under review '' for security reasons. 

When I continued to press XXXX for specific details and actionable steps, she abruptly ended the chat. 

Coinbase does not persist chat records, meaning all details of my conversation with XXXX were lost when she closed the chat. 

Coinbase Phone Support : Concurrently, I used Coinbase 's "" request a call '' feature for phone support. 
I was placed on hold for an additional 5 hours and ultimately never received a response. 

COINBASE 'S FOLLOW-UP EMAIL : On the morning of XX/XX/year>, I received an email from Coinbase, which read as follows : "" Hi [ Name ], We have completed your account review, and buy/deposit services remain disabled at this time. 

You are still able to send/sell and withdraw any cryptocurrency you currently have on Coinbase and withdraw funds to your existing payment method.

As a trusted crypto exchange, we take a number of steps to keep all accounts safe, and we regularly monitor customer accounts to ensure compliance with our terms of service. For security reasons, we're not able to provide you with any additional information at this time. If you need support with the enabled services on your account, please reach out to Coinbase Support. 

Regards, The Coinbase team '' Despite claiming to have "" completed '' the review, Coinbase : - Provided no actionable steps or recourse to restore my accounts buying functionality. 
- Failed to request the "" additional documents '' XXXX mentioned in the chat. 
- Refused to disclose the specific reason for the restriction, again citing vague "" security reasons. '' Note that Coinbase sent this email at XXXXXXXX XXXX in the middle of the night, all but guaranteeing I wouldn't see the email for several hours and delaying my response. 

UNREASONABLE, CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS Coinbases actions contradict themselves and lack transparency. If they genuinely placed my account "" under review '' for "" security reasons, '' it is illogical and inconsistent to restrict buying and deposit services while still allowing other functions, such as withdrawals, sales, and deposits of cryptocurrency. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of Coinbase 's rationale and raises serious concerns about their practices. 

COINBASE 'S CASE HANDLING ISSUES 1. Lack of Transparency : Coinbase failed to provide specific reasons for the restriction, actionable steps to resolve it, or clear communication about the circumstances under which restrictions would remain. 
2. Unreasonable Wait Times : I experienced 4 hours of waiting for chat support and 5 hours on hold for phone support, neither of which resulted in a resolution. 
XXXX. Failure to Provide Recourse : XXXX mentioned the possibility of requesting additional documents, yet the follow-up email contained no such request or path to restoring account functionality. 
XXXX. Lack of Persisted Records : Coinbases failure to retain chat records resulted in the loss of critical information from my conversation with XXXX. 
XXXX. Contradictory Policy Implementation : Restricting buying services while leaving other features operational is inconsistent and raises questions about the validity of the "" security reasons '' justification. 

REQUESTED RESOLUTION I demand the following : XXXX. A specific and immediate explanation for why my account was restricted. 
2. Clear, actionable steps to restore full functionality to my account.

After providing PayPal with all the information in the dispute, including communications, tracking number and more, the case was closed in the sellers favor after almost 2 months of waiting. The reason for the closure in the sellers favor was that I provided tracking info that couldn't be validated but l used the shipping label that the seller themselves gave me and they also confirmed the receiving the item. I've attached proof below that the seller is the one who sent me the shipping label. The tracking number for the return label is XXXX. So not only does the seller have the item, they are keeping my money hostage and will not return it. I've contacted the shipping company directly and they have confirmed to me as well that the item was delivered to the correct address on the shipping label, that was giving to me by the merchant. I've attached written proof from XXXX themselves showing this. 

After speaking with multiple customer service representatives on the phone using PayPals support number, they recognized that the case shouldve been closed in my favor but reopened the case under a different case type. The case was closed again. I once again spoke to customer service who changed it to the correct case type and it was closed again within minutes to sellers favor because I waited over 30 days.

So again to clarify I provided the following to PayPal Proof that the seller confirmed they received the item Proof that the seller is the one who provided the shipping label for return The actual shipping label itself given to me by the seller via email Proof of delivery by XXXX showing it was delivered to the seller Multiple communications with the seller stating that they will refund me but they never have This is clearly fraudulent business practices on both the seller 's part as well as PayPal 's. This is a case of neither party- the seller or PayPal- abiding by their own refund and protections as listed on their respective websites.

2024-11-30,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"Explanation of My Complaint : Recently, XXXX has begun drastically reducing credit limits for many cardholders, including myself, with little to no explanation or prior notice. On XX/XX/year>, I discovered that my XXXX credit limit had been slashed from {$32000.00} to {$5000.00} without any warning. I was not notified in advance, and the only communication I received was a vague email dated XX/XX/year>, citing a "" periodic review '' as the reason for the reduction. 
This reduction had an immediate and detrimental impact : My credit utilization spiked from under 10 % to over 50 %, harming my credit score despite my responsible usage and perfect payment history. 
The change disrupted my ability to manage routine expenses, as my card was unexpectedly declined for a grocery order, stranding my family mid-transaction. 
Why This Is Unfair : Lack of Notice : I was not given advance warning or a clear opportunity to address any perceived risk factors. 
Arbitrary and Unexplained : The reasons provided, such as "" periodic review, '' lack transparency and do not align with my financial behavior or payment history. 
Severe Financial Harm : The abrupt reduction caused unnecessary stress, credit score damage, and disruptions to essential transactions, like groceries or subscriptions. 
Desired Resolution : A complete investigation into XXXX practices, including their lack of transparency and failure to notify customers adequately. 
Restitution for affected customers, such as reinstatement of previous credit limits or compensation for credit score damage. 
Improved communication policies to ensure that customers are warned and given a chance to address concerns before such drastic actions are taken. 
This situation undermines trust in credit card issuers and highlights the need for accountability when companies make sweeping changes that harm their customers.

The product was marketed as beginner-friendly, but it was not understandable for a new trader like myself, which goes against the advertised promise. Despite providing substantial evidence of misleading advertising and poor-quality service, my bank has denied my claim, leaving me with no recourse. I believe this decision is unjust and warrants review, particularly in light of the companys own refund policy and the additional admission that further training was required. 

1. Initial Purchase and Misleading Advertising : I purchased a fXXXX XXXX XXXX  from XXXX which was advertised as beginner-friendly. The FAQ section on the companys website clearly states : Is This Okay for Beginners? 
Yes, new and seasoned traders are welcomed. 

However, upon starting the program, I found that the material was far too advanced and provided no foundational instruction for beginners. The videos were disorganized and lacked in-depth explanations of key concepts such as liquidity, which were essential for understanding the material. 
2. Request for Refund and Denial from Merchant : Upon realizing that the bootcamp did not meet the advertised standard for beginners, I requested a refund from the company. Instead of granting the refund, they offered me an additional mentorship course valued at {$990.00}, stating : I am willing to place you in my mentorship coursedesigned for beginners for 60 days and the bootcamp will make sense to you after. 

This statement clearly implies that the bootcamp I initially purchased was not suitable for beginners as advertised. The companys attempt to sell me an additional course to clarify material that was supposed to be understandable from the start is an admission that their product did not align with its original claims. 
3. Refund Policy : The companys refund policy is restrictive and only offers refunds within 24 hours for technical issues, such as problems downloading the content or damaged files : Refund Policy : We understand that sometimes purchases may not meet your expectationsallows for a full refund within 24 hours of purchase date under the following conditions : item damaged, issues with downloading, not loading, etc. 

However, I am requesting a refund based on misleading advertising, which was not addressed in their refund policy. I should not be held to this restrictive refund window when the product fundamentally did not meet the expectations set by the advertising. 
4. Chargeback Request with Current Bank After being denied a refund by the merchant, I filed a chargeback request with [ Current Bank ], providing the above evidence, including : Screenshots of the misleading advertising on the merchants website. 
Email communication where the merchant indirectly admits the bootcamp was not suitable for beginners. 
A copy of the refund policy showing the restrictive nature of the refund process. 
Despite providing clear evidence of false advertising and a legitimate basis for a refund, [ Your Banks Name ] denied my chargeback request, leaving me with no recourse to recover my funds.

Reasons Why the Chargeback Should Be Approved : 1. Misleading Advertising : The product was advertised as being suitable for beginners, but it clearly was not. The merchant themselves admitted that I needed additional training to understand the content ( email correspondence attached ), which constitutes deceptive advertising.

2. Unjust Denial Based on Limited Refund Policy : The merchants restrictive refund policy does not cover situations involving misleading advertising, which is a clear consumer protection issue. I believe the bank should have taken this into account when reviewing my chargeback request.

3. Failure to Uphold Consumer Rights : Current Bank has failed to uphold my consumer rights by siding with the merchant despite the overwhelming evidence of a misrepresented product and refusal to grant a fair refund. Chargebacks are meant to protect consumers from situations exactly like this, and the denial of my claim is both unjust and contrary to these protections.",,FinCo Services Inc DBA Current,TX,75071,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10975056

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Notice of Dispute and Intent to File Arbitration Inclusion of Dismissed XXXX Dear LexisNexis Consumer Center, I am writing to formally dispute the inclusion of two XXXX records in my LexisNexis consumer report. These records are misleading, potentially inaccurate, and violate my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The details of the disputed XXXX  are as follows : XXXX  Filing Number : XXXX Filing Date : XX/XX/XXXX Disposition : Dismissed Disposition Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Filing Number : XXXX Filing Date : XX/XX/XXXX Disposition : Dismissed Disposition Date : XX/XX/XXXX Reasons for Dispute : Dismissed XXXX Are Misleading : Both XXXX cases were dismissed, meaning there was no discharge of debts or continuation of proceedings. Including these records in my report without proper context misrepresents my financial status and negatively impacts my creditworthiness. 
Accuracy of Reporting : Under FCRA ( 607 ( b ) ), LexisNexis must ensure maximum possible accuracy in reporting consumer information. Reporting dismissed XXXX without adequate explanation or justification fails to meet this standard.

Permissible Purpose and Disclosure : If this information was disclosed to third parties without my explicit consent or a permissible purpose as required by FCRA ( 604 ), this constitutes a violation of my rights. 
Emotional Distress and Harm : The continued inclusion of inaccurate and misleading information has caused me significant emotional distress, as well as harm to my financial and professional reputation. 
XXXXexisNexiss Legal History : I am aware of the Class Action Lawsuit ( 2017 ), in which LexisNexis Risk Solutions was accused of reporting inaccurate XXXX details in credit reports. Plaintiffs alleged that LexisNexis reported incorrect XXXX  statuses, adversely affecting their creditworthiness. This demonstrates a pattern of inadequate practices in reporting XXXX data, further supporting my claim that my consumer report contains similar inaccuracies.

Requested Actions : Verification : Provide documentation verifying the accuracy and legality of including these dismissed XXXX in my report.

Correction/Removal : If you can not verify the accuracy and appropriateness of including these records, promptly remove them from my report.

Compensation : I am seeking {$5000.00} to resolve this matter due to the violations of my rights under FCRA and the emotional distress caused by the inaccurate reporting.

Disclosure of Recipients : Provide a list of all third parties who have accessed my consumer report containing the disputed information.

Intent to File Arbitration : If LexisNexis fails to resolve this matter within the 30 days allotted under the FCRA or refuses to remove these inaccurate entries and provide compensation, I will pursue arbitration under the terms of your service agreement.

I am aware that arbitration proceedings will cost LexisNexis significantly more than {$5000.00}, including lawyer fees, arbitration filing costs, and other related expenses. Resolving this matter promptly and fairly would be a more cost-effective and equitable solution for all parties involved.

Preferred Communication Method : I request that all correspondence related to this matter be sent to me via email at XXXX or by mail to my address listed above. I will not communicate over the phone, as I prefer to have everything in writing for my records. 

This Is Not a Joke : Please understand that I take this matter very seriously, and I expect LexisNexis to do the same. Any further delays or failure to address this dispute appropriately will result in legal action, including arbitration. 

Supporting Documentation : I have included the following to assist your investigation : A copy of my LexisNexis report with the disputed XXXX  highlighted. 
A copy of my government-issued ID for verification purposes. 

Please respond in writing within 30 days, as required by law, to confirm the resolution of this matter or provide evidence supporting the continued inclusion of these records. Failure to act promptly will leave me no choice but to escalate this matter to arbitration. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this dispute.",,LEXISNEXIS,NY,11434,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10974803

2024-11-30,Credit card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"XX/XX/year> : I realized my {$200.00} XXXX auto payment ( minimum payment due {$63.00} ) was split out significantly and Home Depot applied portions to separate charges that were not due. 

The balance due on my revolving ( interest ) was {$120.00}. They only applied {$62.00} to this balance and charged interest the the remaining amount ( for the XXXX month ). They applied the remaining payment portion of {$130.00} to charges that were not due until XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I called and spoke with manager at customer support, I was told they will not/ can not apply my payment to the revolving even if I request it. Their 'system ' spits payments to balances due up to 2 months 'before "" the due date and there is nothing I can do about that. At this point, I don't know how I can eliminate my revolving balance 100 % quickly based on how they apply my payment, except to pay 2 months early on my other balance -- which I do not want to do. 

According to what I read under the Credit Card Act, "" Credit card companies must apply payment amounts "" in excess of the minimum payment amount '' to a consumer 's highest interest rate balances first. '' This would be my revolving credit portion of the account. Why are they not doing that? 

I mentioned this to the customer service manager and he said they are applying them according to their terms and could not change it. I've been a cardholder with Home Depot for years, and have never had this experience. I'm wondering if their 'terms ' have changed in the fine print.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",OR,97526,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10979545

2024-11-30,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Credit denial,"It has come to my attention that I have recently been discriminated against and my application for credits for a used vehicle were denied XXXX. My denial letter is proof of this discrimination. As a federally protected consumer, this is a direct violation of my consumer rights ; potential securities fraud. The moment I applied I chose to become an investor which means any person or entity that owns an obligation issued by an issuing entity. The application itself is considered a financial asset and security and I have not been given any equal consideration for my application for credits even though USAA has ran my personal information and credit history, and has accepted the application which creates and opens an account whether or not the credits Im applying for are given to me. The credit application is the asset provided to create collateral for the extension of credit. Credit can never be issued without collateral. Securities are to be received by the trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the obligor arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, appearance, or obligation. The Securities Exchange Act under lawful extension of credit, it states that it is unlawful to maintain or extend credit TO OR FOR any customer without collateral or on any other collateral securities. According to the filings listed with the SEC, USAA XXXX XXXX ; USAA Auto Owner Trust are responsible for securitizing and collateralizing the notes that USAA Federal Savings bank purchases. Pledging my credit application to create a security along with a collateral certificate and trying to assign the debt to me in the form of a loan is securities fraud. 

USAA has no right to deny me of an extension of credit when they are not lawfully allowed to give consumers loans nor having disclosed the fact you are only purchasing the underlying security and selling in on the secondary market. The underwriters initial propose is to offer the notes directly to the public at the public offering prices set forth on the cover page of the prospectus supplement for USAA and may offer the notes to certain dealers. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in house and third party sales forces, and direct response advertising. The online application is a product/instrument in which USAA has already been compensated for. In addition, in the ordinary course of USAAs business activities, the underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities ( or related derivative securities ) and financial instruments ( including bank loans ) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of yours or your affiliates. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/ or short positions in such securities and instruments. Underwriters are actively trading debt securities or other financial instruments such loans and credit agreements.

You are required by law to provide these disclosures through an ABS-15G form with the SEC which requires asset backed securitizers to provide disclosures regarding fulfilled and unfulfilled repurchase request with respect to asset backed securities. The Terms of Notes detail the obligations and duties of the trust indentured. It states the company may from time to time, subject to compliance with any other applicable provisions of the indentured but with the consent of the holders of notes, create and issue pursuant to the indenture an unlimited principal amount of additional notes ( in excess of any amounts therefore issued ) having the same terms and conditions to those of the other outstanding notes, except that any such additional notes ( I ) may have have a different issue date and issue price from other outstanding notes and ( II ) may have a different amount of interest payable on the first interest payment date after issuance that is payable on other outstanding notes. Such additional notes shall constitute part of the same series of notes as the notes initially issued here under. Not only is USAA not providing me the credits I applied for, and selling my securities, but have the ability to sell the security multiple times for multiple values without giving me any of the security interest in return from my investment.

If compliance with your most recent SEC filings is not honored I will be forced to contact the SEC for violation your agreement. It seems USAA knoeingky intended to decieve me and I need this matter to be corrected. The adverse action that has taken place on my application needs to be reversed as it does not coincide with the disclosures provided to me or the Trust Indentured agreement on file with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,FL,33138,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978187

2024-11-30,Debt collection,Telecommunications debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I am filing a formal complaint against Transworld Systems Inc. ( TSI ) for their failure to provide the required debt validation and their improper collection practices regarding an alleged debt they claim I owe to XXXX XXXX. Below are the details of the situation : Debt Collection Information : Collection Agency : Transworld Systems Inc. 
Reference/Account Number : XXXX Date of Initial Correspondence : XX/XX/XXXX Amount Allegedly Owed : {$1000.00} ( discrepancy noted below ) Summary of Issue : On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a communication from Transworld Systems Inc. attempting to collect a debt of {$1000.00} related to XXXX XXXX XXXX However, the amount stated in their letter does not match the amount shown on the statements they provided, which is {$900.00}. The difference of {$110.00} has not been explained or documented. 

I would like to make it clear that I do not owe any money to XXXX XXXX. I have no outstanding debt with them, and I have never been informed by XXXX XXXX that I owe anything. Furthermore, I am receiving multiple communications from various debt collectors regarding this same alleged debt, which has created confusion and concern regarding the legitimacy of the claim. 

Despite my request for debt validation, Transworld Systems Inc. responded by sending me multiple copies of the same monthly statement, but they did not provide the required documentation to verify the debt, including : Proof of the debt, including an itemized breakdown of all charges, fees, and interest. 
Documentation establishing that I am responsible for this debt. 
The name and address of the original creditor ( XXXX XXXX ). 
Evidence that the debt is correctly linked to my personal information. 
I have not received the necessary documentation within the required time frame, and Transworld Systems Inc. has failed to address the discrepancy between the amount owed and the amounts listed in the statements. 

Requested Resolution : I request that Transworld Systems Inc. provide the following : A full, itemized breakdown of the alleged debt, including all charges, interest, and fees.

Proof of the debt, including documentation that I am legally responsible for this debt.

The name and address of the original creditor.

Proper validation of the debt, including confirmation that the debt is correctly linked to my personal information.

Immediate correction of any inaccuracies on my credit report that may have been caused by unverified reporting of this debt. 
Cease all further collection efforts on this debt until proper documentation is provided.

Immediate correction of any false or inaccurate reports made by Transworld Systems Inc. to any credit reporting agency or third-party debt collectors regarding this alleged debt.

If Transworld Systems Inc. is unable or unwilling to provide the necessary validation and explanation of the debt, I ask that they cease collection activity and remove any false or inaccurate reports to credit bureaus regarding this alleged debt.

Additionally, I request that the CFPB investigate whether Transworld Systems Inc. and other debt collectors involved are violating federal law under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by making multiple attempts to collect the same debt from me, which may be the result of improper handling of this alleged debt. 

Additional Information : I have sent a letter directly to Transworld Systems Inc. on [ Date ], requesting the appropriate documentation, and have also forwarded a copy of my complaint to the Texas Attorney Generals Office and Transworld Systems Inc., urging them to resolve the matter in accordance with the law.

Please assist me in resolving this issue by ensuring that Transworld Systems Inc. complies with all applicable laws, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

This is completely unacceptable! I have had some of these accounts established for over 15Yrs! This was some computer algorithm generating account closures with no review or understanding of impact on my credit file. Loosing this amount of avialble credit along with accounts that had substantial age has negatively impacted my credit score and has made a major impact on my buying power as a consumer. The termination of my Care Credit account has impacted my families health as this card was use to help offset medical procedure expenses and we have now had to delay two planned procedures due to the loss of the $ XXXX in available credit line. As a consumer my purchasing power has been severely impacted due to the sheer trade accounts financing managed by this company. All these accounts also had SCRA protections, that I will not qualify for on a new trade account if reopened with the creditor as the customer service rep suggested on there chat service, multiple chat reps told me to just re-apply for the accounts, they should be approved as this happens all the time??? 

The following accounts were closed although I have no history of missed payments, have not exceeded the credit lines, typically pay more than the minimum due, and on several of these accounts received credit line increases just weeks before they were closed without notice or reason : Ashley Furniture ( $ XXXX credit Limit ), Lowe 's ( $ XXXX Limit ), XXXX XXXX XXXX ( $ XXXX ), Care Credit $ XXXX Limit ), Dicks Sporting Goods ( $ XXXX ), PayPal MasterCard ( $ XXXX Limit ), Sam 's Club Mastercard ( $ XXXX Limit ), Amazon ( $ XXXX Limit ), Discount Tires ( $ XXXX Limit ). The accounts were all current, with impeccable payment/usage history and none of them were over 50 % utilization! 

This was a blanket action due to some perceived internal risk caused by my accounts. No credit report info was provided on the letters so I assume my credit file was not even a factor in this action. I don't know because I can not get a straight answer from the creditor on the real reason the accounts were closed. I have a ill feeling they were closed because they had SCRA protection on them with a lower APR than I would be able to received on a new line of credit opened with them today... 


I have provided one account number for my Lowe 's account. I can provide additional account numbers but your system would only allow one. I do not want to open separate complaints for each account as all of them are managed by the same company, which should be looked into also, this is a lot of stores and brands represented by this one company who took adverse action against me for no reason across all the the brands they represent!

2024-11-30,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"My partner passed away 4 years ago from XXXX XXXX. We were joint tenants in common and both on the deed of our home, with a transfer on death clause where the property passed solely to me when she passed. We held auto titles, bank accounts, and bills jointly. We were not married. We had a will created by a lawyer that stated the home was to pass to me and that her intention was for me to be able to continue to manage the mortgage after she passed away. The mortgage is only in her name due to the advice of the lender to not include me due to not having enough credit built up when we originally bought the house. Prior to my partner passing away, we went to the bank to sign paperwork to allow me to be able to continue to talk with the bank about the loan and they stated that I would become the successor in interest after she passed, so I thought that this was taken care of. After she passed, I submitted the death certificate to the bank and they stated I could continue to pay the mortgage off until it is paid off, which I have been doing without issue since that time. 

Within the last month, I received mail to our address that stated that because there was a discrepancy between the name listed on the mortgage ( her name ) and the name on the home owner 's insurance policy ( her name ), that they wouldn't be able to accept the payment for the home owner 's insurance, which is a problem because you have to have this in order to have a mortgage. They wouldn't provide me with any information about the mortgage on my house when I called other than I needed to apply to become a successor in interest. They stated that my options were to refinance, assume the loan, or become successor in interest. They stated that they needed evidence of my relationship to my partner and then said that they could see on the death certificate that I was listed as her partner because I was present at the time of her death and that this could be used as evidence. The person I spoke with said the death certificate wouldn't need to be submitted again because it was submitted shortly to Chase after my partner 's death. The person I spoke with said that likely the issue was that my partner 's name was removed from the home insurance ( XXXX ) and they triggered an audit. The person I spoke with said that if I could add her name or her estate to the home insurance policy it would resolve things. On the directions of this paperwork, it stated that joint tenants in common were eligible to become successors in interest, so again I assumed that it was okay. I contacted my home insurance company, who stated that they were not able to add my deceased partner 's name back on the home insurance policy, and that Chase also was not providing them with any information or accepting the paperwork. 

After submitting the paperwork at Chase bank, I then called the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a few days later. I was told that my request was denied but that this was due to a clerical error because the death certificate was not included with the packet I submitted of the old deed, new deed, and transfer on death affidavit and that it should be approved. I received mail from Chase over that weekend that stated that my request was denied. I called the Chase XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX on Tuesday XX/XX/24 and was told that I would not be able to be successor in interest because my partner and I were not married. I was told that forced home insurance would be placed on my home because Chase couldn't accept the home insurance policy and that this would be more expensive. I was told that I wasn't allowed to know how much it would be or when it would start. I was told that I could either try to assume the loan or refinance but that none of this was guaranteed and that the mortgage interest rates were higher at this point in time than when we got our home and that there would be closing fees I would have to pay. I informed the bank that this XXXX force me out of my home depending on how much it is. I was also told that to be able to know more information about the mortgage I would need to file the will in court, become executor of the will, and then they would be able to provide me with more information. I was also told that even if I became executor, this would only work for XXXX years and that I would have to assume or refinance the loan. 

I contacted my lawyer who had created the will and he informed me that since we had no assets to distribute from the will ( everything was a jointly held asset and did not go through probate ) that we would not be able to file the will in court just for me to be able to communicate with the bank. I checked my email and saw that my home insurance company emailed that they were able to renew the home insurance policy and that the payment went through. They also added my partner 's name back to the home insurance policy. I called the Chase mortgage life events team back and the Chase home insurance team to ask about how to submit this update to the home insurance policy. The person I spoke with said that if I submitted this I could trigger a further audit and that I may be okay for this year with this issue, but likely next year I could face forced home insurance, and that it may still even happen this year. She stated that adding my partner 's name to the policy would not fix things. She couldn't fully confirm anything for me because I was not approved as the successor in interest. At this point I am overwhelmed and a nervous wreck and need assistance with this issue because I am not allowed to find out information with any certainty about my loan or continue to pay the loan as we planned for. I am not even able to be told the correct loan number for the loan. I am not able to pay my mortgage if I refinance and the interest rate goes up or more expensive forced home insurance goes on the loan. I feel that I am being forced out of my home and treated like a criminal when I call Chase and just want to be able to continue to make the mortgage payments as is and live in the home, as it is my primary residence. I am afraid that even by filing a complaint the further review will involve retaliation from Chase and them placing forced home owner insurance on my home sooner than planned.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,OH,43219,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10980248

1. Timeline of Events - Returned Payments In XX/XX/year>, two auto payments on my Shell MasterCard were returned because an auto-pay setting did not reflect the current balance ; this was not due to missed payments. I have consistently made my payments on time and in full. 

- Fraud Claim : In XX/XX/year>, I reported digital unauthorized charges on my account - Account Closure : Following the report of these fraudulent charges, my Shell MasterCard account was closed in XX/XX/year>, allegedly due to the previously returned payments. 

2. Issues Faced- I have been informed that I can not reapply for a new Shell MasterCard account, despite my solid payment history prior to these events. 
- Upon contacting the Shell MasterCard executive office, I spoke with the person handling my case, who informed me that my account was being closed and made a statement regarding racial discrimination. When I requested to speak to her supervisor, she claimed she didnt have one. 
- After following up with the executive office, I was informed that she did, in fact, have a supervisor and that my case would be assigned to another representative. 

3. Dispute Over Fraudulent Charges - Despite identifying fraudulent charges on my account, I have encountered ongoing billing issues related to these charges, which has further exacerbated my financial distress. 

Consumer Laws Involved - I am aware of my rights under various consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). I urge Shell MasterCard to comply with these laws when addressing my case. 

I respectfully request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to investigate my complaint against Shell MasterCard and scrutinize their practices regarding my situation, particularly in relation to account management and the consequences of identity theft.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,90247,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10973177

2024-11-30,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  I went to PNC to conduct some business : deposit a number of checks ( pension, rental checks ). And, to make a withdrawal during this transaction. As usual, I provided my Driver License. It was accepted as it ALWAYS is. The teller made one transaction then I was asked for a 2nd form of ID. I questioned the need for a 2nd form of ID as I have been banking here for decades & a DL was the accepted mode necessary. I was told 2 forms of ID were necessary. I requested to speak w/the manager as I needed to know what changed & why. I was directed to speak to the manager. 
We had a conversation & I was told it was a fairly 'new ' protocol. W/this managers assistance I completed all my business : deposits & withdrawal using my DL. I went home & relayed my experience to my family member, stating they wld need 2 forms of ID. They were quizzical. I have not been back to PNC since XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I called what I thought was their corporate number ( XXXX ) to get info re this issue : if the policy changed, was it implemented in all stores for all customers, if it changed why weren't customers informed. I was given the run-around. I was advised the number was for customer care & someone wld call me back in 3 bizness days. I expressly stated I wanted to escalate this up. ( I called on XXXX XXXX bc I wanted to go to PNC & conduct business but was not tolerating more issues as it relates. I wanted to get clarity before I returned to conduct business @ PNC ) On XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX a rep from PNC returned my call. It was NOT corporate as I had requested. It was customer care who was kind, professional but cld NOT explain what took place, why & if it were across the board. I was told my concerns were noted. And, that 2 forms of ID were required. I told the rep 'No, I've banked here a very long time & my valid DL had been sufficient ) ( My concerns were not addressed ). 

In the last 3 weeks, a family member w/PNC accounts has gone to the same PNC three ( 3 ) times & the only ID she needed to show was the 1 ID, her DL. Three times she has gone since my experience on XXXX XXXX XXXX. It shld be stated I have more accounts than she does at PNC yet I was told I needed 2 forms of ID. I do not have an ATM or Debit card. Why is this so called policy unfairly applied? If there is now a requirement of 2 forms of ID : why were customers not told? Clearly, it is not applied fairly or my decades long requirement of a photo DL wld suffice. I'm filing this complaint bc PNC has failed to give me an adequate response. AND, bc my family member has gone 3 times since my experience & 1 form of ID ( a DL ) was sufficient. 
When talking to customer care on XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, they stated 2 forms of ID is required. I challenged that & stated NO, it absolutely is not. I've been banking at PNC before it became PNC. It was XXXX XXXX XXXX. And, my DL has been sufficient for decades. 

I was going to file a complaint months ago when I went to another PNC, deposited over {$7000.00} in funds ( pension, rent checks ) & wanted {$1300.00} back. I was asked for another form of ID then ... .I didn't even answer. Because if you can take {$7000.00} to deposit using my ONE ID ( DL ) then surely they can withdraw {$1300.00} from those funds. On that date, I conducted my business & left. ( I don't regularly use that PNC so I let is slide ).

Consequently, I opened a new company in New Jersey and a new bank account ( account number XXXX ) where I deposited the check. According to IRS guidelines, XXXX is available for closed companies as well. However, this account was subsequently closed by Chase 's fraud team. 

I have submitted all necessary documents to verify both my old company 's information and my own.

Upon my second call, I was instructed to change the address on the account since it differed from the one on the check. I complied and paid {$300.00} for the address change, but the account was still not released even the representative promised. As a result, I had to create another new account ( account number XXXX ). 
Chase wants me to call IRS to verify the check and the company but it is impossible to contact them as you know. This sounds incredibly frustrating. Trying to reach the IRS can feel like an endless maze.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Misrepresentation and Inaccuracies in Credit Report Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to formally address the ongoing inaccuracies and misrepresentation of information in my Experian credit report ( Report Number : XXXX, Date Generated : XX/XX/XXXX ). Despite my multiple efforts to request an investigation and reinvestigation into these inaccuracies, specifically concerning the XXXX XXXX  account ( Account Number : XXXX ), Experian has failed to comply with its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( i ). 

Background I have notified Experian on several occasions about the discrepancies in the reporting of the payment history associated with this account. For instance : Experian reports late payments starting in XXXX, while XXXX reports late payments beginning in XXXX. 
This discrepancy alone demonstrates that the information is not 100 % accurate as mandated by FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681. Furthermore, Experian has neither provided proof of a proper investigation nor the documentation used to validate its findings, which constitutes a breach of their legal obligations.

Legal Basis for My Complaint Under FCRA, Experian is required to ensure that all information reported is accurate and complete : FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( i ) : Consumer reporting agencies must conduct a reasonable investigation of disputed information. If they can not verify the accuracy of the information, it must be corrected or deleted within 30 days. 
Definition of Investigative Consumer Report ( 15 U.S.C. 1681a ) : An investigative consumer report requires the gathering of information through personal interviews or reliable sources. Experian has not provided evidence of any such effort.

Misrepresentation and Consumer Protection : Misrepresentation, incomplete reporting, or deceptive practices by credit reporting agencies violate consumer rights. Courts have held agencies liable for such violations, as evidenced in cases like XXXX v. Experian ( XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  ( XXXX ). 
Specific Issues with Experians Handling of My Case Failure to Investigate Properly : Experian claims my account was verified as accurate, yet the discrepancies between their report and other credit agencies remain unaddressed. No documentation proving their investigation has been shared with me, despite my explicit request. 

Inaccurate Reporting : The payment history of this account remains inconsistent with other credit agencies, violating the FCRAs requirement for 100 % accuracy. 

Continuous Misrepresentation : Experians actionsor lack thereofconstitute a misrepresentation of my financial standing, which has caused me harm by impairing my ability to secure credit. 

Request for Resolution I demand the immediate deletion of the XXXX XXXX  account ( XXXX ) from my Experian credit report for the following reasons : Experian has failed to provide documentation proving the validity of its findings, including : Details of the investigation process. 
Names and employee numbers of individuals who validated the account information. 
Supporting documents or records used to validate the account. 
Experian has not corrected or deleted the inaccurate and incomplete information within the legally mandated 30-day period. 

If Experian can not provide the requested evidence to substantiate their findings, they must remove the account immediately to comply with FCRA provisions. 

Conclusion I urge the CFPB to intervene in this matter and hold Experian accountable for its failure to comply with federal laws. Experians actions reflect a violation of my consumer rights through false, misleading, and deceptive practices. If Experian continues to neglect its obligations, I am prepared to escalate this matter further to ensure compliance and seek additional remedies.

I was unaware that each card had a {$75.00} and {$120.00} annual fee. XXXX approved these cards in XX/XX/year>. 

Since that time, I have never used the cards, and I do not want them. Since their approval, there has been no minimum balance due and no payments made. 

However, now, it appears that the credit card company is charging interest on these fees, and still the statement reflects the {$0.00} minimum payment due. 

I am not interested in these cards due to the lack of clear information about the fees. The limits are so low that the annual fees consume about XXXX of the credit line. Additionally, this credit card company is not as well-known as XXXX or XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX makes it difficult to reach customer service as their telephone customer assistance line apparently has few English-speaking agents, making communication impossible. The company does not offer an electronic method of contact such as email or customer service chat. The sole alternative is to send a letter to a XXXX address, a lengthy process that lacks verification of receipt or action. 

I am not asking for free money. I merely request the release from these credit cards with no derogatory marks on my credit history, as they remain unactivated and unutilizeda zero balance, in excellent standing, closed at the request of the borrower.",,"CLGF Holdco 1, LLC",KS,660XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-02,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,10980188

I do not recall authorizing Discover Financial Services to conduct a credit inquiry, nor do I have any existing business relationship or credit application with your institution that would justify this inquiry.

Violation of FCRA 1681b Under the FCRA, a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer report includes : A credit transaction initiated by the consumer. 
A firm offer of credit or insurance. 
The consumer 's written consent. 
A legitimate business need in connection with a transaction initiated by the consumer. 
Since I did not initiate a transaction, apply for credit, or authorize this inquiry, it appears that this credit inquiry was conducted without a permissible purpose, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b.

Request for Resolution I request that you : Provide evidence of the permissible purpose that justifies this inquiry, including any written authorization I may have provided. 
Remove the inquiry from my credit report if no such evidence exists. 
Provide written confirmation of the steps you have taken to address this issue.

Specifically, the payment history reflects errors that significantly misrepresent my financial record. 

According to the reports, my XXXX XXXX account indicates that I was 90 days late in XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>. However, the account never accurately reflects a progression of delinquency from 30 days late to 60 days late and then to 90 days late, as required by standard reporting practices. Furthermore, the account was closed due to a transfer to XXXX, yet the misrepresentation persists. 

This reporting error violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ], which mandates that credit reporting agencies and furnishers of credit information must ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. This inaccurate reporting has caused undue harm to my credit profile, and I am demanding immediate rectification of this error. 

Additionally, I am aware of prior lawsuits and complaints against XXXX concerning the misrepresentation of consumers ' accounts and erroneous credit reporting practices. For instance : Case Example : Lawsuits allege XXXX XXXX failure to maintain accurate account records and properly update credit reporting agencies, which mirrors the issues I am currently experiencing. 
Violation Allegation : Misrepresentation of payment history and account status, as in my case, has led to widespread consumer harm, further supporting the need for immediate corrective action. 
I respectfully request the following actions : Immediate Correction : Amend the payment history for the referenced accounts to reflect accurate information.

Verification of Accuracy : Conduct a thorough investigation into the reporting discrepancies and provide a detailed explanation of your findings. 
Notification to Credit Bureaus : Inform all credit reporting agencies of the corrections to ensure my credit profile accurately reflects my account status. 
Please consider this communication a formal complaint under the FCRA. If the requested corrections are not made promptly, I reserve the right to escalate this matter further, including but not limited to seeking legal remedies. 

I trust that you will give this matter the urgent attention it deserves. I expect a written response detailing the steps taken to resolve this issue within 30 days of receiving this letter.

This debt is the result of identity theft, and I am not responsible for it. 

I have taken the following steps to resolve this matter : XXXX. Provided ARS with my FTC Identity Theft Report ( Report Number : XXXX ) and supporting documentation proving that this debt is fraudulent. 
2. Sent a formal cease and desist letter, demanding the cessation of all collection activities and requesting proper debt validation, as required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ).

3. Notified ARS that the debt must be removed from my credit report because it is not valid.

Despite these efforts, ARS continues to pursue collection and has failed to provide adequate validation of this debt.

I am writing in response to your letter dated XX/XX/year>, regarding my complaint filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). Your response, which included a signed agreement and a payment statement, does not fulfill my explicit request for critical information. 

On XX/XX/year>, I sent you a letter requesting specific account details, which remain unaddressed in your response. For clarity, I will reiterate my request : 1. The date of first delinquency for the account.

2. The date of the last payment made on the account.

3. The date of the charge-off.

This information is essential to validate the accuracy of the information reported on my consumer report. As you are aware, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ), the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 ), and Title 18 of the United States Code, you are legally obligated to provide verifiable documentation that substantiates the accuracy of the information being furnished. Failure to provide such documentation constitutes a violation of my consumer rights.

Furthermore, your continued failure to provide the requested information may also implicate Title 18 U.S.C. 1028A, Aggravated Identity Theft, as the lack of validation for the account 's accuracy raises concerns about potential misuse of my personal information.

I reiterate that a signed agreement does not justify or validate what is being reported on my credit file. Validation requires verifiable evidence confirming the specific dates and details requested. Your response has not fulfilled this legal standard, nor does it close this matter.

If you fail to provide the requested information within 10 calendar days of your receipt of this correspondence, I will file a civil suit in good faith to seek damages for your violations of my consumer rights under the aforementioned laws.

Upon initial attempts to access site I was able to gain access and was currently trying to review the information I was looking for when I was rerouted out of the site back to the login screen. I attempted to login again with the same credentials and received an error message with instructions to call a number and I called. After holding I was connected with a woman who ask if I was using a XXXX  browser to login, I answered yes. She wanted me to use XXXX XXXX, so I switched phones to my android phone and proceeded with the XXXX XXXX browser and attempted to login and received the same error message. She wanted my email and to send me a reset link to reset my password for the XXXX account. I had already reset my password for the account before accessing the account previously when I was kicked off of it. During the time I was in the account previously however I had time to dispute XXXX thing in the XXXX report of a credit card I didn't recognize. It shows open but under the other part it said terminated. I don't know what that means for a credit card, but it had no payment info, no balance on it and no information historically. As soon as i was done with the dispute and returned back to the report and began to scroll down it flashed some then it kicked me out of the program. I have not been able to access it since. While on the phone with XXXX I decided to go ahead and ask about the credit card that I was trying to check on originally that was not showing on my credit report I had been instructed to contact the credit bureaus about myself by the credit card company. That is when she told me that she had no information on the credit card and I should call the company back and tell them to report it. From what I have read the credit bureaus are supposed to investigate these things when it is reported to them by a certain amount of time and respond to the consumer of the findings in writing. Either way, I am not the secretary for Goldman Sachs or XXXX, nor am I there for them to waste my time or my money in interest rates and phone calls. I have spent XXXX hours and XXXX minutes on this just this afternoon alone. I have had a credit card from Goldman Sachs since XX/XX/XXXX that has never had a late payment, and I just activated my replacement titanium apple card today for the expiring titanium apple card I received back then. I feel I have been more than patient and polite about this situation. My patients however and southern manners are wearing thin. Quite thin. Not once has my credit card ever been reported to any of the credit bureaus yet. I have documentation in text and email from Goldman Sachs stating XX/XX/XXXX that this would be corrected and sent to the XXXX agencies. Today I was told to contact the agencies myself and tell them to update my credit report because they had sent my account information to the bureaus but it just has not been updated. If I do not pay my bill they would report me. This is clearly something that should be punished. Both to the credit bureaus and to the credit card companies. It affects people 's money and credit worthiness. This is my only credit card for a reason. I do not want more credit cards as I do not need what I can not pay for at the time of purchase in my opinion.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Unable to get your credit report or credit score,Other problem getting your report or credit score,"I am submitting a formal complaint regarding Experian and my inability to access or update my online account. On XX/XX/year>, I sent the following documents to Experian as requested to resolve an issue with my credit report and online account : a copy of my birth certificate, my Social Security card, a state-issued ID, a written statement of my current address, and a bill showing my current address. I was informed by Experian that these documents were necessary because my account was showing as unscorable, and I was unable to access my credit report online. Additionally, my credit report is not reflecting any of my current open accounts and incorrectly indicates that I do not have any open accounts. 

Despite submitting the requested documents over XXXX months ago, as of XX/XX/year>, there has been no update to my account or credit report. I have not received any further instructions or notifications from Experian regarding my submission or account status. This unresolved issue has prevented me from accessing my credit report and monitoring my financial information, which is critical for managing my credit and financial health. The lack of accurate reporting on my open accounts also poses significant challenges in ensuring the completeness and accuracy of my credit profile. 

Based on my research and the situation I have experienced, I believe Experians actionsor lack thereofmay violate several provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically, Experian has failed to investigate and address my submitted documents within the required 30-day timeframe as stipulated under Section 611 of the FCRA. My credit report does not reflect my open accounts or current financial activity, which suggests negligence in maintaining accuracy, a violation of Section 607. Additionally, Experian has failed to respond to my requests to verify and update my credit report, potentially breaching Section 609. Furthermore, Experians lack of action may qualify as an unfair or deceptive act under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus ( CFPB ) guidelines for consumer protection. 

I have contacted Experian customer service on multiple occasions but have not received any meaningful updates or resolution. When I managed to get on the phone with a representative, I was often transferred or told that I had called the wrong number. This process has become increasingly defeating due to the time it takes to even reach someone. The automated service does not allow direct access to a representative and repeatedly forces me to select options that the system is programmed to handle, which do not address my specific issue. It feels unfair to consumers who need to speak with a representative for problems not covered by the automated prompts.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,SC,29073,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10980425

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, IA XXXX Subject : Immediate Removal of Unauthorized Accounts, Names, and Addresses ; Violation of FCRA and Federal Laws To Whom It May Concern, The credit reporting agencies continued refusal to block unauthorized information, despite my clear FTC identity theft report and the Certified UCC Search, constitutes a gross violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), and Identity Theft Protections under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2. Under this law, these agencies are legally bound to block fraudulent or disputed information within four business days, and their failure to do so is not only unlawful but also a willful violation of federal mandates. The idea that the credit reporting agencies would attempt to deny this requeston the grounds of previous disputes or any other rationaleignores the reality that I have never authorized the reporting of these items. This misrepresentation of my creditworthiness has severely impacted my financial opportunities, and their continued inaction constitutes an unacceptable breach of duty. 

In the case of XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), the court emphasized that consumer reporting agencies must immediately correct and block unauthorized information upon notification by the consumer, particularly when fraud or identity theft is involved. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), reaffirms that permissible purposethe basis for reporting informationcannot be assumed but must be explicitly consented to by the consumer. The refusal of these agencies to act in accordance with this precedent is, therefore, not just an error but fraudulent intent designed to perpetuate harm. 

Moreover, 18 U.S.C. 1028A imposes criminal penalties for identity theft, and 18 U.S.C. 894 criminalizes the use of extortionate means to collect or report credit data, which includes the misuse of consumer information for unverified debt reporting. These statutes serve as a deterrent to any effort to deny or delay the removal of fraudulent accounts. If these violations persist, I will immediately escalate this matter, seeking not only civil remedies but also criminal penalties for the companies and reporting agencies involved. Failure to comply with the FTC mandates, FCRA regulations, and the consumer rights afforded under the GLBA exposes these agencies to severe legal consequences. 

There is no legal basis for these agencies to deny my request, and any attempt to do so is a direct violation of my constitutional rights to privacy and to be free from unlawful defamation. The burden of proof is on them to demonstrate that the reported items are valid and that they have received my explicit consent to report these items. As I have already opted out and provided the FTC identity theft report, their failure to block this information constitutes illegal and fraudulent reporting. 



The continued reporting of unauthorized information, despite the irrefutable evidence provided by the UCC search, is not only a direct violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), and Identity Theft Protections but also constitutes a deliberate misrepresentation of my financial standing. This fraudulent reporting is not a mere clerical error ; it is a willful disregard of federal laws that are designed to protect consumers from the very harm I am suffering. The credit reporting agencies actionsor lack thereofare actively undermining my ability to access credit, impacting my financial stability and reputation. Their refusal to comply with clear legal mandates, including the four-day block rule under the FCRA, is an egregious violation that exposes me to irreparable harm. It is both an invasion of my privacy and an abuse of power for which they must be held accountable. Should this matter not be resolved immediately, the consequences will not be limited to the removal of these accounts but will include the pursuit of legal action, financial penalties, and potentially criminal charges under 18 U.S.C. 1028A for identity theft and extortionate collection practices under 18 U.S.C. 894. The willful negligence by the credit bureaus in upholding their obligations is unacceptable, and I demand swift, decisive action to remove all fraudulent accounts, unauthorized information, and misrepresented data from my credit report without delay. 

This formal complaint is submitted in response to the ongoing violation of my consumer rights by Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX. Despite filing an FTC Identity Theft Report, providing a Certified Georgia UCC Search Report, and opting out of any further unauthorized reporting under federal law, the credit reporting agencies have failed to honor their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Their blatant disregard for the law and failure to block unauthorized accounts within the legally mandated four business days has led to severe damage to my financial reputation, and it must be addressed immediately. 

Unauthorized Accounts : The following accounts are being reported on my credit report without my written consent, authorization, or legal justification. These accounts must be removed immediately : XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : {$650.00} Violation : Unauthorized reporting, no validation provided, and no written consent for reporting. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account Number : XXXX Balance : {$670.00} Violation : No validation provided, unauthorized reporting, and HIPAA violation for disclosing private medical information. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) Account Number : XXXX Balance : {$840.00} Violation : Same as above.

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Balance : Related to a previously removed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Violation : Unauthorized reporting, late payment reporting without written consent. 

Unauthorized Addresses : The following addresses are being reported without my consent and must be removed immediately : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX Unauthorized Names : The only name that should be reported on my credit report is XXXX XXXX XXXX. The following unauthorized names must be removed immediately : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Violation of Federal Law : 1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRA Section 604A Section 2 ) : Under this section of the FCRA, consumer reporting agencies may only furnish accounts with explicit written authorization. I have not provided written consent for any of these accounts to be reported on my credit report. This constitutes fraud, misrepresentation of my financial standing, and defamation of character.

2. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( Section 605B ) Failure to Block Fraudulent Information : Once I submitted the FTC Identity Theft Report, the credit reporting agencies were legally obligated to block all disputed and fraudulent information from my report within four business days. They have failed to do so, which is a gross violation of my rights under the FCRA.

3. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ) ( c ) ( Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) : The credit reporting agencies and financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing nonpublic personal information to a third party without my explicit written consent. Their failure to comply with my opt-out request is a direct violation of this law. 
4. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( Accuracy of Reporting ) : Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX are legally required to ensure the accuracy of the information reported. Their failure to block fraudulent accounts, names, and addresses from my credit report is a violation of this obligation. 

Legal Precedents and Supporting Case Law : 1. Pintos v. Pacific Creditors Assn, 605 F.3d 665 ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) : The FCRA mandates that consumer consent be obtained before reporting any information. Unauthorized use of credit information without consumer consent is a violation of federal law. 
2. Harris v. Equifax, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : The failure to remove unauthorized information constitutes a violation of the FCRA. 
3. FTC v. Accusearch Inc., 570 F.3d 1187 ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : The FTC has the authority to enforce actions against entities that engage in unfair or deceptive practices, including unauthorized reporting of consumer information. 

Severe Consequences for Noncompliance : If these unauthorized accounts, addresses, and names are not removed from my credit report within four business days, the following legal actions will be taken : 1. FTC Complaint : I will file a formal complaint with the FTC for violating federal law regarding unauthorized and inaccurate reporting. 
2. Lawsuit for Violations of FCRA, GLBA, and Other Applicable Laws : Willful noncompliance will result in statutory damages, including fines of up to {$1000.00} per violation under FCRA 1681n, along with possible punitive damages for fraud. 
3. Filing an Arbitration Claim : I will pursue arbitration for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of my legal rights, including claims for damages related to defamation, emotional distress, and financial harm caused by these fraudulent entries. 
4. Court Fees and Arbitration Fees : In addition to the penalties above, the companies and credit reporting agencies may face court and arbitration fees totaling {$500.00} to {$3000.00} per claim. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue these claims in full to ensure my rights are upheld and that proper compensation is provided. 

Resolution Request : I demand the following actions be taken immediately : 1. Immediate Removal of All Unauthorized Accounts, Addresses, and Names from my credit report, as mandated by federal law. 
2. Written Confirmation from each credit bureau acknowledging the unauthorized nature of these accounts and confirming their permanent removal. 
3. Verification of Compliance : Each credit bureau must implement improvements to ensure that unauthorized reporting does not occur in the future. 

Conclusion : As a victim of fraudulent and unauthorized reporting, I am entitled to immediate removal of these inaccuracies from my credit report. The credit reporting agencies have ignored their legal obligations, misrepresented my creditworthiness, and caused significant harm to my financial reputation. I expect full compliance with these demands and a resolution within four ( 4 ) business days. If not, I will pursue all legal remedies, including escalating this matter to regulatory authorities.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,31015,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10973363

I am filing this complaint against Rubin & Rothman , LLC, regarding their handling of an alleged debt purportedly owed to XXXX XXXX. This case raises serious concerns about compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), and relevant federal and state laws. Rubin & Rothman , LLC claims to have provided validation of the debt, yet the validation appears insufficient under both FDCPA requirements and case law precedents. The FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ) specifies that debt validation must include evidence of the debts legitimacy, such as original account agreements or other substantive documentation. Simply providing a billing statement, as is common, does not meet the threshold for proper validation. Courts have also emphasized this principle. In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), the court held that collectors must substantiate debts with adequate and clear documentation. Rubin & Rothman, LLCs mailed response did not include sufficient proof of my obligation to repay the debt under the specific terms cited. Without such evidence, I maintain the position that this debt remains unverifiable. Rubin & Rothman , LLC 's assertion that "" charge-offs do not absolve the legal obligation to repay '' lacks clarity in addressing their role in ensuring the accuracy of credit reporting as required under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). While they claim not to report to credit bureaus directly, their actions influence the information XXXX may report. XXXX, as the creditor, remains obligated to ensure the accuracy of information furnished about this account. Any continued reporting of an unresolved or unverifiable debt violates my consumer rights to accurate reporting under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ). Rubin & Rothman initiated legal action in New York, while I am a resident of Ohio. The FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692i specifies that legal action must occur in the consumers place of residence or where the contract was signed. Initiating a case in New York violates this provision and disregards my rights as a consumer. Rubin & Rothman claims that XXXX did not issue a 1099-C. However, the lack of issuance does not negate the need for proper notification if cancellation of debt had occurred. If XXXX failed to file, this could raise questions about whether XXXX misreported financial events related to this debt to both me and the IRS. In IRS Publication XXXX, the guidelines require creditors to provide borrowers with a copy of the 1099-C to ensure transparency in reporting potential income from canceled debts. Rubin & Rothman, LLCs response to my initial complaint demonstrates an incomplete understanding of their obligations under federal law. The debt validation provided does not meet the standards required by the FDCPA, nor does it sufficiently address my concerns about FCRA compliance or legal jurisdiction. I urge the CFPB to investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure Rubin & Rothman , LLC operates in full compliance with applicable laws.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Rubin & Rothman, LLC",NY,11434,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10981280

I should not have to tell you at that transactions and experiences are excluded from consumer reports. I have, however, since XX/XX/XXXX, been telling you to STOP reporting my transactions and experiences.

It is recorded on the general ledger by debit or credit tickets. 2. Advance of funds, as in a credit card cash advance, purchase of goods at a retailer, or when a borrower activates a line of credit. 3. Activities affecting a deposit account, such as a deposit of funds or a withdrawal, carried out at the request of the account holder. Every time I use my credit card to make a purchase, that purchase is recorded in the general ledger according to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Every purchase I make is a transaction. Every purchase I make using my credit card raises my debt utilization. Debt utilization is the result of one or more a transaction. My credit card balances are based on the purchase of goods at a retailer. Purchases money or the advance of funds held on deposit is a transaction. My credit limit is a transaction. Activities such as a deposit or withdrawal reflect my payment history. My payment history is a transaction. Every transaction is a bank experience. My debt utilization, account balances, amounts due, due dates, and payment history are all transactions and experiences that must be excluded from my consumer report.

Furthermore, I've notified you over three times about the billing dispute I've been having with the referenced in this complaint since XX/XX/XXXX. After I notified you, and dispute you continued to make reports and allow reports to be made containing prohibited information. Pursuant to section 162 ( a ) of the Fair Credit Billing Act, adverse credit reporting during a billing dispute is prohibited. So even if you were permitted to make reports using my transactions and experiences, adverse reports made during a billing dispute, to any party, is prohibited.

Even after I informed you by mail and CFPB COMPLAINT of the billing dispute, you still allowed adverse credit reporting.

This is to complain against RIA XXXX: HIGH
IMPORTANCE: HIGH
[WITHOUT PREJUDICE]
I wish to practice my right as a customer of RIA to use your organisation's service, seeking a formal,
impartial investigation to amicably settle my dispute with RIA.
In order to clear up the myriad of letters and correspondences I have hitherto sent to RIA respecting my
complaint, I believe it will substantially strengthen both my case and your understanding, by taking a
deeper look at the happenings of my case, and analysing the relevant facts in an objective and
comprehensive fashion.
It is crucial to note that I have been manipulated, socially-engineered and coerced to engage these
fraudulent criminals. Much to my embarrassment, I recognise that I am the victim of an investment scam.
My complaint to the CFPB has arisen as I do not consider, by any stretch of the imagination, the conduct
of RIA to be commensurate with their legal role and responsibility to their customers. They sell a service
to look after their customers, protect their money and are a financial institution that maintains a traditional
relationship and way of working with its customers.
During the complaints process with RIA, I found their communication ineffective, which further hides
their conduct to management and diminishes the service offering to their clients. They are struggling to
adapt their business offering in the ever-changing world of IT development. The internet is presenting a
real problem which they choose to manage in a way which is not in line with rules and regulations of
CFPB as well as their own internal policy and procedures sold to their clients.
General Obligation:
Commencing on XXXX XXXX, I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated by XXXX XXXX (the Fraudsters or Company).
Money was transferred from my account in the total amount of XXXX XXXX.
When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability; common queries
include, but are not limited to, the following (i)
whether RIA did not take notice of any rule, law, or regulation, and/or possibly missed any material
elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that may have prevented them from protecting my
financial safety; (ii) whether by virtue of RIAs custodianship over my funds or by its control over them,
they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so, whether that duty was breached; (iii) whether RIA
promoted the transaction(s) in question despite being aware of the nature of the transaction(s) in question
(iv) whether RIA was in compliance with its own policies and procedures; (v) whether RIA owed duties
to myself, what the scope of those duties was, and whether RIA did not uphold those duties; (vi) whether
RIAs conduct was unfair; and (vii) whether RIA has within its power the ability to, and should,
compensate me for the harm that has befallen me.
Upon identification of such unusual or suspicious activity, it is crucial that the relevant staff member
adequately describe the factors making an activity or transaction suspicious, thoroughly depict the extent
and nature of this activity and properly communicate to the customer that such activity meets the relevant
criteria of fraud.
In providing its services to a customer, a financial institution is required by law to exercise the care and
skill of a diligent, prudent banker. In this case, this means that the payment service provider should not
turn a blind eye to known facts pointing to a real possibility that their customer is being scammed. In
other words, RIA must have had special knowledge of what was occurring or been alerted to a real
possibility of fraud taking place. The financial institution must have known or reasonably ought to have
known that I was dealing with a scammer.
Granted, there is room for diversity of view insofar as reasonableness is concerned. Indeed, there is a
sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable person involves in its application a subjective
element.
However, it must be remembered that the correct test is always reasonable care in all circumstances, not
average care. The fact that most people behave in a certain way may be good evidence that the conduct is
reasonable, but this is not necessarily the case. Although reasonableness is a very fluid concept, all of
the evidence suggests that RIA did not foresee the fraud and disregarded even the most obvious dangers
in this respect.
Situations do tend to repeat themselves and it is advisable to examine previous outcomes to see how the
standard of the reasonable person should be applied, and that lessons can be learnt from the errors of the
past.
RIAs Position:
Please find attached all relevant evidence below.
RIA conspicuously touts their security as a reason to use their service. Specifically, RIA writes on
their website:
We work hard to protect you from fraud. That's why we:
 Apply best-in-class security technologies expertise to protect you 24/7, all year round.
 Secure every method of banking we offer including online, mobile, ATM and telephone
banking.
 Offer free security software from our trusted tech partners to download on to your devices.
 Frequently train our employees on the latest practices in cyber and physical security.
 Give you the security tips and resources you need to protect yourself from potential threats.
Refuting RIAs arguments from a purely logical perspective:
RIAs position is that the features of the situation at hand do not generate a genuine obligation to protect
innocent and helpless victims; they are essentially arguing that common-sense-based approaches are
doomed to fail, leaving their exclusively technical account of the subject matter as the only meaningful
choice. For reasons which are unclear, this extremely serious situation barely gets the attention it deserves
even though ample evidence has been offered in support of this complaint.
In RIAs view, it is implied that we should not home in (and consequently rely) on unwritten laws,
practicality, good judgement, reasonableness, sharpness, sensibleness, past outcomes, and insight, when
taking appropriate precautions. To underscore, once again, such views are at odds with common sense
and are wildly irresponsible.
Imagine a view according to which the one and only thing that can make RIA morally obligated to do
something is having it written down somewhere. Pursuant to this view, if RIA encounter the suffering of
totally naive victims, they are only obligated to intervene in or remedy the situation, to the degree
required by written material. This is unbecoming for a reputable establishment such as RIA.
I have reviewed the material hereto sent by RIA carefully, and it unfortunately provides no response to
my fundamental argument concerning the degree of care. Given its size, influence, and the resources at its
disposal, this establishment clearly had a far greater capacity than an individual such as myself had, to
determine the level and likelihood of risk that a client such as myself is subjected to and had a duty to
intervene as they now do to query in particular out-of-pattern transactions of this kind.
It is perfectly obvious that RIA, inadvertently, employs a subtle approach in addressing some of the key
questions in a manner which neither provides me with adequate support nor protects anything other than
its own interests.
It is RIA here, who has the burden of proof, to show that it has exercised the duty of care, that is to say,
that RIA adhered to a standard of reasonable care in relation to the matter at issue given its extensive
experience compared to mine. It is RIA that claims that the damages which I have suffered in connection
to this matter have not been reasonably foreseeable, and that my proposed degree of care is not, and has
not been, commensurate with RIAs capacity, experience, expertise, or scope of services in any way. To
reemphasize, RIAs indisputable overriding purpose is by no means to purely execute transactions in a
blind and blank fashion, but rather to strike a balance between executing those transactions and
capitalising on its undeniably vast capabilities to protect consumers thereby enhancing market integrity.
Apropos of the fluidity of the concept of reasonableness, all RIA has done in this regard is set up a
dichotomy of having or not having the legal obligation under consideration, however, that does not go
one-inch toward explaining why various regulatory authorities, has maintained that financial institutions
can, and should, protect consumers using their systems, advanced technologies, and rich experience.
RIA is obliged to take some action if it is sufficiently aware of a real possibility that a fraud may be being
perpetuated. If you don't question its customers instructions or raise the possibility of a scam with the
customer in these circumstances, it may be liable if the red flags indicate the customer is:
 particularly vulnerable, or
 if the possibility of fraud was serious or real, not just suspected.
There are some recommendations to organisations for protecting customers from financial harm that
might occur as a result of fraud or financial abuse; and gives guidance on how to recognise customers
who might be at risk, how to assess the potential risks to the individual and how to take the necessary
actions to prevent or minimise financial harm.
These recommendations are established as a general principle, the organisation should deliver a
service that:
1) Takes a proactive approach to minimising risks, impact and incidences of financial harm and it
sets out systems and tools for the prevention and detection of fraud and financial abuse. As a general
point, it says organisations should ensure that all systems are developed using technologies and
methodologies that are effective in the prevention of fraud and financial abuse, through authorised
and unauthorised payments, thereby minimising the risk of financial harm to customers. As regards to
the detection of fraud and financial abuse, it says the organisation:
A) should have measures in place across all payment channels and products to detect suspicious
transactions or activities that might indicate fraud or financial abuse. It then lists the following
examples of suspicious activity on customer accounts:
a. multiple cheque books;
b. sudden increased spending;
c. transfers to other accounts;
d. multiple password attempts;
e. logins from new devices, multiple geographical locations;
f. sudden changes to the operation of the account; Unusual transactions are
transactions whose amount, characteristics and frequency bear no relation to the
economic activity of the customer, exceed normal market parameters or have no
apparent legal justification.
g. a withdrawal or payment for a large amount;
h. a payment or series of payments to a new payee;
i. financial activity that matches a known method of fraud or financial abuse.
B) organisations should have a process in place to ensure that staff make contact with the
customer to verify the financial activity, challenge its authenticity, explain the nature of the
suspected or detected fraud and discuss an appropriate plan of action.
RIA are yet to show, or otherwise provide me with, a compelling argument that their wide-ranging
experience and wealth of specialist knowledge in detecting transactional anomalies were not sufficient to
avert the fraud at issue. By contrast, I have provided a multitude of sound and powerful reasons by which
requiring their involvement has not only been pressingly relevant but also eminently reasonable and welljustified.
Rather than empathising with and undertaking substantial efforts to convey their knowledge of the
existence of such regulations abroad and thereafter use it to protect and proactively relieve the plight of
consumers who have been cheated out of their money and whose role in society is properly fulfilled,
positively contributing to local economic growth, development and sustainability  RIA adopts a rather
insouciant attitude toward my financial predicament portrayed herein.
I am deeply convinced that the disastrous results that I have previously elaborated upon will continue to
ensue if no responsibility is adopted by RIA in relation to this matter. I have also thoroughly detailed why
they cannot simply dismiss this problem by strictly adhering to legal technicalities which, after careful
reflection, struck me as being nothing more than self-interest. Indeed, it seems to me utterly unfair to
disregard fragile, sensitive, and vulnerable consumers who are afflicted by such allegedly malevolent acts,
thereby keeping an unjust status-quo that is corrupting our society at its core.
Conclusion:
Based on my analysis, and as confirmed by various authorities concerned with such matters, there is
abundant evidence that forward-thinking financial institutions ought to take reasonable steps to forestall
fraud, or at least mitigate its risk by using an effective risk management system, demonstrating their
undisputed ability to responsibly and pre-emptively respond to questionable transactions in the digital
arena. The use of such systems, largely based on newly adopted technologies aimed at effectively
navigating the evolving threat landscape, is only one of a number of possible endeavours undertaken in
this connection, alongside the application of past knowledge and experience related to popular fraudulent
practices.
Astonishingly, I am pondering how it is that, despite being shown that RIAs business conduct was
insufficient insofar as background checks are concerned, they keep refuting their indisputable role and
responsibility in connection with the matter herein discussed. The points that I have hitherto made are too
crucial to be taken lightly. RIAs non-observance of the fundamental principles of justice  that is, to
completely overlook and not even remotely try to mitigate the suffering of vulnerable consumers is
inexcusable given the size of the establishment and the vast resources at its disposal as the direct result of
the patronage of clients like myself.
If it was, indeed, solely my responsibility, we must then believe at least one of the following clauses: a)
financial institutions have absolutely no role whatsoever in preventing and detecting fraud, b) the fraud in
question was not reasonably foreseeable, or c) the transactions in question were not sufficiently alarming.
It is extremely unfortunate that RIA pushes quite hard for me to believe all three of these thingsdespite
evidence to the contrary.
In summary, I respectively ask your organisation to consider my points, given your personal and
companywide obligation to provide a fair and reasonable investigation into the complaint.
I look forward to your input and would gladly cooperate to reach a fair and reasonable outcome.
Thank you. XXXX XXXX XXXX

Attn: Complaints/Fraud Dept.
Dear Sir or Madam,
Re: Demand Letter  Fraud
I hope this letter has correctly found itself within your complaints/fraud department as it is essential to me that
you become aware of the ordeal I have had to go through.
Commencing on XXXX XXXX I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated by XXXX XXXX (the Fraudsters or Company) with the design, development, manufacturing, promoting,
marketing, distributing, labeling, and/or sale of illegal and outright fraudulent investment services, all of
which aim at contributing to the goal of robbing and defrauding clients through a predetermined cycle of the
client losses to gains.
Money was transferred from my account in the total amount of XXXX XXXX utilizing your services.
OVERVIEW
 This letter shall thrust into the spotlight, inter alia, the increasingly important role those financial
institutions play in the fight against financial crime and fraud, and the pressing need for enhanced
supervision and vigilance within your organization.
 Heres an indisputable fact: had you looked at the wider circumstances surrounding the abovereferenced
transaction(s), this illicit transfer of wealth could have been prevented.
 Obviously, there is no consensus with respect to the degree and scope to which regulated and licensed
financial institutions must intervene and block suspicious transactions, and indeed, in so doing,
financial institutions may often cause payments to be slowed down unnecessarily or even some
legitimate payments may be rejected, however, please be noted that additional frictions such as slower
payments (such as delaying payments or freezing funds to investigate) is beneficial to and welcomed
by vulnerable customers and is widely considered to be a positive practice that is necessary in order to
maintain their financial safety, particularly for large-value and/or out of pattern.
 Executing transactions without proper authority is not only a severe regulatory offense but also an
irresponsible and reckless disregard of the customers financial safety.
 Against this background, and without derogating any of my rights, I hereby hold you liable for
financial and emotional harm as well as medical problems relating to this victimization and insist that
you reimburse my account in full within 14 days from the date of this letter.
INTRODUCTION
Financial crimes and fraud investigations often involve a high degree of sophistication, complexity, and
sensitiveness to detail. Accordingly, this letter aims to address the issue at hand as profoundly and fairly as
possible, by taking into consideration contextual regulations, laws, and bylaws, as well as guidance, standards
and rules promoted by supervisory authorities, relevant codes of practice and (where suitable) what was good
industry practice (GIP) at all times relevant hereto. The allegations contained herein are predicated either
upon knowledge with respect to myself and my own experience, or upon facts obtained through investigations
conducted by qualified third parties. I strongly believe that substantive evidence in support of the allegations
set forth herein will be found after an appropriate opportunity for discovery. Key facts supporting the
allegations contained herein are known only to the Company and/or are exclusively within their control.
The Company cleverly orchestrated a prevalent scheme of deception to lead people to invest significant sums
while knowing that those would-be investors would ultimately lose the money, they had entrusted to it. The
overall purpose of the scheme, in other words, was to target and defraud people who are often inexperienced
and naive, in pursuance of illicit wealth through various fraudulent representations.
I did not know, and through the exercise of reasonable diligence could not have discovered, the fraud
that was being perpetrated upon me by the Company. Fraud is commonly conceptualized as withholding
from the weaker party in a financial transaction (e.g., an investor) information which is necessary to make an
informed, rational or autonomous decision.
In this regard, even access to adequate information is insufficient to achieve complete autonomy. A
complication here is that the weaker party, amateur/unseasoned investors in particular, might have trouble
analyzing the data at hand sufficiently well to identify fraudulent schemes. Unfortunately, because financial
products are often abstract and complex, there is no easy solution to this problem. Therefore, full autonomy of
investors might not only require access to sufficient information, but also access to relevant technologies,
know-how, processing capabilities, and resources to analyze the information. A reasonable solution is that
financial institutions would be required to promote transparent communication in which they track the
understanding of its customers.
According to the Federal Trade Commissions interpretations of certain terms (like the words deceptive and
unfair), the FTC has found that a deceptive act or practice encompasses a representation, omission or
practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumers
detriment.
The federal courts have defined a deceptive trade practice [i] as any act or practice that has the tendency or
capacity to deceive consumers and have defined an unfair trade practice as any act or practice that offends
public policy and is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers.
The false representations and omissions made by the Company have a tendency or capacity to deceive
consumers, such as myself, into unwittingly providing funds that fueled the Companys fraudulent scheme
and are therefore, by their very nature, jointly immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, and
substantially injurious to consumers.
As a result of the Companys deceptive trade practices, I was deceived into transferring my funds for
investment returns that were never delivered. I will certainly never receive any monetary value for the
investments considering the way the Company had their scheme rigged, thus causing significant economic
damage to me. The false statements of material facts and omissions as described above; and the fraudulent
transaction(s) the Company perpetrated upon me; were unfair, unconscionable, and deceptive practices which
would have likely deceived any reasonable person under the circumstances.
MERCHANTS FRAUD SCHEME  ALLEGATIONS
The Company hired, managed, and trained personnel, and collaborated with others as accomplices to
their crimes to induce fraud that resulted in my financial and psychological damages. These include,
but are not limited to, the following allegations, all of which involve criminal, non-regulated, and
malicious activities:
1. The Company directed and instructed others to work from shell companies that were operating
from various unassociated locations across the globe.
2. The Company opened bank accounts in multiple countries and used them through their
accomplices and strawmen from around the world to conceal and disguise the identity of
illegally obtained proceeds so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources.
3. The Company intentionally committed fraudulent misrepresentation, and falsified its agent names,
credentials, competencies, qualifications and location. The Companys name is merely a brand name,
officially owned by shell corporations located offshore. In reality, the entire operation is being
conducted from elsewhere (supposed location is evidently fictitious), and on top of that the call center,
marketing, and decision making, are all being performed by completely anonymous and hidden
entities. Concealing true identities and utilizing front companies as a vehicle for a wide spectrum
of financial maneuvers is a notorious practice of criminal organizations.
4. The Company has blatantly violated international laws, as it has been practicing without a
license and funneling enormous sums of money, through countries and jurisdictions that require
registration to operate.
5. The Company provided direct investment advice - not utilizing 3rd party recommendations (e.g.,
according to Bloomberg TV/Investing.com)
6. The Company offered investment services/advice not related to real market/exchange data
(manufacturing false charts etc.). The trading platform was purposely manipulated, in a way that
each client would ineluctably and unknowingly lose money, as the trades were simply
concocted. Instead, the Companys staff and its accomplices simply pocketed the money, using
it to purchase various luxurious, non-essential items.
7. The Company prohibited my ability to withdraw my funds.
8. The Company was guaranteeing returns/yields (unrealistic ones).
9. The Company furnished me with bonuses - which are not allowed to be given.
10. My money was not held in a segregated account.
11. The Company did not advertise/disclose/was not transparent regarding the statistical data representing
the percentage of total client losses at the company.
12. The Company did not mention the commission and overnight swaps.
13. The Company did not read the risk disclosure prior to my deposit(s).
14. The Company used high pressure tactics and outbursts, which took a severe toll on my health.
15. Armed with my personal details, the Companys staff seduced me into transferring all of my
savings to them. They utilized their knowledge of my cultural context, which stressed square
and honorable business dealings along with honesty, in order to maliciously take advantage of
my trusting nature.
Please take notice that my funds were transferred through means of coercion and under false pretenses.
Attached, please find supportive statements, screenshots, and further evidence.
EXPOSING YOUR ORGANIZATIONS MISCONDUCT
I hereby allege that your organization has completely failed to adequately investigate the circumstances
surrounding the transaction(s) in question and willfully blinded itself to obvious red flags.
Many suspicions should have arisen at your organization as an issue of great concern, with respect to the
unusual activity taking place in my account. Despite the regulatory and statutory requirements your
organization should abide by as a licensed and regulated financial institution  and instead of detecting
patterns, drawing certain conclusions, and taking actions accordingly you at best, merely and insufficiently
performed some hasty and haphazard reviews of the transaction(s) or possibly asked only minimal generic
questions regarding the suspicious activities, and at worst, shut your eyes completely rather than being careful,
methodical, and vigilant. Had you bothered, you would probably have realized that the funds were associated
with fraud and financial crime, rather than some other legitimate revenue/activity.
In light of the above, and after conducting a comprehensive review of our communication/interactions,
it has become glaringly obvious to me that no adequate information and/or documentation were sought
by your organization, at best, and at worst no appropriate safeguards were implemented.
If a financial institution executes a customer order to transfer money knowing it to be dishonestly given,
shutting its eyes to the obvious fact of the dishonesty, or acting recklessly in failing to make such inquiries as
an honest and reasonable individual would undergo, it would be in breach of its duty of care, even if the
payment was made in accordance with the terms of the mandate, and the financial institution should still be
liable for negligence resulting in damages.
Compliance departments should ensure that staff members understand the legal requirements and where there
are suspicions, these suspicions be communicated to all relevant personnel whilst being investigated.
For the avoidance of doubt, reasonable grounds should not necessarily be interpreted as proof. On the basis of
various signs, you should have assumed that something suspicious was going on therefore should have
suspended transaction(s) until reasonable enquiries could be made to verify that the transaction(s)
was/were properly executed. In other words, I am a victim of your negligence for facilitating the
misappropriation of funds, and doing little to safeguard public financial interests. Any reasonable staff
member would have realized that there were many obvious, even glaring, signs that I was being defrauded.
(XXXX XXXX XXXX (in liquidation) v XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX [XXXX] XXXX XXXX) [ii]
You knew or should have known that the funds being transferred through your services did not rightfully
belong to the recipient fraudsters. Similarly, you knew or should have known that the funds being transferred
through your services serve no legitimate or lawful purpose. You turned a blind eye to the crimes that you
have facilitated and thus provided an array of essential money transfer services, acting as a vehicle, with the
awareness that it was enabling the fraudsters to commit crimes and enrich themselves with the funds of their
victims.
Your services undoubtedly served as a crucial element in the fraudulent scheme detailed herein, and you were
either unaware of your complicity in the fraud, or, more worryingly, completely aware and silent. Had you
conducted an adequate account analysis, you would have discovered the nature of the recipient, and
subsequently, disclosed and reported the fraudsters activities to law enforcement authorities/agencies and
regulators. Instead, to satisfy your financial interests, you conveniently closed your eyes, even though you
undeniably had, at all material times, the necessary controls and resources to influence, whether directly or
indirectly, those particular transactions.
You also had the duty to stop those crimes, yet you refused to do so because you were more interested in
enriching yourself, even if it meant furthering those crimes and allowing them to cause massive financial
losses to plenty of victims  many of whom are probably your customers. Therefore, it is clear that you did
not have in place adequate security measures to properly safeguard my assets  hence, you have
irreparably harmed me and, if not enjoined, will continue to irreparably harm other victims as well as
their loved
ones and associates. You have irreparably harmed me and, if not enjoined, will continue to irreparably
harm the general public, and our society deserves better.
A financial institution which wrongly pays money away when it has no authority to do so will usually be
treated as if it had paid using its own funds, not those of its customer.
When discussing the responsibilities that a financial institution might incur, it is crucial not to forget the fact
that a legitimate complaint by, or cause of action on the part of, a client might generate/give rise to further
statutory cause of action and/or additional liabilities beholden by a financial institution to the relevant
regulatory authority. Obligations/duties beholden by a financial institution to a regulator are distinct from
those beholden to the customer. Moreover, you may be held liable to more than one regulator.
As a regulated and licensed financial institution, you have strict statutory and regulatory obligations to
monitor transactions and report any suspicious activities to law enforcement authorities. The importance of
implementing robust internal systems to detect and report money laundering and other suspicious activities
has been continuously emphasized in the industry in addition to having the appropriate policies, procedures
and internal controls in place to ensure ongoing compliance in respect to the aforementioned systems. You
should have analysed and distinguished thereafter between that which may be normal activity and that which
could suggest an illegal activity. This is a well-known standard industry practice which plays a substantial role
in preventing criminals from liquidating and laundering funds.
FRAUD
Actual fraud can be described, inter alia, as suppression of that which is true, by one having knowledge or
belief of the fact. Therefore, due to your actual knowledge that such scams are so prevalent, you are liable for
damages. Similarly, due to the fact that you knew or were grossly negligent in not kn",,"Ria Envia, LLC",,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10981005

This letter outlines the specific issues with my report, cites relevant FCRA provisions, and demands immediate corrective action to rectify these violations. 

Issue Summary The inaccuracies pertain to a XXXXXXXX XXXX account ( Account Number XXXX ) ** listed on my TransUnion report ( Report Number XXXX, Date Generated XX/XX/XXXX ). The issues include the following : The account is marked as charged off but continues to reflect an available credit limit. This is inconsistent with the nature of a charged-off account and creates a misrepresentation of the account 's status. 

XXXX has reported a payment made in XX/XX/XXXX, while TransUnion reports the account as 30 days late during the same period. These discrepancies are significant and highlight the inaccurate and inconsistent reporting of this account across credit reporting agencies. 

Despite my dispute and request for deletion of this inaccurate information, TransUnion claims the disputed item has been verified. However, no valid documentation has been provided to substantiate the claim of accuracy, constituting a clear violation of the FCRA.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), TransUnion is legally obligated to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information it reports. Specifically : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Consumer reporting agencies must adopt reasonable procedures to assure maximum accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Upon notification of a dispute by a consumer, a credit reporting agency must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information or delete it within 30 days.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) If information can not be verified, it must be deleted.

Your response to my dispute states that the disputed item has been "" verified. '' However, this verification lacks credibility as it directly conflicts with my XXXX and XXXX reports. Such a discrepancy demonstrates a failure in the investigation process and a violation of the FCRA.

The name and employee identification number of the individual ( s ) who conducted the investigation and determined the validity of this information.

Proof that this verification was conducted independently and not solely through the E-Oscar system, as such automated processes have repeatedly failed to meet the "" reasonable investigation '' standard required under the FCRA.

Immediate Resolution Demanded : If TransUnion can not provide the requested documentation or independently verify the accuracy of the disputed information, I demand the immediate deletion of the inaccurate account entry from my credit report. 

Legal Precedents : TransUnion 's failure to act on this matter constitutes a violation of federal law and subjects the agency to liability under the FCRA.

By continuing to report inaccurate information, TransUnion is violating my consumer rights under federal law, using false, misleading, and deceptive practices. If immediate corrective action is not taken, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), file a formal complaint, and pursue all available legal remedies. 

I expect a complete response within the timeline mandated by the FCRA. Please treat this letter as formal notice of your obligation to comply with federal law.

Summary of Dispute The account in question is a Department of XXXX account XXXX Account XXXX XXXX. I, the consumer, have previously informed TransUnion that this account contains inaccuracies and should be removed. A report I received from TransUnion ( Report Number XXXX, Date Generated : XX/XX/XXXX ) states that the disputed item was verified. However, the data provided between TransUnion and other credit bureaus, such as XXXX, are inconsistent. 

XXXX Report claims 90-day late payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX Report claims 90-day late payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
These discrepancies demonstrate clear misrepresentation of my payment history. Furthermore, I was never 30 days late, 60 days late, and then 90 days late, as reported. This pattern of reporting is not only inconsistent but blatantly inaccurate, violating my consumer rights under the FCRA. 

Legal Violations Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ), consumer reporting agencies have a legal obligation to ensure accuracy, fairness, and privacy in credit reporting. Specifically : Section 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Credit reporting agencies must conduct a reasonable investigation of disputes, correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information, and do so within 30 days of the dispute being filed. 
Section 1681e ( b ) : Consumer reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information. 
Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has held credit reporting agencies accountable for failing to address inaccuracies in credit reports. Cases such as FTC v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX demonstrate that agencies may face legal repercussions for misrepresentation and failure to investigate or correct consumer information adequately. 

Request for Immediate Action Given the continuous misrepresentation of my payment history and the failure of TransUnion to validate the accuracy of the disputed account, I demand the following : Immediate Correction or Deletion of the Account : If TransUnion can not provide documentation proving the accuracy of this account, including the name and employee number of the individual who verified the dispute, the account must be deleted. I am not requesting an automated E-OSCAR response or review; I expect specific documentation showing the validation process and its findings. 
Documentation Used for Validation : If TransUnion continues to claim the account is valid, I demand copies of all documentation used to verify this account, including any correspondence with the furnisher of the information. 
Investigation by the CFPB : I request the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly, as TransUnions actions violate federal law and misrepresent my credit history. 
References to Legal Precedent FTC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : This case addressed inaccuracies and the failure to correct consumer information as required under the FCRA. 
FTC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : Highlighted the need for consumer reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure accuracy and avoid deceptive practices. 
TransUnions actions represent false, misleading, and deceptive practices, further compounding the emotional and financial harm caused by inaccurate reporting. 

Conclusion As a consumer, I have the right to an accurate credit report under the FCRA. TransUnion has failed to meet its legal obligations, resulting in a continuous misrepresentation of my payment history. I trust the CFPB will act promptly to address these violations and hold TransUnion accountable for its actions. 

Please let me know if you require any additional documentation or information to proceed with this investigation.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) [ Address ] Subject : Formal Complaint Against TransUnion for Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally file a complaint against TransUnion for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), including the misrepresentation and reporting of inaccurate information on my credit report. This letter will outline the specific issues with my report, cite relevant FCRA provisions, and request immediate corrective actions to address these violations. 

Issue at Hand The inaccuracies pertain to an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account Number XXXX ). On my TransUnion report ( Report Number XXXX, Date Generated XX/XX/XXXX ), the account is noted as "" charged off. '' However, the report simultaneously reflects that a credit limit remains available on this charged-off account. This is inconsistent with the accounts treatment as charged off and conflicts with information reported by other credit agencies. 

I previously disputed this account with TransUnion, requesting its deletion due to these inaccuracies and inconsistencies. However, TransUnion stated the disputed item was verified without providing adequate documentation to substantiate this validation. I contend that the continued reporting of this account as it stands constitutes a misrepresentation and violates my rights under the FCRA. 

Relevant FCRA Provisions and Obligations Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, consumer reporting agencies like TransUnion are obligated to : Ensure Maximum Possible Accuracy : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

Correct or Delete Inaccurate, Incomplete, or Unverifiable Information : 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Upon receiving a dispute from a consumer, a consumer reporting agency must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate. If the information is found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or can not be verified, it must be corrected or deleted within 30 days.

Avoid Misrepresentation or Deceptive Practices : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : Furnishers of information must provide accurate information to consumer reporting agencies and promptly update any inaccurate or incomplete information.

Provide Documentation for Verification : If TransUnion asserts that the disputed item is verified, it must provide the documentation relied upon for verification under the FCRA. Failure to do so violates the transparency and accuracy requirements of the FCRA. 
Request for Documentation and Correction In light of the above provisions, I request the following : Immediate removal of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account ( Account Number XXXX ) from my credit report due to its inaccurate and misleading representation. 

If TransUnion continues to assert that the information is valid : Provide the specific documentation used to validate the accuracy of the account. 
Provide the name and employee identification number of the individual ( s ) who validated the account. 
Explicitly confirm that the verification was not conducted solely through an E-Oscar review. 
Acknowledgment that the continued reporting of this inaccurate information constitutes misrepresentation, which violates both the FCRA and my rights as a consumer. 

Supporting Case Law and Precedents Several cases have demonstrated the liability of credit agencies for misrepresentation and inaccurate reporting : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) : XXXX was found liable for failing to ensure accurate reporting and for failing to correct inaccuracies even after consumer disputes. 

XXXX v. TransUnion, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) : TransUnion was held liable for inaccurately placing consumers on a terrorism watchlist without proper verification, highlighting the importance of accurate and non-misleading reporting. 

Legal Recourse If TransUnion fails to provide the requested documentation or correct the inaccuracies, I will consider pursuing legal remedies for their violations of the FCRA. This includes, but is not limited to, filing a lawsuit for damages caused by their misrepresentation and failure to correct or delete inaccurate information as required by law. 

Conclusion I demand immediate corrective action to address these violations. If no resolution is reached promptly, I will escalate this matter further through legal channels and regulatory complaints.

I purchased an item from Amazon and it was delivered on XX/XX/year>. Part of the payment for this item was from my rewards money ( {$11.00} ). On XX/XX/XXXX I returned this item. Until today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I still haven't received the refund of my reward money. I called Synchrony and I understand that they have escalated the matter. I am hoping they will solve this soon. 

What I'm actually complaining about is the fact that there is no transparency in showing us the detailed transactions of the reward money. On Synchrony website or phone app we can only see the balance. There's nowhere to see individual transactions. If I didn't monitor the balance, I wouldn't have found that the {$11.00} was never credited to my reward account. Because of this incident, now I am not sure if any of my previous refunds was ever credited to my reward account, and I can't even check if they were or weren't.

This application got denied immediately because I have submitted too many applications with Citi bank in the last months trying to get approved for this card specifically, what caused me a lot of concerns was that Citi bank is not pulling my credit no more. Right after I got the denied letter in the mail, I called the reconsideration line, and XXXX of the managers provided me with the option to overwrite this application and pulled my credit report since I was asking for it. I gave him the authorization and he moved forward. This time the application asked for extra documentation, specifically the form 4506-C REQUUEST FOR TRANSCRIPT OF TAX RETURN. I filled out the document correctly ( attached ) and I sent it to the email mentioned on the letter : XXXX. 
One more time I did a call to the customer service department to confim that the letter was received correctly, then I waited for XXXX  days until I got a text message saying that the card application was denied. 
When I received the letter, the reason described was WE COULDNT VERIFY SOME OF THE INFORMATION ON YOUR APPLICATION, And this is the big concern I have right now. I have the right as a customer of a financial institution to know the real reason of why my card application got denied, one more time i called to the reconsideration line department and the Managers response was : we cant tell you why you got denied and theres nothing else I can do. Thats not ethical or professional from CITI bank. 
By law, and the federal equal credit opportunity, all customer has the right to understand why a financial institution is not approving a credit product, and the reason mentioned in the letter doesnt help and it gets open to a different interpretations such discrimination.

2024-11-30,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"Escalation : Wells Fargos Negligence in Addressing Fraudulent Transactions To the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), This complaint follows my prior submission ( CFPB Complaint Number : # XXXX ) against Wells Fargo Bank , N.A., for their failure to address fraudulent transactions on my accounts. Despite promptly reporting the issue, including an in-person visit to a Wells Fargo branch while the fraudulent transaction was pending, the bank failed to act. Their negligence demonstrates a complete disregard for their legal and fiduciary obligations. 

Incident Overview Date of Incident : XX/XX/year> Fraudulent Transactions : {$1600.00} was moved without authorization from my Wells Fargo credit card to my checking account. 
{$2400.00} was subsequently withdrawn from my checking account via an unauthorized auto-pay labeled XXXX. 
An unauthorized {$0.00} deposit attempt was made via XXXX authentication, indicating fraudulent activity. 

Branch Visit : I immediately visited a Wells Fargo branch when I noticed the fraudulent transaction was pending. Despite my urgency and the attempt to potentially stop the transaction at that stage, the branch staff failed to take any meaningful action to freeze the transaction, prevent further fraudulent activity, or escalate the issue internally. 

Wells Fargos Failure to Act Premature Closure : Wells Fargo later closed my internal complaint ( # XXXX ) without conducting any investigation or communicating their actions. 
Lack of Communication : The bank has not contacted me directly to inform what actual steps are they taking and timeframe for reimbursement of fraudulently withdrawn funds Neglect of Duty : Their inaction during the pending stage of the transaction, as well as their subsequent handling of the issue, violates consumer protection laws requiring financial institutions to investigate fraud promptly and transparently.

Federal and State Escalation Due to Wells Fargos gross negligence, I am left with no other option but to file complaints with multiple regulatory and law enforcement agencies : CFPB Complaint Number : # XXXX FTC Identity Theft Report Number : # XXXX Police Report : XXXX Police Department XXXX XXXX ( # XXXX ) XXXX Complaint Number : XXXX FDIC Complaint Number : # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX Each of these complaints outlines Wells Fargos failure to fulfill its legal responsibilities, protect customer accounts, and provide direct communication, while highlighting proactive action from me to alert the right authorities.

Request for Public Awareness I respectfully request that the CFPB publish this description on consumerfinance.gov so that other consumers can learn from my experience. It is critical to highlight Wells Fargos systemic negligence and failure to respond to clear fraud, so that others are informed and can take preventive measures when dealing with similar situations.

Conclusion Wells Fargos failure to act even when the fraudulent transaction was pending, combined with their subsequent negligence, has caused significant financial and emotional distress. I urge the CFPB to take action to ensure Wells Fargo complies with federal regulations, investigates these fraudulent transactions, and safeguards other consumers from similar harm.

As far as I understand it was only sent the XX/XX/XXXX, but I can not say for certain. Unfortunately there was a typo in the forelast digit of the bank account number so allegedly the money was sent to a wrong bank account. My sending bank told me to wait for the money to be "" rebounced '' by the recipient bank ( Chase ) for a month. That never happened. Nor did it reach my account with Chase. Now Chase says they do not know where the money is, they would not have it. As my sending bank in XXXX claims to not have it either, XXXX of them is lying. Why I think it is Chase : Chase 's answers were ambiguous and contradictory. They would never answer my sending bank 's ( XXXX ) recalls of the claim ( XXXX of them on the XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) nor give me explicit written confirmation the money was NOT with them, only via telephone. Sometimes due to privacy policy, they could not tell me if there even was this account with the wrong account number, left alone tell me if the money ended up in this account, sometimes they said they never received any recalls from my sending bank. Last but not least, they have now informed me that the money has NEVER reached Chase, that there is and NEVER has been ANY trace of that money whatsoever, via telephone. In written form they have sent an answer so standardised, it does not reflect their spoken statement at all and quite frankly does not make sense. I asked them to give me a more concrete answer in written form, which they affirmed, only to send me the exact same answer again. 

That seems odd since 1. I have a transfer receipt of my sending bank and the little fact that the money is NOT at my disposal neither on my XXXX ( Wise ) nor on my US bank account ( Chase ). 
2. Chase is the "" American banking partner '' of XXXX, so even if I would have sent this money to any other US bank institute, it would have been through the channels of Chase. 

So what Chase basically said they failed in contacting themselves and they can not find nor reclaim the money which was evidently sent to them and they must at least have a trace of it, if not as a recipient, than at least as the transmitting banking institute.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,93117,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10979676

Despite this, I was charged {$390.00}. On XX/XX/year>, I filed a chargeback request with Citibank, citing that the cancellation was initiated by the hotel and not by me, making me eligible for a refund. The dispute reference for this case is XXXX. 

Citibank investigated the claim but denied the chargeback, stating that the merchant provided a cancellation policy. However, this policy is irrelevant since the cancellation was beyond my control. 

Furthermore, Citibank failed to notify me of the investigation 's status or provide an opportunity to submit supporting evidence. As a result, I was unable to present critical documents, including correspondence with the hotel confirming their responsibility for the cancellation. 

This unresolved chargeback has caused my account to become overdrafted, and now it has been reported to risk agencies. This has created unnecessary financial and reputational harm.

2024-11-30,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I have been trying to apply for a small loan with these online loan companies for about a month but kept getting turned down. About one week ago, I received a call from someone working at XXXX XXXX telling me that I was eligible for a loan. After looking online for information on the company, I provided information over the telephone believing that it was a legitimate application process. After the information was taken, I was told to input information into the bank verification portal that was accessed via a link that was emailed to me, to which I provided my name, social security number, phone number, the name of my financial institution, the username and password to the bank 's mobile application. When all of this was completed, the person I spoke with on the phone informed me that a small amount would be deposited into the account to verify the account and that I had to go send it back after it was credited. I was also told that by doing this, this would increase my credit score and the loan proceeds would be deposited into the account. After receiving the amounts deposited into my checking account, I duly went and sent the funds back via making payments at XXXX off of my debit card. This was done three times. In the meantime, I kept receiving alerts from my bank that I had filed a dispute, which I could not discern what they were talking about. then on XX/XX/2024, I was contacted by this "" loan employee '' that another payment had to be deposited into my account to increase my credit score so that I could receive the loan proceeds. I was instructed to take those funds out and return it to this finance company in the same process as the other payments. However, the bank flagged the check for verification purposes and was told that it would be held for nearly two weeks. I informed this person of same and in response, two more online checks were deposited, and the bank returned these checks as fraudulent and altered. On XXXX XXXX, I was informed by one of my creditors that a payment made three months ago was reversed. I immediately checked my checking account, and it was then that I discovered that several payments made over three months ago had been reversed and the credits were the amounts taken out of my checking account to pay this scammer, and that my account balance was nearly {$1000.00} in the negative. I reported everything to the bank and the account has been frozen. However, I was told that I was on the hook for the negative bank balance. A report has been filed with my local law enforcement agency and I have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and the XXXX XXXX XXXX I now have to contact my cable company, another bank and my car insurer and inform them of the fraud and try to mitigate the damage that this is causing. The bank claims that they are immune to any damages because I approved the reversals -- I did not put in any request to dispute and/or reverse the charges, the scammer pulled this stunt and I'm stuck out and I hope I do not have to seek legal recourse.

Last complaint against this company, Portfolio Recovery Associates was on XX/XX/XXXX and received a response back from the company on XX/XX/XXXX. The ending statement was Portfolio Recovery Associates would cease all communications with me regarding this alleged account unless otherwise permitted or required by acceptable law. This was in response to my letters of cease and desist and requested documents as to this alleged debt sent certified mail on XX/XX/XXXX with signature required as delivery confirmation. This information was received by Portfolio Recovery Associates on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX pm as seen in documents provided in this complaint. While awaiting the documents I requested an investigation by the credit bureaus on this on XX/XX/XXXX. As to the outcome investigation, this alleged account # XXXX was deleted from my credit report as a result of the original creditor, XXXX XXXX  in a customer assistance program I was in and completed paying back a certain portion, the balance was forgiven by XXXX XXXX  in a XXXX form. This ongoing and harassing contact by Portfolio Recovery associates as to this alleged debt has continued which resulted in XXXX prior complaints with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Ive sent a cease and desist letter along with requests for specific documentation to this alleged debt but since sending these letters on XX/XX/XXXX to Portfolio Recovery Associates and received by Portfolio Recovery Associates on XX/XX/XXXX I have or received Any of my requested documents from either XXXX  nor Portfolio Recovery Associates since. In my last complaint to Portfolio Recovery Associates, I stated I would file a more formal complaint, possible criminal or civil complaints if this harassment continues. Now, today, XX/XX/XXXX I received ANOTHER letter from Portfolio Recovery Associates with identical information as to this alleged debt along with XXXX or XXXX statements from my past XXXX  XXXX  account that has nothing to do with this past account being in a customer assistance program that was completed but thinks gathering XXXX or XXXX old statements from the original account is somehow proof of a debt. This is just an ongoing, harassing, intimidation tactics this company, portfolio Recovery associates continues to choose, ignoring my demands to cease and desist communication with me, not providing requested specific documents in my certified letter sent on XX/XX/XXXX and received via signature verification on XX/XX/XXXX but to date, has not responded or sent the requested information I demand as per the law under the Federal Fair Debt Collection Act ( 15 USC 1692c ). Receiving this new letter today as to this alleged debt is now enough proof of repeated illegal and ongoing harassment and intimidation tactics by Portfolio Recovery Associates after demanding to stop all communication and refusing provide the documents Ive requested. The additional investigation by the credit bureau in removing this item from my credit report is further proof this company, Portfolio Recovery Associates is illegally continuing to contact me, causing me stress and anxiety issues. I am sending another certified mail, with signature required of cease and desist letter along with additional information AGAIN to portfolio recovery associates and will use all documents in prior reports, letters and documents to file a small claims complaint against Portfolio Recovery Associates through my attorney Im now speaking with, asking for relief in violation of the FDRA and my rights under such federal laws.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,NJ,08094,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10973768
2024-11-30,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"NOTE THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE COMPLAINT, THIS IS A NEW COMPLAINT On XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that MOHELA applied an Administrative Forbearance to my account, without any communication to me about this and after I had requested permanent removal of this forbearance on XX/XX/XXXX and had been in repayment since then. They applied this forbearance to be retroactive to XX/XX/XXXX, rendering my XX/XX/XXXX, payment ineligible for XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX I made my regular monthly payment XX/XX/XXXX I receive a billing statement reflecting a payment due on XX/XX/XXXX and shows that I am in repayment XX/XX/XXXX I receive a billing statement reflecting a payment due on XX/XX/XXXX and shows that I am in repayment On XX/XX/XXXX I called MOHELA and spoke with XXXX to request permanent removal of this forbearance. 
She stated the following : It would take XXXX days to be removed. 
Forbearance was applied due to the account transition from the old MOHELA platform to the new one. 
I can do a buy-back for XXXX once I reach XXXX  months of employment. 
Payment for XXXX was applied toward the next payment - Neither will qualify for XXXX, so will need to apply for "" reconsideration '' for XXXX and XXXX due to this forbearance being applied. 
Forbearance was applied on XX/XX/XXXX and backdated to XX/XX/XXXX. 
On the same date, I spoke with XXXX about the XXXX XXXX group discharge and attached the letter I have from the Department of Education, dated XX/XX/XXXX She said she would research it and call me back. 
To date, I have not received that phone call. 

XX/XX/XXXX I receive a billing statement reflecting a payment due on XX/XX/XXXX and shows that I am in repayment XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a CFPB complaint about this issue that was closed by MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Their response to my complaint made it abundantly clear that they didn't even bother to read my complaint. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I log into MOHELA to make a payment and note that I have no payment due. 
My loan status states "" Awaiting Form Administrative Forbearance '' I called and spoke with XXXX who XXXX the following : Sees the request to opt-out of the forbearance but it was only for XXXX  day Told me I need to reach out to XXXX to request permanent removal of the forbearance XXXX  hotline phone number is XXXX This forbearance is being initiated by XXXX. 
I asked XXXX about the status of the XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX and was told that as of XX/XX/XXXX there is a "" write off for loan sequence XXXX of {$9700.00} & loan sequence XXXX of {$12000.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX '' and I should be receiving a letter very soon regarding this. 
o I called the XXXX XXXX immediately after speaking with XXXX Spoke XXXX XXXX She states that the servicer is responsible for, and the only XXXX  capable of, placing and removing forbearance XX/XX/XXXX I receive a billing statement reflecting a PAST DUE payment and shows that I am in repayment I called and spoke with XXXX She stated the following : Showing XXXX  days delinquent XXXX  forbearance was lifted on XX/XX/XXXX Repayment as of XX/XX/XXXX ( posted on XX/XX/XXXX ) May  be able to buy back these months and apply for reconsideration. 
Can remove the past due amount through an admin forbearance for this month only. 
XX/XX/XXXX log into MOHELA to make a payment, notice that account is once again in forbearance Spoke with XXXX She states XXXX applies the forbearance. 
I stated that is not true, that the servicer applies and removes the forbearance and ask her to please remove it. 
She states she is transferring me to the "" advanced '' department for more assistance. 
I get transferred to a line with a XXXX minute wait. 
I finally speak with someone named XXXX. 
XXXX is rude. 
States she is opting me out of the XXXX forbearance. 
States she is entering the request and that it goes to the MOHELA loan servicing department. 
I asked how to prevent this from happening again. 
She said this is XXXX fault. That XXXX is causing this to happen. 
I said this is not true, that XXXX is not causing this to happen and that I successfully had the forbearance lifted from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX without a problem and that all the sudden it is being reapplied by MOHELA without any communication to me and that this is interfering with my ability to make payments toward PSLF. I also said that this is quite upsetting because it keeps happening. She said that she can see where I've called before to ask for it to be lifted but that I have not asked for it to be "" permanently '' lifted, so that's what she's asking to happen. ( XXXX??? ) She also asked if I wanted her to cancel my XXXX request or just the forbearance. I stated, 'do not cancel my XXXX  request, I only want the forbearance removed so that I can make payments toward PSLF ', then she said 'I can't cancel the XXXX request ma'am '.

I asked again, how do I prevent this from happening again. I just want to be able to make my payments. 
She said, "" we're not going to think like that, we're just going to hope it doesn't happen again '' Then I asked her about the XXXX XXXX XXXX discharge and she basically blew me off with 'nothing has changed since the last time you asked '. 
I do not operate on "" hopes and wishes '', especially when money and time are involved. 
I want this STOPPED. I want the forbearance permanently removed and I want this fixed with FSA to reflect accurately. 
It is 100 % MOHELA 's fault that I now have XXXX ineligible months of employment for XXXX. This is completely inexcusable. 
I want to know the status of the XXXX XXXX XXXX discharge for my account. 
MOHELA 's reps keep telling me that it has been completed, but this is patently untrue. The dates they've given me correlate to my most recent consolidation, pre-date the group discharge letter, and do not add up to the total amount borrowed and disbursed for XXXX XXXX ( which is easy enough to identify via the loan data ). 
Furthermore, the group discharge is not a "" write off '', it is a discharge. This should come off my balance and I should be refunded any payments made toward those loans ( per FSA ).",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,OH,45440,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978493

In total, my student loan account is missing XXXX, in addition to whatever I paid on interest that didn't calculate the correct amount that I actually paid.

2024-11-30,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"XX/XX/year> : Received a text notification of a false attempt to utilize my Chase Bank debit card at a cafe in XXXX Georgia while I was at work nowhere near there. I took time to change my username & password for security reasons. I checked my accounts and noticed 30+ unauthorized XXXX XXXX being processed on both my Chase Bank personal and business checking accounts to an unknown XXXX XXXX. Each transfer, other than the {$5.00}, was somewhere in the {$60.00} to {$79.00} range. 

I called Chase immediately to report the fraud and to freeze both of my accounts. By that point, a total of {$5.00} from my personal checking account and a total of around {$3000.00} from my business account had been withdrawn. There were about {$2000.00} of XXXX payments that were still in the process status that luckily got cancelled before it was too late. I informed the customer service representative that I want to make a fraud claim as these were all transactions that I did not make or approve for anyone else to make on my behalf. I was informed that there would be an investigation and that the money would be credited back. The bank immediately credited the personal account the {$5.00} back, contingent on the investigation. 

XX/XX/year> : XXXX PM, I called the Chase Bank Fraud Dept as it had been a week and I had not heard any updates and no credit had been applied to my accounts. The customer representative said that the investigation was ongoing but that the {$3000.00} was scheduled to be deposited back to the business account no later than XX/XX/XXXX, but could possibly be applied even sooner. 

XX/XX/year> : XXXX PM, My wife ( also listed on both accounts ) gets an email from Chase regarding the {$5.00} fraud claim on the personal checking account. We logged on to get the document and it stated, "" We have researched the transaction ( s ) you reported on XX/XX/year>. 
We found that the transaction ( s ) was processed according to the information you provided or was authorized. 
As a result, we are removing {$5.00} from your account on or after XX/XX/year>. If the account the claim is related to is no longer open with Chase, and you don't have an open account with Chase for us to debit, we may request you to repay the credit ( s ).

Contact us if you would like to request the information we used for our research. '' They indeed removed the {$5.00}. Again, this transaction was not authorized nor do we know the account it transferred to. 

This prompted us to check for a similar letter on the business account. ( As of this writing, I have not received any notice of a decision regarding the business account. We found it only because of the personal account claim notification. ) We did find a letter online regarding the business checking fraud claim which stated : "" We have researched the transaction ( s ) you reported on XX/XX/year>. 
Here 's what you should know : We found that the transaction ( s ) was processed according to the information you provided or was authorized. 
No adjustment will be made to your account at this time. 
Contact us if you would like to request the information we used for our research. '' So nothing will be credited to the business account. Also again, these transactions were not authorized nor do we know the account it transferred to. 

XXXX PM, I called the Chase Bank Fraud Dept to find out what exactly they meant and what the next step is. I was told by the representative that the claim had been denied and the case had been closed because they found something with the log-in history and ISP being consistent with my banking. No new devices detected. No password change. Things were consistent with my log-in history. 

I was told the only course of action I could take now is to contact my ISP provider to request a document stating that someone logged into my ISP from somewhere else. I requested to speak to a XXXX or a person from the XXXX XXXX but was told there was no way to transfer to me such a person. They'd have to submit a notification and I will have to wait for them to get back to me. 

XXXX PM. I contacted my mobile carrier for such a document since I was on the on cell service during the time the fraud occurred. The XXXX XXXX Representative told me that they can't determine these things in a situation ; that the best I can do is print out my text log from that day to show that I didn't get any log-in/2 step verification for the account access. Because I have XXXX step multi factor authenticator.

I explained this was my rent money and then inquired about my pending bank transfer of {$1600.00} into Venmo. At that point on XX/XX/XXXX, there was only the {$1100.00} in the account. I called customer support twice and was told that given my account status that the pending bank transfer would be rejected from Venmo and would be sent back to my bank ( discover ) on XX/XX/XXXX and would receive it by Friday. At XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX Venmo allowed the bank transfer to go through even though they permanently deactivated my account the day before. I sent several emails to the account specialist as to why the transfer from my bank to Venmo was allowed after being told it would not be. Venmo never answered my question and proceeded to inform me again that my money was going to be held for up to 180 days and they were not going to respond any further and the case is considered closed. I offered to submit bank statements and whatever else they needed to release my {$2700.00} in my Venmo",,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",AL,36526,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10981312

Apparently it involved many customer accounts opened in 2024. The bank, when we learned of multiple wrongful Federal Backup Withholding debits to our CD accounts, implied that we chose to have to have that done which was not correct. Upon further inquiry, it was learned, and they admitted, that Marcus experienced a major systems error causing wrongful Backup Withholding debits from a large number of customer accounts. They refused to tell us how many customers were impacted. The transactions were not clearly identifiable on our online account information website and to date the full amount of the wrongful debits have not been credited back. The full accounting of the debit transactions by account is not apparent on the website suggesting additional concerns. Some corresponding credits and their associated accrued interest don't seem to line up with the wrongful debit amounts. It's been 2 months and thus far the matter has not been fully resolved. Customers are now put into the position of having to audit all their Marcus accounts and will have difficulty doing so without full transaction information which remains mysteriously absent.",,GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA,FL,32164,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10978481

I caught it in time, when Mohela emailed me what my upcoming payment amount was for, and had them cancel the payment of {$430.00}. This caused an issue with my rate reduction program, so I had to reapply for the rate reduction, and it raised my payment to {$440.00}, starting on XX/XX/XXXX. Even though I'd agreed to all the paperwork, and scheduled the payment, my account never showed the payment change to {$440.00} and it just says that a rate reduction application is pending, and I'm not sure the issue as they can't give me an answer. I received an email from Mohela about my upcoming payment on XX/XX/XXXX, and it was listed as being {$1200.00}. I did the math, and it appeared that they now had 3 payments scheduled to come out on that day ( {$410.00}, {$430.00}, and the correct {$440.00} ). I called to speak with an agent, who said that she saw an additional payment of {$430.00}, but not one for {$410.00}. I accepted her answer, but for clarity, chatted with another agent the next day, who said the same thing. I asked that if there was an issue, and I was charged an extra payment, would they be able to reverse that payment and refund me. I was told that they would be able to. Well, today, XX/XX/year>, my bank account was hit with 2 payments from Mohela. 1 for {$440.00} and another for {$410.00}. Not only that, my account lists that I am past due on a payment due to the fact that they've never finalized my application and adjusted my payment. I've reached out to Mohela to get this corrected, and will be filing a dispute with my bank on the errant transaction. I've done everything in my power to get this corrected, and keep my account current, as it was with XXXX  before it was transferred, but I'm not sure if I'm dealing with negligence or incompetence and would like help in getting this resolved.",,MOHELA,MD,206XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10973063

I was not working and did not have good credit at the time so my mother co-signed the loans for me. Once I graduated, I put forth best efforts to repay the loan. However, I had severe financial struggles and needed multiple forbearances. I lost my mother in XXXX and was told that I was no longer eligible for forbearances because I maxed out. When I explained to them that my mother died and I was experiencing health issues, they told me that I had to make a payment or I'd default, I started paying them with credit cards to prevent default. In XXXX, I applied for and was granted XXXX  XXXX bankruptcy but my attorney refused to argue for student loan forgiveness in the separate hearing. I could not afford another attorney to handle the special hearing for student loans. Navient did not acknowledge my mother 's death until XXXX when I received a letter from them saying they recently learned of her death although I'd been telling them for years. My struggles with Navient lasted from XXXX  through XXXX when I could no longer afford my payments and refused to pay interest only. My total loan balances ballooned from the initial {$14000.00} to over {$41000.00}. I spoke to multiple representatives during this time about their predatory lending practices and offered to pay the amount I borrowed if they would remove all of the years of interest they had tacked on. I argued that even when I made payments, my balances continued to increase. They offered to settle for 60 % of the balance, to be paid in three installments. The amount was unfair and I explained that I did not have that type of money to pay them. I stopped taking their calls and Navient then started calling people associated with my and disclosing the matter to them, violating my privacy. They left a detailed voicemail on my sister 's phone. They called my husband and disclosed the matter to him, and I was not married when these loans were taken. He was not aware of the matter. The also left messages on my son 's phone. They started reaching out to past employers as well. During this time, they threatened me with legal action. Finally, when trying to embarrass me did not work, and threatening legal action did not work, they sold me loan to a debt collector. I feel I have made enough payments over the years that my loan should have been considered settled or even written off. Not sent to a collection agency to further harm my credit, after multiple offers from myself to try to resolve the matter. Their practices are illegal and unjust.

2024-11-30,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Subject : Formal Complaint Against Equifax for FCRA Violations and Misrepresentation Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am submitting this formal complaint against Equifax for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) concerning inaccurate and misrepresented information on my credit report. Despite my repeated efforts to address these inaccuracies, Equifax has failed to correct the errors and continues to report misleading information regarding an account with the Department of EducationXXXX XXXX Account Number XXXX ). 

Summary of Dispute The account in question is being reported inconsistently by Equifax and other credit bureaus, including XXXX. Equifax provided a report ( Report Number XXXX, Date Generated : XX/XX/XXXX ), stating that the disputed item was verified. However, the details of the payment history differ significantly : Equifaxs Report shows 90-day late payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX Report shows 90-day late payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
These discrepancies are not minor ; they are clear errors and misrepresentations of my payment history. Furthermore, no report correctly represents the progression of late payments ( 30 days, 60 days, 90 days ). I have never been late as described, and this false reporting violates my rights under the FCRA. Legal Violations Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.
), Equifax has specific legal obligations to ensure the accuracy and fairness of consumer reporting. The violations in this case include : Section 1681e ( b ) : Failure to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information. 
Section 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Failure to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information and correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information within 30 days.

Section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) : Failure to delete or modify disputed information that can not be verified or is found to be inaccurate. 
These failures constitute a significant violation of my consumer rights, as Equifax is knowingly reporting conflicting and inaccurate information, thereby damaging my creditworthiness. 

Request for Immediate Action I demand the following actions be taken immediately to address this ongoing misrepresentation : Immediate Deletion of the Account : If Equifax can not provide concrete documentation validating the accuracy of the disputed account, including the name and employee number of the individual who verified the information, this account must be removed from my credit report. I am not requesting an automated XXXXXXXX review but a detailed explanation of the validation process. 
Provision of Validation Documentation : Equifax must provide all documents and evidence used to verify the accuracy of this account, including direct communication with the furnisher of the information. 
Investigation by the CFPB : I request the CFPB to thoroughly investigate Equifax for its repeated violations of the FCRA and failure to uphold its legal obligations. 
Legal Precedent Supporting My Case FTC vXXXX Equifax Credit Information Services , Inc., XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : This case highlighted the responsibility of credit reporting agencies to ensure accurate reporting and the consequences of failing to address consumer disputes appropriately. 
FTC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Civil Action No. XXXX : Demonstrated the accountability of credit bureaus for inaccuracies and the need for reasonable investigation procedures. 
Conclusion Equifaxs continued misrepresentation of this account and its failure to conduct a proper investigation into my dispute are clear violations of the FCRA. These actions have caused undue harm to my financial standing and must be addressed immediately. 

I trust the CFPB will take swift and decisive action to hold Equifax accountable and ensure compliance with federal laws designed to protect consumers like myself.

This constitutes harassment and a violation of my consumer rights under both state and federal law. 

I do not owe the alleged debt, and TSIs refusal to validate the debt while continuing collection attempts has caused significant frustration and distress. I request that the CFPB investigate Transworld Systems Inc. for its practices, require them to validate the alleged debt or cease all collection efforts, and ensure compliance with all relevant debt collection laws.

Specifically, the payment history reflects errors that significantly misrepresent my financial record. 

According to the reports, my XXXX XXXX account indicates that I was 90 days late in XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>. However, the account never accurately reflects a progression of delinquency from 30 days late to 60 days late and then to 90 days late, as required by standard reporting practices. Furthermore, the account was closed due to a transfer to Nelnet, yet the misrepresentation persists. 

This reporting error violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ], which mandates that credit reporting agencies and furnishers of credit information must ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. This inaccurate reporting has caused undue harm to my credit profile, and I am demanding immediate rectification of this error.

Additionally, I am aware of prior lawsuits and complaints against Nelnet concerning the misrepresentation of consumers ' accounts and erroneous credit reporting practices. For instance : Case Example : Lawsuits allege Nelnet 's failure to maintain accurate account records and properly update credit reporting agencies, which mirrors the issues I am currently experiencing. 
Violation Allegation : Misrepresentation of payment history and account status, as in my case, has led to widespread consumer harm, further supporting the need for immediate corrective action. 
I respectfully request the following actions : Immediate Correction : Amend the payment history for the referenced accounts to reflect accurate information.

Verification of Accuracy : Conduct a thorough investigation into the reporting discrepancies and provide a detailed explanation of your findings.

Notification to Credit Bureaus : Inform all credit reporting agencies of the corrections to ensure my credit profile accurately reflects my account status.

Please consider this communication a formal complaint under the FCRA. If the requested corrections are not made promptly, I reserve the right to escalate this matter further, including but not limited to seeking legal remedies. 

I trust that you will give this matter the urgent attention it deserves. I expect a written response detailing the steps taken to resolve this issue within 30 days of receiving this letter.

Moreover, this account has been reported monthly as an active account even after its alleged charge-off date, which further raises concerns about its accuracy. Such reporting may be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as it misrepresents the status of the debt.

Actions Requested : 1. Investigate XXXX failure to provide the requested XXXX form for the account listed above. 
XXXX. Verify whether XXXX XXXX XXXX the debt and issued the required documentation to the IRS. 
XXXX. If XXXX can not provide proper documentation, require them to immediately remove any inaccurate or negative reporting related to this account from my credit report. 
XXXX. Address the issue of XXXX XXXX XXXX of this account as active or delinquent despite the alleged charge-off.

Despite clear communication about the total loss status of my vehicle and the presence of GAP insurance coverage, Westlake Finance has failed to finalize the loan and collect the car. This has resulted in ongoing confusion and improper demands for payments, which I am seeking help to resolve. 

Key Issues : Car Totaled in Accident ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX XXXX XXXX was involved in an accident caused by another driver. The at-fault driver had liability insurance through XXXX, who assessed the vehicles value at {$16000.00} and declared it a total loss. I have attached the total loss letter from XXXX as proof of the vehicles totaled status. 

Failure to Finalize Loan and Collect the Car : Westlake Finance has been informed that my car was totaled, and I have communicated the total loss to them. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by a representative from Westlake Finance that they would pick up the vehicle. However, as of today, the car has not been collected, and I have not received any further communication explaining the delay or the next steps. This failure to follow through is causing unnecessary confusion and financial strain. 

GAP Insurance : Westlake Finance has GAP insurance on the loan, which should cover any remaining balance between the insurance payout and the loan amount. This should have been applied to finalize the loan balance, but instead, I am being asked to make continued payments on a car that is no longer in my possession. I have provided proof of the XXXX insurance payout and the GAP insurance policy, which should resolve the remaining balance on the loan. 

Continued Requests for Payments on a Totaled Car : Despite the car being declared totaled by Geico, Westlake Finance continues to demand monthly payments. I should not be responsible for payments on a car that is no longer in use, and I expect the loan to be settled with the insurance payout and GAP insurance coverage. 

Inconsistent Communication and Unresolved Issues : I have made multiple calls to Westlake Finance, but each time I receive conflicting information. Some representatives tell me that the car will be picked up soon, while others indicate that the loan can not be finalized until the vehicle is physically collected. I have not received any clear timeline for when the car will be collected, nor any resolution on how the loan will be paid off.",,"Westlake Services, LLC",PA,19121,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10979288

I deposited {$2900.00} in cash, and did not receive a receipt. During that same transaction, the atm rejected one of my {$100.00} bills intended for deposit. I then physically entered the branch and deposited the {$100.00} bill with a bank teller. Upon checking my bank account online immediately thereafter to see that my deposit was confirmed, no amount showed in my bank account. I then spoke to the branch manager, XXXX XXXX who informed me that I would need to call the claims department of Chases customer service. I did so, and received a temporary credit in the amount of {$2900.00} on the XXXX of XXXX in my bank account until my claim was corroborated. I was given no other information. On the XXXX of XXXX ( today ) I checked my account to find that the temporary amount of {$2900.00} credited to my account on the XXXX of XXXX had been reversed. I called the claims department, and was told that an audit had been done on the ATM, and there was no discrepancy found. I was then told to go back to the branch, and speak to the branch manager if I had further questions. I returned to that branch today and spoke with a chase associate, XXXX XXXX, as the branch manager was on vacation- I was helped, and the associate called the help line. I spoke with another person who told me the same information, and I requested video footage. I was told that footage would have to be subpoenaed, and that there was nothing else they could do.

I received the temporary funds in my account XX/XX/year> and on XX/XX/year> the funds were out of the processing phase and was fully in my account and was refunded to me as a reversal. Radio silence from XXXX XXXX  and no one reached out to me from chase bank in regards to more information or an update on my account and on XX/XX/year>XXXX  starting at XXXX the money I was refunded back to me from chase bank was being withdrawn back to XXXX XXXX with no explanation, no phone call, no email or text to give me an explanation. At XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year> I had contacted chase bank through a phone call and spoke with a representative, they had unprofessionally told me that I was in the wrong and its my fault that my money was sent back to XXXX XXXX saying first that my claim was counterfeit and after I requested documentation or a reason why it was counterfeit he changed it to my claim being invalid. I asked for a reason why my fully refunded money was transferred back to XXXX XXXX  and he kept deflecting the question and kept repeating that my claim my invalid so I asked why refund me the money if the claim was invalid and the response was we can not assume a claim is invalid when received it doesnt make sense since I answered all their questions and I was told it was a valid claim. I asked to speak to a manager or someone higher up and he refused and once I urged the representative to give me straight answer he said that XXXX reopen the investigation and the call was over since the information I requested was being held from me. After getting in contact with XXXX XXXX the representative on their side told me chase bank never reached out to them and it would be 10 business days for an update email on my claim but its been 12 days and the representative kept repeating that until I decided the call was over. At XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/year> I called chases claims department again and a more experienced representative spoke with me and told me that they had reached out to XXXX XXXX twice and XXXX XXXX  counter claimed against me with documents stating since Ive used their services before and havent had issues or reported any other transactions with their services that the claim was invalid and due to chase bank policy that had to transfer my refunded money back to XXXX XXXX, I couldnt get the documents myself since its still pending review and the investigation was not reopened by the earlier representative.

2024-11-30,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Credit Protection and Payment Mismanagement To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding my experience with XXXX  XXXX  and the subsequent transfer to PHH Mortgage during my ongoing loss mitigation process. 

For over a year, I have been engaged in a loss mitigation process with XXXX XXXX. As part of this process, I was instructed to make a mortgage payment of {$1500.00} for XX/XX/year>. Despite being advised to proceed with this payment, I later discovered that my loan was transferred to PHH Mortgage after the payment was processed. 

Upon reviewing my statement, I noticed that the payment was not applied to my mortgage account. I initially assumed that the payment was being held until the loss mitigation process was resolved. However, it has come to my attention that this payment has not reflected in my overall mortgage balance. 

I was approved for a partial payment option with an agreed mortgage amount of {$1400.00}. However, to my dismay, PHH Mortgage is now requesting a payment of {$1500.00}, less than a month after this agreement was established. This sudden increase in the payment amount is both confusing and concerning. 

I have contacted PHH Mortgage multiple times seeking clarification on the status of my payment and why it was accepted while I was still in the loss mitigation process. Unfortunately, I have yet to receive a satisfactory explanation regarding the whereabouts of my payment. 

Despite my repeated requests for information via phone, email, and mail, there has been no response from PHH Mortgage. This lack of communication and transparency is deeply concerning and has left me feeling frustrated and uncertain about my mortgage situation. 

I kindly request immediate attention to this matter and a thorough explanation of where my payment has gone, the rationale behind accepting it during the loss mitigation process, and the reason for the sudden increase in my payment amount. Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue.
