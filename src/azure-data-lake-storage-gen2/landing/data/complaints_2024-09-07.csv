2024-09-07,Credit card,Store credit card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"Today, I decided to purchase a {$890.00} XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX. The device was advertised at a XXXX XXXX sale price of {$690.00}. At checkout, XXXX XXXX solicited me for a credit card and advertised that I would receive a XXXX  % credit for future use at the store if approved and the card was used to make my first purchase. I clicked the link in the checkout cart, completed the application, and received approval for {$12000.00} in credit. I returned to the cart and clicked "" complete '' but then received a message stating that the card information was "" expired ''. I tried XXXX more times and received the same message. I then called the number provided for assistance, thinking XXXX XXXX would be happy to take my order and use the card. Instead, the sales department transferred me to XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX 's user ID, per her, is XXXX. She told me that I had been approved, but she was unsure about why the card would not work. I asked her to investigate this and she eventually told me that the reason the card would not work is that I had not completed the transaction quickly enough. Looking through my emails and phone history, I deterred that I received an email from XXXX XXXX telling me I was approved for credit at XXXX XXXX. My call history shows that I then called XXXX XXXX number ( XXXX ) at XXXX. This means that XXXX minutes passed between the time they approved me and the time I called for help. She then told me that I probably clicked out of the session? I asked her to confirm if that was the reason my card was being denied and she could not confirm this. She officially did not know, but was only guessing. I did not click other windows or sessions. She then told me that I should call a XXXX XXXX store or go to XXXX and make the order. I told her that the solicitation of credit and offer of promotion for immediate use felt like bait and switch, because now my credit score has been harmed, I was approved, and XXXX XXXX is not allowing me to use the card. She told me I should just call a store. I told her I wanted her to warm transfer me to a store and explain the situation to solve my issue. She then called XXXX XXXX Customer Service, and the rep there explained to both of us that customer service could not use a "" card on file '' to place an order and that my only option would be to visit a store. For the second time, XXXX and XXXX XXXX failed to honor the credit they solicited from me, and thus the promotion. They suggested that I wait until the card arrives in the mail and then come back. If I did that, the item I want to order will no longer be discounted for XXXX XXXX. 
I then cancelled the card with XXXX, and am no longer a XXXX XXXX Credit card customer. There are multiple issues here : XXXX ) XXXX XXXX is soliciting credit applications from online customers, approving customers for credit, and then refusing to accept that credit either due to a defective website OR a desire to deny promotional expenses they would incur if the promotions used to solicit credit applications were used. I consider this to be Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices as defined by the CFPB. XXXX ) The representatives forced to serve online customers are completely powerless to use cards solicited online? XXXX XXXX is unable to help the same customers. XXXX XXXX should cease promotion and offer of online credit as it is clearly unable and unprepared to ensure it can honor the credit it solicits or correct its own errors and defective website. XXXX ) I was transferred 3 times, and through the entire experience, no one was willing to escalate my concerns or solve my issue. Why are stores "" more powerful '' and able to use credit cards that XXXX XXXX has approved, but neither customer service for credit or online orders is enabled to do this? It is illogical, and evidence of a retailer who should invest in the tools it provides its online representatives.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,MS,39401,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-17,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10059766

BANK OF AMERICA SENT ME A LETTER STATING THAT THEY WILL NOT SEND ME MY FUNDS. 


I purchased a house from a lady and for many years I had been receiving emails and letters from Attorney XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX after I purchased his girlfriend 's friend 's home ( XXXX XXXX ) located at XXXX Deloise AveCerritos, CA XXXX I purchased the home as a Seller Finance/wrap around mortgage because at the time I only qualified for $ XXXX and she convinced me that it was best she stood on the loan and that she would help me. We agreed to a high Sales price of {$800000.00} ( close of escrow was XX/XX/XXXX ). The home was only appraised for $ XXXX at the time and an interest rate of 5.99 % which was high considering it was the coronavirus era. I paid the Seller her down payment of {$32000.00} as well as {$4600.00} a month mortgage and property taxes $ XXXX and hazard insurance $ XXXX. Since buying the home, XXXX XXXX ( her family attorney ) had sent me threatening letters telling me he will foreclose on me ( 1 month after buying the home because I told her tenants that were living there that I bought it when I was supposed to keep it a secret. She still had the home listed after I bought it trying to sell it to other people. I was scared so I recorded the deed when she asked me to wait 6 months to record it. I felt something very off about her business practices. XXXX XXXX threatened foreclosure the first year of buying it when I had proof of all payments being made on time as well as bank statements to show for it. Many times he didnt want to accept the proof I was showing and wrote me disgusting and hateful emails harassing me. 



On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent his girlfriend with whom he lives with in XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX to my home and she walked into the home at XXXX at night with XXXX XXXX XXXX the previous owner ) and started yelling at the tenants ( they had tenants they rented to when they sold the home to me ) and told them that they still own the home and that they need to continue to make their rent payments to XXXX XXXX not me-but all this was untrue as i technically owned the home at that point. XXXX XXXX owed them their security deposit and didnt want to give it back. I was truly scared because I was putting my 9 month old baby to sleep and I heard the renters yelling at her saying that she is a fraud because she just rented to them a week ago and then sold the house ( our deal took a few weeks to close so she shouldn't have done that ). The tenants even recorded this conversation so I have the recording saved. I then called the police for walking in unannounced at XXXX ( you dont buy a Home and the previous owner still comes in at night unannounced ), the police asked them to leave and we changed the locks the next day. Then again, XXXX XXXX showed up to my home for no reason on XX/XX/XXXX and stood outside from XXXX and took notes of who was coming in and out of the home and then he took pictures of all of the cars outside and was watching us looking into our windows from the outside. A week after, The water company showed up to the house and was outside turning my water off. I opened the door around XXXX to check the mail and there was a man outside that was shocked to see me. He yelled about XXXX feet away and asked XXXX XXXX, this house isnt empty? I got a call from the owner saying its empty. I told him no, I just bought the house. He then told me he would turn the water back on as the water company is not allowed to turn the water off if someone is living in the home. 



After 6 months of buying the home, XXXX XXXX threatened me saying I had to sell it back to the previous owner since the purchase contract states there's a potential buy back but it would had to be extended if its after 6 months. He e-mailed a check written by his girlfriend in my name in the amount of {$42000.00} on XXXX ( 3 days before the buy back contract expires ). I sent them contracts to see if they can perform on time but they finally gave me a XXXX  officers name on XXXX so I contacted XXXX and they said they can not close escrow in 1 day since they are closed on Saturday/Sunday. It is evident that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( whom his girlfriend and him are linked to an investment to this property ) saw that after I bought the house is XX/XX/XXXX saw that the real estate market went up and most likely had a change of XXXX about their sales price of {$800000.00} ( when again the home was only worth about $ XXXX in XXXX ). They became greedy trying to take advantage and its obvious that they tried to change their sales price to $ XXXX when you see the complaint as they finally filed a lawsuit but nothing happened as the attorney yelled at XXXX XXXX in court and he quit while she still owes him $ XXXX. If they wanted to buy back, they needed to close within the 6 month timeframe or at least have some money ( $ XXXX buy back price ) deposited into the escrow account. I asked to receive the money or some type of proof delisted to escrow but when I called escrow they had nothing and said I would take XXXX dates to close the transaction. I gave the attorney XXXX document ( provided proof of email thread ) to close fast out of escrow as they had 3 days ( a weekend ) but they did NOT perform and said theyd only do the transaction this time with an escrow company which was interesting because we never used an escrow company the first time around. 



I cooperated with them on the buy-back sale and gave proof of XXXX documents that I supplied them with to sign for in order to close escrow within the 3 days remaining. They declined to close the sale on time and wanted to close this time with escrow ( the first time we closed without an escrow company. 



In addition, 2 days after purchasing the home from XXXX XXXX, she was still showing the property to potential buyers and telling me that I can not record on the property until 6 months later. She wanted me to refinance the mortgage thats under her name with her but as long as she stays the lien holder which is illegal in the state of California and no loan officer will agree to this. I asked her to stop showing the house and to please take it off XXXX as it had sold and she refused. I had to contact XXXX and show them the purchase contract and deed recorded for them to remove the listing. 



I recorded the deed to protect my asset which was my {$32000.00} down payment, $ XXXX sales price when the home only was worth $ XXXX, a mortgage or {$4600.00}, {$670.00} in monthly property taxes, {$47.00} hazard insurance ; and an interest rate or XXXX  % not including homeowners insurance. 



She also interfered with me refinancing and would not sign the release form to get a payout from the XXXX. She wants $ XXXX or more in her pocket but doesnt understand that XXXX XXXX XXXX has to get approximately $ XXXX from the XXXX. The $ XXXX that shes requesting doesnt go to her directly, it is minus $ XXXX. 



I decided to let her have the home back, escrow contacted her and she told them I no longer want it and if she buys it back its now $ XXXX minus legal fees and property depreciation as well as furniture fees plus gardening. That she never did. 



Thus all of this had led to a lis pendens she filed because it was in escrow. She doesnt want the property she wants around $ XXXX more in what we agreed to on the sales price in XX/XX/XXXX. She even sent me a payout demand for $ XXXX when I only owe approximately $ XXXX ( will attach ). 



All of this has resulted in XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX attempt to file litigation, then postpone litigation by falsely accusing me of being in foreclosure which is not the first time it has been since a few days of buying the home. When we were in court they decided to cancel everything and withdraw the lawsuit because they did not want a XXXX XXXX and because she knew she would not win. 



As of XX/XX/XXXX the home was in escrow for $ XXXX and the buyer has their Earnest money deposit of {$26000.00} in escrow. I have spent {$16000.00} in home improvements upon buyers request such as replacing the air vents, the roof, and other minor repairs. Escrow was held up and couldn't close due to her not willing to sign the lien release and XXXX other documents.. Id like to file suit as it seems as theres no other option to sell and get the correct payout. 



Then I tried again to sell on XX/XX/XXXX, it was in escrow that day for $ XXXX with $ XXXX in credit for repairs to the buyer. And yet again, she was unwilling to sign the XXXX necessary papers escrow was asking her for. She hed up escrow for 2 months and said that she needs the money in her hands and then she will sign all the necessary documents needed. XXXX told her it doesnt work that way.She stated Wire me the $ XXXX and I will handle the rest of the paperwork after the money is in my bank account. It's apparent I have been dealing with someone not normal over the past few years. 



A demand letter was sent XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX to no avail. 



I was in a XXXX escrow for myself ( replacement home ) and they threatened to keep my earnest money deposit of {$27000.00} because I couldn't close on it as I needed a small amount of funds from the departing residence in order to have enough down payment. Thankfully I was still able to close on my home now, the lender adjusted my down payment. 



Then in XX/XX/XXXX, I am tired and I would love to sell this home because the whole situation is awful, evil, and toxic. But how can I sell it when she won't sign the lien release? 



I have made XXXX payments and I owed a [ proximately $ XXXX on my home. My last payment I made was XX/XX/XXXX. 



I also tried to refinance the home in XX/XX/XXXX with lender XXXX XXXX to get her off the loan and to have a clean title and she told the lender to ( excuse this language but ) XXXXXXXX XXXX  is what she told him, she was really evil and awful. 



She even sent a wrong "" balloon payment '' to me less than a year from purchasing the home with the wrong amount owed. See attached. 



She even fraudulently tried to charge me for gardening fees when there was no gardener at the time and I hired my own. She is trying to charge me $ XXXX for XXXX furniture that I begged her to pick up and sent her a letter to pick it up in 30 days as well as other things we did not agree to such as interest fees, etc. 



She is unfortunately a criminal and most likely saw me as a young single mom, I dont typically have a victim mentally but when you see the attachments you will see why I feel targeted by her. I will attach everything I have as proof. I have XXXX Exhibits but I am only sending XXXX attachements so I do not burden you. I am so tired. So many people know of the situation and even the buyer 's agent on XXXX of the transactions said they are going to complain to the lender so I am not shocked that XXXX XXXX accelerated the loan and I sold MY house. She finally agreed and signed all paperwork in escrow because the lender called her out for all of her wrong doings and they threatened to criminalize her, I have this letter as well. I have been a target and a threat since I met her and bought my home in XX/XX/XXXX. This person is unethical and is not to be trusted. 



Please mail my money back to me in a form of a cashiers check.

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Violation of Consumer Protection Laws : CFPB Failure to Enforce Statutory Rights Against XXXX, EXP, and XXXX I am submitting a formal complaint against the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) for failing to enforce federal consumer protection laws against XXXX ( XXXX ), Experian ( EXP ), & XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), despite multiple complaints regarding unauthorized reporting of my personal information. 
Background : As a federally protected consumer, I have the right to ensure my personal information is handled per federal laws. However, XXXX, EXP, & XXXX have reported an account without my consent, violating my statutory rights. I have repeatedly requested proof of consent to this reporting, but none have provided such proof. Despite contacting the CFPB, no enforcement action was taken. 
Jurisdiction of CFPB Over CRAs : The CFPB has direct jurisdiction over CRAs such as XXXX, EXP, and financial institutions like XXXX ( 15 U.S.C. 6805 ). The CFPB is responsible for enforcing compliance with FCRA, GLBA, and the Privacy Act of 1974. These laws ensure CRAs protect consumers nonpublic personal information and maintain accurate reporting.

Failure of CFPB to Enforce Permissible Purpose Laws : Despite the CFPB 's statutory duty, it has failed to enforce 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which mandates that consumer information can only be reported with written consumer consent or for permissible purposes. I have repeatedly requested proof of my consent to this reporting, but no such proof has been provided. The CFPB has not taken the necessary action to stop these unlawful practices.

Failure to Enforce Opt-Out Rights : Under 16 C.F.R. 313.7, I have the right to opt out of nonpublic information being shared with third parties. Despite this, XXXX, EXP, & XXXX continue to report my information without offering me an option to opt out, violating 15 U.S.C. 6802. The CFPB has ignored its responsibility to enforce these protections, allowing these companies to continue violating my rights.

CFPBs Role in Protecting Consumer Rights : Per 15 U.S.C. 6801 ( GLBA ), financial institutions and CRAs must protect the confidentiality of nonpublic personal informationXXXX XXXX, EXP, & XXXX have failed to comply, reporting my information without proper consent. The CFPB, responsible for overseeing and enforcing this protection, has neglected its responsibility to act. 
Violation of Privacy Act of 1974 : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) ensures that personal information, including SSNs, is handled with strict confidentiality. XXXX, EXP & XXXX have reported my SSN without my consent, violating this federal law. The CFPB has failed to enforce the Privacy Act, allowing these companies to breach my privacy rights. 
Precedent and Accountability : In similar cases, such as FTC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, courts have ruled that CRAs and financial institutions must comply with federal laws. The CFPB has the legal obligation to enforce such rulings. Failure to do so not only disregards federal statutes but also sets a dangerous precedent for future violations. 
Harm and Urgency : These unlawful reporting practices have caused significant financial and emotional harm, including a decline in my credit score, denial of credit, and continued privacy violations. This issue has been ongoing since XXXX, and immediate action is necessary to prevent further damage. 
Company Policies Do Not Supersede Federal Law : When I contacted XXXX, EXP, & XXXX regarding this issue, they claimed their policies allowed them to report my information without consent and that the laws protecting my opt-out rights do not apply. This is untrue. Federal laws such as the FCRA, GLBA, and the Privacy Act supersede internal policies. The CFPBs failure to act allows these companies to continue violating my rights. 
Breach of Statutory Duty : The CFPB has a legal responsibility to enforce consumer protection laws. By neglecting its duty to act against the violations committed by XXXX, EXP, & XXXX, the CFPB has breached its statutory duty under federal law. This breach allows ongoing harm to consumers, undermining the integrity of these legal protections. 
CFPBs Inaction and Breach of Duty : The CFPB, mandated by Congress to enforce these laws, has failed in its duty. Should the CFPB continue to fail in enforcing these laws, I will explore additional legal remedies to compel enforcement and protect my rights. I reserve the right to escalate this issue to congressional representatives for oversight and raise public awareness through consumer protection groups and media channels. 
Conclusion : The CFPBs failure to act has allowed XXXX, EXP, & XXXX to continue violating federal consumer protection laws. I am formally requesting the CFPB immediately enforce the relevant statutes, cease the continued reporting of my information, and impose the necessary sanctions. If the CFPB fails to take immediate action, I will pursue further steps, including legal action and escalating this issue to Congress and the public. See CFPB complaint # XXXX the last time these issues were brought to your attention and the policies not enforced. At that time it appears that the CFPB was engaging in an abrogation of responsibility. I trust that this will not be the case in this instance, as I expect the CFPB to fulfill its mandated duties.

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Subject : Failure to Provide Proper Validation and Verification of Disputed Credit Report Items Dear CFPB, I am filing this complaint to address the failure of both XXXX and certain collection agencies to provide the required validation and verification documentation for several accounts I disputed. Despite my attempts to resolve these disputes through the proper channels, I was not provided with the appropriate validation of these debts, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Details of the Complaint : 1. Collection Agency : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Original Creditor : Progressive Original Amount : {$290.00} Dispute Outcome : Verified as accurate, but no supporting validation or verification documents were provided. 
Despite my dispute, I was informed that this account "" belongs to me '' without any proof, such as a signed contract or a detailed statement outlining the debt. 
2. Collection Agency : Sequoia XXXX XXXX. 
Account Numbers : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
Original Amounts : {$40.00}, {$130.00}, {$39.00} ( balance amounts updated to {$49.00}, {$170.00}, and {$53.00}, respectively ) Dispute Outcome : Verified as accurate, with some fields updated, but no supporting validation documents were provided. These utility accounts were reported as being delinquent, but the collection agency failed to provide any original agreements, billing details, or verification showing that I owe these amounts. 
3. Deletion of Items by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Account Numbers : XXXX and XXXX Dispute Outcome : These items were deleted after investigation, which implies that these debts were likely unverifiable. 
While this is a step in the right direction, it further demonstrates the overall lack of diligence in verifying the accuracy of items on my credit report. 
My Complaint : In each of these cases, I requested proper validation and verification of the debts in accordance with my rights under the FCRA and FDCPA. However, I was not provided with any documentation proving the validity of the debts, such as : Original contracts or signed agreements. 
Billing statements showing the origin of the debt and the amounts. 
Proof that these debts were legitimately assigned or sold to the collection agencies. 
Instead, the reporting agencies and collection agencies merely "" verified '' the debts without offering any tangible proof or explanation. This practice violates my rights as a consumer to verify the accuracy of debts that are negatively impacting my credit report. 

Action Requested : I request that the CFPB : Investigate the failure of XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and Sequoia XXXX XXXX to provide the required validation and verification documentation. 
Ensure that these disputed items are either validated with proper documentation or removed from my credit report. 
Provide any remedies available under the FCRA and FDCPA for non-compliance, including removing unverifiable accounts from my report. 
I have attached a copy of the dispute results from XXXX for your reference. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me if additional information or documentation is required.

As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning me in my consumer file. 
Despite previous disputes, the following accounts continue to reflect incorrect details. I urge you to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation to determine the accuracy of this information and delete the inaccurate items from my consumer file. 
Account Name/Account Number : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX / [ Account Number XXXX ] Inaccuracy : There are significant discrepancies in the reporting of the account information across different credit bureaus, particularly concerning payment history, balance details, and account status. 
Specifics : High Balance : XXXX reports a high balance of {$13000.00}, while Experian reports {$0.00}. This inconsistency suggests that the high balance information has not been accurately updated across bureaus. 
Last Verified Date : XXXX lists the last verified date as XX/XX/XXXX, but Experian does not report a verification date. This lack of consistency indicates that the account verification process may not have been applied uniformly. 
Date of Last Activity : Both XXXX and Experian report the date of last activity as XX/XX/XXXX ; however, the subsequent account activity reported by XXXX suggests ongoing discrepancies. The last activity date should be accurately verified. 
Date Reported : XXXX reports the date as XX/XX/XXXX, while Experian lists it as XX/XX/XXXX. The accurate date reported should be consistent across both bureaus. 
Balance Owed : Both XXXX and Experian show a balance owed of {$0.00}, but the payment history and account status suggest discrepancies in how this account was closed or charged off. This needs to be verified and corrected. 
Closed Date : XXXX reports a closed date of XX/XX/XXXX, but Experian does not provide a closed date. The closed date should be consistent and accurate across all reports. 
Account Status : Both bureaus report the account as "" Paid, '' but XXXX includes the remark "" Payment after charge off/collection '' and "" Canceled by credit grantor, '' while Experian states, "" Account has been closed due to inactivity '' and "" Unpaid balance reported as a loss by credit grantor. '' These differences in status and remarks should be reconciled and accurately reflected in all reports. 
Payment History : Experian reports delinquencies ( 30 days late in March 2024, 60 days late in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, etc. ), while XXXX shows no late payments reported. This discrepancy in payment history should be thoroughly investigated and corrected. 
Days Late - 7 Year History : XXXX reports no late payments, while Experian reports late payments in multiple months. This inconsistency must be addressed to ensure the accurate reporting of the payment history. 

Action Requested : Please conduct a comprehensive reinvestigation to ensure that all details, including the high balance, payment history, account status, and remarks, are accurately and consistently reported across all three credit bureaus. Any inaccuracies or inconsistencies should be corrected or deleted from my consumer file as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
You have 15 days from the receipt of this letter to conduct a reasonable investigation and rectify the inaccuracies as required by law. I expect all necessary changes to be made to my consumer file and for these changes to be forwarded to me at the address provided above. 
Please consider this my formal request for a reinvestigation and ensure that the inaccuracies are corrected promptly. I look forward to receiving confirmation of the changes made to my file.

Closed Date : TransUnion reports a closed date of XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX does not provide a closed date. The closed date should be consistent and accurate across all reports. 
Account Status : Both bureaus report the account as "" Paid, '' but TransUnion includes the remark "" Payment after charge off/collection '' and "" Canceled by credit grantor, '' while XXXX states, "" Account has been closed due to inactivity '' and "" Unpaid balance reported as a loss by credit grantor. '' These differences in status and remarks should be reconciled and accurately reflected in all reports. 
Payment History : XXXX reports delinquencies ( 30 days late in XXXX XXXX 60 days late in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, etc. ), while TransUnion shows no late payments reported. This discrepancy in payment history should be thoroughly investigated and corrected. 
Days Late - 7 Year History : TransUnion reports no late payments, while XXXX reports late payments in multiple months. This inconsistency must be addressed to ensure the accurate reporting of the payment history. 

Action Requested : Please conduct a comprehensive reinvestigation to ensure that all details, including the high balance, payment history, account status, and remarks, are accurately and consistently reported across all three credit bureaus. Any inaccuracies or inconsistencies should be corrected or deleted from my consumer file as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning me in my consumer file. 
Despite previous disputes, the following accounts continue to reflect incorrect details. I urge you to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation to determine the accuracy of this information and delete the inaccurate items from my consumer file. 
Account Name/Account Number : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX / [ Account Number XXXX ] Inaccuracy : There are significant discrepancies in the reporting of the account information across different credit bureaus, particularly concerning payment history, balance details, and account status. 
Specifics : High Balance : TransUnion reports a high balance of {$13000.00}, while XXXX reports {$0.00}. This inconsistency suggests that the high balance information has not been accurately updated across bureaus. 
Last Verified Date : TransUnion lists the last verified date as XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX does not report a verification date. This lack of consistency indicates that the account verification process may not have been applied uniformly. 
Date of Last Activity : Both TransUnion and XXXX report the date of last activity as XX/XX/XXXX ; however, the subsequent account activity reported by TransUnion suggests ongoing discrepancies. The last activity date should be accurately verified. 
Date Reported : TransUnion reports the date as XX/XX/XXXX, while XXXX lists it as XX/XX/XXXX. The accurate date reported should be consistent across both bureaus. 
Balance Owed : Both TransUnion and XXXX show a balance owed of {$0.00}, but the payment history and account status suggest discrepancies in how this account was closed or charged off. This needs to be verified and corrected. 
Closed Date : TransUnion reports a closed date of XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX does not provide a closed date. The closed date should be consistent and accurate across all reports. 
Account Status : Both bureaus report the account as "" Paid, '' but TransUnion includes the remark "" Payment after charge off/collection '' and "" Canceled by credit grantor, '' while XXXX states, "" Account has been closed due to inactivity '' and "" Unpaid balance reported as a loss by credit grantor. '' These differences in status and remarks should be reconciled and accurately reflected in all reports. 
Payment History : XXXX reports delinquencies ( 30 days late in XXXX XXXX, 60 days late in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, etc. ), while TransUnion shows no late payments reported. This discrepancy in payment history should be thoroughly investigated and corrected. 
Days Late - 7 Year History : TransUnion reports no late payments, while XXXX reports late payments in multiple months. This inconsistency must be addressed to ensure the accurate reporting of the payment history.

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Subject : Failure to Provide Proper Validation and Verification of Disputed Credit Report Items Dear CFPB, I am filing this complaint to address the failure of both XXXX and certain collection agencies to provide the required validation and verification documentation for several accounts I disputed. Despite my attempts to resolve these disputes through the proper channels, I was not provided with the appropriate validation of these debts, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Details of the Complaint : 1. Collection Agency : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Original Creditor : Progressive Original Amount : {$290.00} Dispute Outcome : Verified as accurate, but no supporting validation or verification documents were provided. 
Despite my dispute, I was informed that this account "" belongs to me '' without any proof, such as a signed contract or a detailed statement outlining the debt. 
2. Collection Agency : XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Account Numbers : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
Original Amounts : {$40.00}, {$130.00}, {$39.00} ( balance amounts updated to {$49.00}, {$170.00}, and {$53.00}, respectively ) Dispute Outcome : Verified as accurate, with some fields updated, but no supporting validation documents were provided. These utility accounts were reported as being delinquent, but the collection agency failed to provide any original agreements, billing details, or verification showing that I owe these amounts. 
XXXX. Deletion of Items by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Account Numbers : XXXX and XXXX Dispute Outcome : These items were deleted after investigation, which implies that these debts were likely unverifiable. 
While this is a step in the right direction, it further demonstrates the overall lack of diligence in verifying the accuracy of items on my credit report. 
My Complaint : In each of these cases, I requested proper validation and verification of the debts in accordance with my rights under the FCRA and FDCPA. However, I was not provided with any documentation proving the validity of the debts, such as : Original contracts or signed agreements. 
Billing statements showing the origin of the debt and the amounts. 
Proof that these debts were legitimately assigned or sold to the collection agencies. 
Instead, the reporting agencies and collection agencies merely "" verified '' the debts without offering any tangible proof or explanation. This practice violates my rights as a consumer to verify the accuracy of debts that are negatively impacting my credit report. 

Action Requested : I request that the CFPB : Investigate the failure of XXXX, Credit Collections, and XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide the required validation and verification documentation. 
Ensure that these disputed items are either validated with proper documentation or removed from my credit report. 
Provide any remedies available under the FCRA and FDCPA for non-compliance, including removing unverifiable accounts from my report. 
I have attached a copy of the dispute results from XXXX for your reference. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me if additional information or documentation is required.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX MN XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2024 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Subject : Pre-Arbitration Notice Regarding Incorrect Reporting of Late Payments Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate reporting of late payments on my credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically under sections 15 U.S.C. 1681 and 15 U.S.C. 1666b. 

I have recently reviewed my credit report and noticed that several accounts are reflecting late payments that I believe are inaccurate. As you are well aware, the FCRA mandates that all information on a credit report must be both fair and accurate. Incorrect reporting of late payments can have severe and long-lasting impacts on my credit score, potentially affecting my ability to secure loans, credit, housing, and even employment. 

It is crucial to me that my credit report accurately reflects my payment history. I am requesting an immediate investigation and correction of these inaccuracies. Enclosed are copies of supporting documents that substantiate my claim that these late payments were either inaccurately reported or never occurred. 

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to pursue legal action to protect my rights under the FCRA. This could include filing a lawsuit to seek damages, legal costs, and attorney fees as permitted under the law. 

To provide clarity on the potential legal costs, here is a breakdown : Attorney Fees : Depending on the complexity of the case, attorney fees could range from {$200.00} to {$500.00} per hour. In a straightforward case, this could amount to {$2000.00} to {$10000.00}. 
Court Filing Fees : Filing a lawsuit typically incurs a fee ranging from {$100.00} to {$500.00}, depending on the jurisdiction. 
Other Legal Costs : Additional costs such as deposition fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses could add another {$1000.00} to {$5000.00} to the total cost. 
I hope we can avoid these unnecessary costs by resolving this matter promptly. Please confirm the receipt of this letter and initiate the investigation into my dispute. I expect a timely response as outlined in the FCRA, and I look forward to a fair resolution. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this important matter.

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Violation of Consumer Protection Laws : CFPB Failure to Enforce Statutory Rights Against EXQ, XXXX, and XXXX I am submitting a formal complaint against the Consumer Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) for failing to enforce federal consumer protection laws against Equifax ( EXQ ), XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), despite multiple complaints regarding unauthorized reporting of my personal information. 
Background : As a federally protected consumer, I have the right to ensure my personal information is handled per federal laws. However, EXQ, XXXX, & XXXX have reported an account without my consent, violating my statutory rights. I have repeatedly requested proof of consent to this reporting, but none have provided such proof. Despite contacting the CFPB, no enforcement action was taken. 
Jurisdiction of CFPB Over CRAs : The CFPB has direct jurisdiction over CRAs such as EXQ, XXXX, and financial institutions like XXXX ( 15 U.S.C. 6805 ). The CFPB is responsible for enforcing compliance with FCRA, GLBA, and the Privacy Act of 1974. These laws ensure CRAs protect consumers nonpublic personal information and maintain accurate reporting.

Failure of CFPB to Enforce Permissible Purpose Laws : Despite the CFPB 's statutory duty, it has failed to enforce 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which mandates that consumer information can only be reported with written consumer consent or for permissible purposes. I have repeatedly requested proof of my consent to this reporting, but no such proof has been provided. The CFPB has not taken the necessary action to stop these unlawful practices. 
Failure to Enforce Opt-Out Rights : Under 16 C.F.R. 313.7, I have the right to opt out of nonpublic information being shared with third parties. Despite this, EXQ, XXXX, & XXXX continue to report my information without offering me an option to opt out, violating 15 U.S.C. 6802. The CFPB has ignored its responsibility to enforce these protections, allowing these companies to continue violating my rights.

CFPBs Role in Protecting Consumer Rights : Per 15 U.S.C. 6801 ( GLBA ), financial institutions and CRAs must protect the confidentiality of nonpublic personal information. EXQ, XXXX, & XXXX have failed to comply, reporting my information without proper consent. The CFPB, responsible for overseeing and enforcing this protection, has neglected its responsibility to act. 
Violation of Privacy Act of 1974 : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) ensures that personal information, including SSNs, is handled with strict confidentiality. EXQ, XXXX & XXXX have reported my SSN without my consent, violating this federal law. The CFPB has failed to enforce the Privacy Act, allowing these companies to breach my privacy rights. 
Precedent and Accountability : In similar cases, such as FTC v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, courts have ruled that CRAs and financial institutions must comply with federal laws. The CFPB has the legal obligation to enforce such rulings. Failure to do so not only disregards federal statutes but also sets a dangerous precedent for future violations. 
Harm and Urgency : These unlawful reporting practices have caused significant financial and emotional harm, including a decline in my credit score, denial of credit, and continued privacy violations. This issue has been ongoing since XXXX, and immediate action is necessary to prevent further damage. 
Company Policies Do Not Supersede Federal Law : When I contacted EXQ, XXXX, & XXXX regarding this issue, they claimed their policies allowed them to report my information without consent and that the laws protecting my opt-out rights do not apply. This is untrue. Federal laws such as the FCRA, GLBA, and the Privacy Act supersede internal policies. The CFPBs failure to act allows these companies to continue violating my rights. 
Breach of Statutory Duty : The CFPB has a legal responsibility to enforce consumer protection laws. By neglecting its duty to act against the violations committed by EXQ, XXXX, & XXXX, the CFPB has breached its statutory duty under federal law. This breach allows ongoing harm to consumers, undermining the integrity of these legal protections. 
CFPBs Inaction and Breach of Duty : The CFPB, mandated by Congress to enforce these laws, has failed in its duty. Should the CFPB continue to fail in enforcing these laws, I will explore additional legal remedies to compel enforcement and protect my rights. I reserve the right to escalate this issue to congressional representatives for oversight and raise public awareness through consumer protection groups and media channels. 
Conclusion : The CFPBs failure to act has allowed EXQ, XXXX, & XXXX to continue violating federal consumer protection laws. I am formally requesting the CFPB immediately enforce the relevant statutes, cease the continued reporting of my information, and impose the necessary sanctions. If the CFPB fails to take immediate action, I will pursue further steps, including legal action and escalating this issue to Congress and the public. See CFPB complaint # XXXX the last time these issues were brought to your attention and the policies not enforced. At that time it appears that the CFPB was engaging in an abrogation of responsibility. I trust that this will not be the case in this instance, as I expect the CFPB to fulfill its mandated duties. Should the CFPB fail to take appropriate action, I will pursue all available avenues to ensure accountability and enforcement of my rights under federal law.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",VA,23320,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10034932

My name is XXXX XXXX, and my file number is XXXX. 

**Background : ** On XX/XX/year>, I received an unsatisfactory and unsupported response from TransUnion concerning my request to block fraudulent inquiries. TransUnion incorrectly declined to block inquiries made by XXXX ( XX/XX/year> ) and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XX/XX/year> ), claiming that the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report I submitted was not a valid document. This decision is inconsistent with the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and California state laws. 

**Specific Issues : ** 1. **Refusal to Block Fraudulent Inquiries : ** Despite providing a valid FTC Identity Theft Report ( Report Number : XXXX ), which complies with both federal and state laws, TransUnion refused to block the fraudulent inquiries. This refusal violates FCRA Section 605B and California Civil Code 1798.92.

2. **Inadequate Phone Assistance : ** I have attempted to follow up on this issue via phone. During these calls, representatives disconnected the line, refused assistance, and provided misleading information about protocols and procedures. This pattern of behavior has included : - Representatives disconnecting calls without resolution. 
- Misleading statements regarding dispute processes. 
- Refusal to acknowledge or act upon the valid documentation I provided. 

**Violation of Federal and State Laws : ** - **Federal Law ( FCRA, Section 605B ) : ** Under FCRA, TransUnion is obligated to block fraudulent information when provided with a valid FTC Identity Theft Report. Their refusal to comply violates this requirement.

- **California State Law : ** The California Identity Theft Act mandates that credit reporting agencies must promptly investigate and block fraudulent accounts upon receiving proper documentation. TransUnion 's failure to act on the FTC Identity Theft Report contravenes this law as well.

The continued presence of these inquiries on my credit report is harming my credit standing and financial opportunities. 

**Actions Requested : ** I request the CFPB to intervene and compel TransUnion to : 1. Immediately block the fraudulent inquiries from XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
2. Comply with FCRA Section 605B and California Civil Code 1798.92.

3. Provide a detailed explanation of their investigation methods, including all communications with XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, and any other relevant parties. 
4. Provide me with an updated credit report reflecting the removal of the fraudulent inquiries. 
5. Ensure that TransUnion ceases further violations of my consumer rights under federal and state laws.

As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning me in my consumer file. 
Despite previous disputes, the following accounts continue to reflect incorrect details. I urge you to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation to determine the accuracy of this information and delete the inaccurate items from my consumer file. 
Account Name/Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX / [ Account Number XXXX ] Inaccuracy : There are significant discrepancies in the reporting of the account information across different credit bureaus, particularly concerning payment history, balance details, and account status. 
Specifics : High Balance : TXXXX reports a high balance of {$13000.00}, while Experian reports {$0.00}. This inconsistency suggests that the high balance information has not been accurately updated across bureaus. 
Last Verified Date : XXXX lists the last verified date as XX/XX/XXXX, but Experian does not report a verification date. This lack of consistency indicates that the account verification process may not have been applied uniformly. 
Date of Last Activity : Both XXXX and Experian report the date of last activity as XX/XX/XXXX ; however, the subsequent account activity reported by XXXX suggests ongoing discrepancies. The last activity date should be accurately verified. 
Date Reported : XXXX reports the date as XX/XX/XXXX, while Experian lists it as XX/XX/XXXX. The accurate date reported should be consistent across both bureaus. 
XXXX Owed : Both XXXX and Experian show a balance owed of {$0.00}, but the payment history and account status suggest discrepancies in how this account was closed or charged off. This needs to be verified and corrected. 
Closed Date : XXXX reports a closed date of XX/XX/XXXX, but Experian does not provide a closed date. The closed date should be consistent and accurate across all reports. 
Account Status : Both bureaus report the account as "" Paid, '' but XXXX includes the remark "" Payment after charge off/collection '' and "" Canceled by credit grantor, '' while Experian states, "" Account has been closed due to inactivity '' and "" Unpaid balance reported as a loss by credit grantor. '' These differences in status and remarks should be reconciled and accurately reflected in all reports. 
Payment History : Experian reports delinquencies ( 30 days late in XXXX XXXX, 60 days late in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, etc. ), while XXXX shows no late payments reported. This discrepancy in payment history should be thoroughly investigated and corrected. 
Days Late - 7 Year History : XXXX reports no late payments, while Experian reports late payments in multiple months. This inconsistency must be addressed to ensure the accurate reporting of the payment history. 

Action Requested : Please conduct a comprehensive reinvestigation to ensure that all details, including the high balance, payment history, account status, and remarks, are accurately and consistently reported across all three credit bureaus. Any inaccuracies or inconsistencies should be corrected or deleted from my consumer file as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
You have 15 days from the receipt of this letter to conduct a reasonable investigation and rectify the inaccuracies as required by law. I expect all necessary changes to be made to my consumer file and for these changes to be forwarded to me at the address provided above. 
Please consider this my formal request for a reinvestigation and ensure that the inaccuracies are corrected promptly. I look forward to receiving confirmation of the changes made to my file. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Despite multiple requests, these fraudulent accounts remain, damaging my credit and personal reputation. 

On XX/XX/year>, while applying for the Alaska Permanent Dividend Fund ( PFD ), I encountered a serious glitch on their website. As I was submitting my application, the page refreshed and began displaying another individuals personal information. This included their address, date of birth, Social Security number, and bank account details. 

On that same day, I received two phone calls from individuals who had seen my personal information on the PFD website during the glitch. They confirmed that they had access to all of my private information. 

Soon after this data breach, fraudulent accounts began appearing in my name, clearly using the information that was leaked through the PFD website. I did not authorize the use of my personal information in any form, and my identity was stolen to create these fraudulent accounts. 

I demand that XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX immediately remove these fraudulent accounts from my credit reports. This is my last warning, and I would prefer to resolve this matter peacefully, without the need for court intervention. However, if this issue is not resolved promptly, I will take legal action.

I request your intervention to ensure compliance with the appropriate regulations governing accurate and fair credit reporting. 

Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), creditors and financial institutions are legally required to report accurate and timely information to credit reporting agencies. According to the law : Accuracy of Information ( 1681s-2 ( a ) ) : Furnishers of credit information are required to report accurate information to credit reporting agencies. If inaccurate information is identified, it must be corrected promptly.

Duty to Correct and Update Information ( 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) : Furnishers must correct and update information when they become aware that previously provided information is inaccurate or incomplete.

Reasonable Investigation ( 1681s-2 ( b ) ) : When a consumer disputes the accuracy of reported information, creditors must conduct a reasonable investigation and provide corrections if inaccuracies are found. 
Based on my review, [ insert specific details about the late payment reporting, such as the dates and nature of the incorrect reporting ], I believe this information needs to be more accurate and align with the requirements outlined in the FCRA. This inaccurate reporting negatively impacts my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 

I request that the CFPB investigate this matter to ensure that [ creditor/financial institution ] complies with the FCRAs requirements. Specifically, I ask that they be directed to : Correct any inaccuracies in my credit report related to the late payment. 
Ensure all future reporting adheres strictly to FCRA standards. 
Provide written confirmation of the actions taken to correct these inaccuracies.

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Procedures in case of disputed accuracy ), you are required to conduct a reasonable investigation when a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information on their credit report. I have not received proper written notice of the results of any investigation, which is a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( Notification of results of reinvestigation ).

Furthermore, I question how you can verify that these accounts truly belong to me if you are not conducting a thorough investigation. If you can not provide documented proof of these accounts validity, you are legally obligated to remove them from my credit report under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( Requirement to delete or modify information that can not be verified ). 

Additionally, I request that you remove any hard inquiries not associated with an open account, particularly those made within the last six months. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( Permissible purposes of consumer reports ), inquiries can only be made with my explicit consent, and I have not applied for new credit recently. With the recent nationwide data breach in which my Social Security number was exposed, its possible that credit was applied for in my name without my knowledge.

Lastly, please ensure the removal of any duplicate information from my credit report, as accuracy is required under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( Compliance procedures ).

I trust you will follow the law and promptly investigate and correct the errors in my credit report. Failure to comply may result in further action to protect my rights.

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX this account that was paid in full. The account should reflect a XXXX balance, yet it continues to report an outstanding balance, which is inaccurate. 

If the credit bureaus or the creditor are unable to update the information to accurately reflect the paid status, I request that the account be removed or deleted from my credit report, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding TransUnion 's fraudulent reporting practices that have caused significant harm to me. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from TransUnion confirming the removal of six fraudulent accounts from my consumer report. However, on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX was re-added to my report without my knowledge or consent. Similarly, on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX appeared on my report, again without notice or written authorization from me.

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I made several attempts to contact TransUnion regarding these unauthorized changes. Despite multiple calls, I only received one callback. During this callback, I spoke to a representative named XXXX XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX. XXXX reviewed my consumer report and noted that these accounts were not reflected in his system at that time. After updating his system, he acknowledged that these accounts should not have been added without my explicit written consent and assured me that they would be removed immediately. He then transferred me to another representative named XXXX at XXXX XXXX 

XXXX refused to provide her employee ID number and falsely claimed that she was unable to do so. She also refused to provide any documentation or explanation as to why these accounts were re-added to my consumer report without my permission. Furthermore, she stated that I have no control over what is reported on my consumer file, claiming that creditors own and control what is reported, and that consumer protection laws are designed to be used against me rather than to protect my rights. This interaction was highly distressing and has further compounded the emotional, mental, and physical harm I have suffered as a result of TransUnions actions over the past 10 months. 

I have previously notified TransUnion of four data breaches in which my personal information was compromised. I have submitted reports to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), filed identity theft reports, provided police reports, affidavits of truth, and a power of attorney that overrides any and all permissions. Despite these measures, TransUnion continues to act in violation of my consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ), and the Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ).

TransUnions repeated failures to address these issues, and their unauthorized and fraudulent actions, have caused me severe distress. Their practices are in clear violation of federal consumer protection laws, including the FCRA, which governs the proper handling and accuracy of consumer reports. I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and hold TransUnion accountable for its continued violation of my rights.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,78259,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10037112

Be advised that your claim is disputed and validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt is requested in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692 and as amended by adding the following new Title 8 USC 802 et seq., and the Fair Credit Billing Act, 15 USC. 1666 et seq. All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq. It is not now, nor has it ever been, my intention to avoid paying any obligation that is lawfully owed by the Claimant. I refuse to pay this alleged debt until the proper validation of this debt is provided. Please cease and desist all collection activities until you can properly validate this alleged debt.

15 USC1692c ( c ) Ceasing communication If a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that the consumer refuses to pay a debt or that the consumer wishes the debt collector to cease further communication with the consumer, the debt collector shall not communicate further with the consumer with respect to such debt.

If proper validation of this alleged debt is not provided within 30 calendar days of receiving this notice, I will assume this alleged debt to be invalid and you shall delete this account and stop all collection activities regarding this account. In order to make arrangements to pay an obligation which may be lawfully owed, please document and verify the debt by complying, in good faith, with this request for validation and return it to me, within thirty ( 30 ) days of receipt of this letter.

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of Claimant mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION and PROOF OF CLAIM made pursuant to the above-named Titles and Sections. I respectfully request that your offices provide Claimant with competent evidence as per the attached Declaration and Proof of Claim that I have any legal obligation to pay you the unsubstantiated alleged debt.

Provide under Rule 1002. Requirement of the Original An original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides otherwise.

Furthermore, you shall cease all verbal communication. No phone calls, no text messages, no social media contact, no ringless voicemail contact, no email contact, the only communication must be through the UNITED STATES POST OFFICE, to the Claimant.

At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Consumer reporting agencies, such as, XXXX, XXXX and TransUnion prior to validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt, this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact ; if any negative mark is found on any of Claimant consumer reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you and your client for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character Violation of United States Code TITLE 18 PART 1 CHAPTER 63 1341 ( Mail Fraud ) This debt is considered to be invalid until I receive proper validation and your offices provide Claimant with proof of claim of the disputed debt. Your offices have 30 days to produce the required documentation in accordance with FTC guidelines. During this validation period and proof of claim, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of Claimant consumer reports, said action will be considered a dishonor and cause the self-executing contract portion of this notice to be implemented. This includes any listing any information to a consumer reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated.

If your offices fail to respond to this validation and proof of claim request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from Claimant credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to Claimant immediately.

Title 8 USC 809. Validation of debts [ 15 USC 1692g ] ( b ) If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection ( a ) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or any copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector.

XXXX is also wrongfully holding a check from my home insurance company to finish the repair of my home as they said that I was not current on my mortgage which I was and I am attaching the letter to prove so. 

Also in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX XXXX and Experian show me as 30 days delinquent and XXXX is reporting me as 60 days delinquent on each occurence.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are legally required to report only accurate and verifiable information. Failure to comply with FCRA Section 611 mandates the removal or correction of inaccurate information within 30 days. 

Due to the recent XXXX XX/XX/XXXX data breach, which exposed sensitive consumer data, it is imperative that my information be handled with utmost care to mitigate risks of identity theft and fraud. 

Discrepancies in Reporting : XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account, under account number XXXX, exhibits significant inconsistencies : XXXX. Conflicting Status Update Dates : XXXX report lists a charge-off status update in XX/XX/XXXX, while another lists it in XX/XX/XXXX.

Expectations for Resolution : An immediate investigation into this account is mandatory. Provide verifiable proof that this debt is mine and accurate, or remove this item from my credit report. 

Failure to resolve this matter within 30 days will result in : XXXX. Filing formal complaints with the CFPB and FTC.

Subsquently there was addition information that need to be added. So call cfpb and spoke with a representative who indicated I make out a new report. What follow is the new additional information Starting in XX/XX/2024 I started to receive phone calls from a company identified as XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). My cell phone identified the calls as SCAM, so I did not respond/answer. Calls from XXXX continued through XXXX and early XXXX. Each time I received a call from XXXX the identified phone number was different. This continued to support my thinking that it was a SCAM. Never did anyone that called from XXXX leave a voice message about why they were calling. On XX/XX/2024, I received a text message on my cell phone from XXXX. At this point I went and looked up XXXX on the internet and found they are debt collection agency. 

Being concerned that some debt fraud might be occurring for me I contacted XXXX from the phone number found on the internet. In calling XXXX I identified myself and the XXXX representative indicated that I had a debt with PayPal for {$21000.00} through a XXXX XXXX with XXXX Bank. I informed the representative that I have no XXXX XXXX with XXXX Bank. Further I indicated that I have never banked with XXXX XXXX. I asked what information they had from the XXXX Bank. The XXXX representative did identify that last XXXX digits of the XXXX XXXX  as XXXX and a residential address of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I informed the representative that this was not my address and never has been since I live in Washington. I was not willing to provide XXXX further personal information about myself. I did ask the XXXX representative I can correct this error. The XXXX representative indicated he would file a dispute resolution and that I could respond to it when it would be mailed to me in XXXX to 10 days. I asked a XXXX representative for XXXX Dispute phone number which he provided but indicate I would need to call the next day since given the time the office would be closed. 

Following the call with XXXX I call XXXXXXXX XXXX  and spoke with a representative. The representative was able to confirm the information that XXXX had provided me. I had indicated to the XXXX representative that I have never bank with them. XXXX XXXX XXXX representative asked for my personal information, address and XXXX XXXX. I was reluctant to provide the representative this information, but she assured me it was to help verify if the information on their account was the same. Being concerned that my personal information was exposed I did provide the representative with the information. In turn she was able to confirm that the information in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was not my SS # or my address. XXXX XXXX XXXX  representative did indicate she would open a case on this as fraud and that I would receive a notice. The call with XXXXXXXX XXXX  was then terminated. 

After contacting XXXX XXXX  I call PayPal. I informed PayPal representative of the above information. I found PayPal representative not very helpful, and he only indicated that it maybe another person with my same name but he would report this to the higher-ups I might note that I do have a PayPal account which has a single credit card not with XXXX XXXX  XXXX This PayPal account is used infrequently. I check this account routinely and there has never been any fraudulent or illegal activity against it. 

On XX/XX/2024, I called XXXX XXXX department and spoke to a representative. The representative was able to confirm that I had called their service yesterday. I ask the representative how they obtain my cell phone since my personal information was not listed on XXXX XXXX XXXX account initially to start contact me assuming it was me that owned the debt. The XXXX representative could not initially indicate how that occurred. The representative was then able identified my SS # and address in their system. She indicated my personal information was now listed on the XXXXXXXX XXXX. I was upset that XXXX now had my personal information. I asked XXXX representative when my personal information was entered in the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX She confirmed that my personal information was entered in by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX It appears XXXX XXXX  entered my personal information on to a falsified account. The XXXX was also able to identify there was a prior information on the account that was not mine. I tried to explain to the XXXX what had occurred and how now they had my personal information in my attempt to correct this information. The representative only indicate that she was not XXXXXXXX XXXX I was quite frustrated at this point. The XXXX representative did indicate I would need to submit a dispute form which would be mailed to me in 3 to 7 days. This document needed to be submitted with my signature and a nonfamily member counter signature or notarized. I then asked XXXX representative if this information would be filed against my credit. She indicated that debt was filed to my credit report this morning XX/XX/2024. At his point I became very angry and indicated XXXX had used my personal information base on my attempt to correct fraud on my personal information. The XXXX representative was not able to respond to my concerns. Now I have a bad credit filling on debt that is not mine. 

I contact my attorney and shard the above information with him. We both feel that now there has been further abuse of my personal information. XXXXXXXX XXXX should have never entered my personal information to the account that initially only had my name but did not have my SS # nor my address. Additionally, XXXX appears to be on fishing expeditions to make collection on debt in any manner to appease their needs. XXXX has initially information from XXXXXXXX XXXX was not mine and they did not attempt to clearly clarify information on the account. Instead, they somehow found my phone number and began harassing me until I contacted then as a concern citizen that there might be fraud occurring. Instead, they use my attempt to correct a wrongful complaint against me. I truly wonder how reputable XXXX is.

This account contains numerous discrepancies that not only misrepresent my financial history but also jeopardize my credit health and overall quality of life. 

The following inaccuracies have been identified in the report : 1. **Unverified Information** : The report indicates a "" Balance Owed '' of {$500.00}, with the "" Last Verified '' date marked as "" - ''. This lack of verification raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of this account. Under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), I am entitled to have accurate information reported, and it is clear that this account fails to meet that standard.

2. **Outdated Activity Dates** : The "" Date of Last Activity '' is listed as XX/XX/XXXX, yet the "" Date Reported '' is XX/XX/XXXX. This discrepancy implies that the information being reported is not current and reflects poorly on my credit history. Such inaccuracies can lead to unjust penalties on my credit score and may hinder my ability to secure loans or favorable interest rates.

3. **Misleading Account Status** : The report states that the "" Account Status '' is "" Open '' with a "" Payment Status '' of "" Late 120 Days. '' This misleading information suggests that I am not maintaining my financial obligations, which is simply untrue. Additionally, the "" Dispute Status '' indicates that this account is under investigation, yet every time I have reached out to XXXX regarding this matter, the account remains marked as "" being verified. '' This ongoing ambiguity creates a negative impact on my credit health and personal finances.

4. **Consumer Rights Violations** : The inaccuracies present in this report violate my rights under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), which requires consumer reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Additionally, 15 USC 1681i mandates that consumers have the right to dispute inaccuracies in their reports and to have them corrected in a timely manner.

The ongoing presence of this inaccurate and misleading information on my credit report has a profound impact on my life. It limits my access to credit, increases my financial burdens, and causes undue stress and anxiety regarding my financial future. I have made numerous attempts to resolve this issue with XXXX, yet their investigations have yielded no resolution, leaving me in a state of uncertainty and frustration. 

Given the severity of these issues, I respectfully request that LVNV Funding immediately conduct a thorough investigation into this account and take corrective action to ensure that my credit report accurately reflects my financial history. I expect the necessary updates to my account to be completed promptly, as my financial well-being depends on it. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your prompt response.

2024-09-07,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"I recently encountered a concerning issue with my auto loan servicing. On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX, with payments scheduled for the XXXX and XXXX of each month. Due to recent XXXX on my XXXX, I was XXXX  and unable to make my payment by the due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I informed XXXX via text message that I had just returned from the hospital and would be able to make the payment within the upcoming week and asked to let me rest. Instead of replying asking for a date, which would have been XX/XX/XXXX, he continued to allow the system to randomly run a process for the payment. 

Despite my clear communication, XXXX proceeded to process the payment on my account as soon as I unlocked my card for essential purchases such as XXXX  and a XXXX  diet. XXXX response to my situation was that he could not process payments for a later date and that he had tried calling me, to which I had mentioned my difficulty in speaking due to my XXXX and preferred to communicate via text. I asked why didnt he respond via text when he read the text. XXXX response was how was I supposed to know you couldnt speak. 

I am concerned about the lack of flexibility and understanding in this matter, especially given my health circumstances. Additionally, I believe that the company 's practices may not align with ethical customer service standards.

This denial is not only unfounded but also constitutes a clear violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2, which establish the permissible purposes for the inclusion of information in consumer reports and mandate the blocking of information resulting from identity theft.

Specifically : 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) prohibits the furnishing of consumer reports without a permissible purpose, and there is no permissible purpose for retaining fraudulent accounts on my report.

15 U.S. Code 1681c-2 explicitly requires credit reporting agencies to block information related to identity theft when proper documentation is provided, which I have already done. 
Your failure to comply with these provisions opens the way for civil liability for both negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n. Under this statute, a victim of noncompliance is entitled to {$1000.00} per violation. The continued reporting of accounts that were fraudulently opened without my express written consent constitutes multiple violations, as these accounts remain on my report without my authorization. 

This lack of action on XXXX part has resulted in further damage to my financial well-being, and I am prepared to pursue all legal remedies available to me under the FCRA if this issue is not resolved promptly. 

I am requesting the following immediate actions : Immediate blocking of the disputed items on my credit report, as they resulted from identity theft. 
A written explanation as to why my request was denied despite my submission of all required documentation. 
Compensation for the damages incurred as a result of Experians negligent and willful noncompliance with the FCRA. 
If this matter is not resolved within 10 business days, I will pursue formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and explore civil litigation to address these ongoing violations of my rights. 

Please take immediate steps to rectify this situation and ensure full compliance with the law.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,322XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10062678

As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning me in my consumer file. 
Despite previous disputes, the following accounts continue to reflect incorrect details. I urge you to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation to determine the accuracy of this information and delete the inaccurate items from my consumer file. 
Account Name/Account Number : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX / [ Account Number XXXX ] Inaccuracy : There are significant discrepancies in the reporting of the account information across different credit bureaus, particularly concerning payment history, balance details, and account status. 
Specifics : High Balance : XXXX reports a high balance of {$13000.00}, while Experian reports {$0.00}. This inconsistency suggests that the high balance information has not been accurately updated across bureaus. 
Last Verified Date : XXXX lists the last verified date as XX/XX/XXXX, but Experian does not report a verification date. This lack of consistency indicates that the account verification process may not have been applied uniformly. 
Date of Last Activity : Both XXXX and Experian report the date of last activity as XX/XX/XXXX ; however, the subsequent account activity reported by XXXX suggests ongoing discrepancies. The last activity date should be accurately verified. 
Date Reported : XXXX reports the date as XX/XX/XXXX, while Experian lists it as XX/XX/XXXX. The accurate date reported should be consistent across both bureaus. 
Balance Owed : Both XXXX and Experian show a balance owed of {$0.00}, but the payment history and account status suggest discrepancies in how this account was closed or charged off. This needs to be verified and corrected. 
Closed Date : XXXX reports a closed date of XX/XX/XXXX, but Experian does not provide a closed date. The closed date should be consistent and accurate across all reports. 
Account Status : Both bureaus report the account as "" Paid, '' but XXXX includes the remark "" Payment after charge off/collection '' and "" Canceled by credit grantor, '' while Experian states, "" Account has been closed due to inactivity '' and "" Unpaid balance reported as a loss by credit grantor. '' These differences in status and remarks should be reconciled and accurately reflected in all reports. 
Payment History : Experian reports delinquencies ( 30 days late in XXXX XXXX, 60 days late in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, etc. ), while XXXX shows no late payments reported. This discrepancy in payment history should be thoroughly investigated and corrected. 
Days Late - 7 Year History : XXXX reports no late payments, while Experian reports late payments in multiple months. This inconsistency must be addressed to ensure the accurate reporting of the payment history. 

Action Requested : Please conduct a comprehensive reinvestigation to ensure that all details, including the high balance, payment history, account status, and remarks, are accurately and consistently reported across all three credit bureaus. Any inaccuracies or inconsistencies should be corrected or deleted from my consumer file as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
You have 15 days from the receipt of this letter to conduct a reasonable investigation and rectify the inaccuracies as required by law. I expect all necessary changes to be made to my consumer file and for these changes to be forwarded to me at the address provided above. 
Please consider this my formal request for a reinvestigation and ensure that the inaccuracies are corrected promptly. I look forward to receiving confirmation of the changes made to my file.

Having previously discussed this with you, I'm writing to request that these accounts be promptly deleted from my report in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates that credit bureaus rectify erroneous information on consumer credit reports. These accounts have caused me stress because they are on my report. It's been difficult to deal with the impact because they don't represent my financial responsibility or credit history. I'm ready to take legal action to protect my rights and find a solution under the FCRA if we can't work this out. The inaccurate items that appear on my credit report have been a big obstacle for me. They're getting in the way of my important financial goals, like buying a house and taking care of my family.

Despite multiple requests, these fraudulent accounts remain, damaging my credit and personal reputation. 

On XX/XX/year>, while applying for the Alaska Permanent Dividend Fund ( PFD ), I encountered a serious glitch on their website. As I was submitting my application, the page refreshed and began displaying another individuals personal information. This included their address, date of birth, Social Security number, and bank account details. 

On that same day, I received two phone calls from individuals who had seen my personal information on the PFD website during the glitch. They confirmed that they had access to all of my private information. 

Soon after this data breach, fraudulent accounts began appearing in my name, clearly using the information that was leaked through the PFD website. I did not authorize the use of my personal information in any form, and my identity was stolen to create these fraudulent accounts. 

I demand that XXXX, XXXX, and Experian immediately remove these fraudulent accounts from my credit reports. This is my last warning, and I would prefer to resolve this matter peacefully, without the need for court intervention. However, if this issue is not resolved promptly, I will take legal action. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccurate information, and you are legally obligated to ensure that my credit report only reflects legitimate accounts. If you continue to refuse to act, I will pursue all available legal remedies, including litigation, to hold you accountable for the damage caused by this negligence.

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"While working with a mortgage underwriter to purchase a home, I discovered that my identity had been stolen. Several fraudulent accounts, including personal loans and credit cards, had been opened in my name without my knowledge. Before this, I wasnt educated about credit management and did little to understand my consumer score. This discovery was shocking and derailed my home-buying process, but it also forced me to confront gaps in my financial knowledge. Since then, Ive protected my credit and learned more about my financial health. This experience, while distressing, has made me more resilient and financially aware. Below is the list of the fraudulent accounts : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NC,28216,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,In progress,Yes,,10034430

Be advised that your claim is disputed and validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt is requested in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692 and as amended by adding the following new Title 8 USC 802 et seq., and the Fair Credit Billing Act, 15 USC. 1666 et seq. All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq. It is not now, nor has it ever been, my intention to avoid paying any obligation that is lawfully owed by the Claimant. I refuse to pay this alleged debt until the proper validation of this debt is provided. Please cease and desist all collection activities until you can properly validate this alleged debt.

15 USC1692c ( c ) Ceasing communication If a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that the consumer refuses to pay a debt or that the consumer wishes the debt collector to cease further communication with the consumer, the debt collector shall not communicate further with the consumer with respect to such debt.

If proper validation of this alleged debt is not provided within 30 calendar days of receiving this notice, I will assume this alleged debt to be invalid and you shall delete this account and stop all collection activities regarding this account. In order to make arrangements to pay an obligation which may be lawfully owed, please document and verify the debt by complying, in good faith, with this request for validation and return it to me, within thirty ( 30 ) days of receipt of this letter.

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of Claimant mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION and PROOF OF CLAIM made pursuant to the above-named Titles and Sections. I respectfully request that your offices provide Claimant with competent evidence as per the attached Declaration and Proof of Claim that I have any legal obligation to pay you the unsubstantiated alleged debt.

Provide under Rule 1002. Requirement of the Original An original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides otherwise.

Furthermore, you shall cease all verbal communication. No phone calls, no text messages, no social media contact, no ringless voicemail contact, no email contact, the only communication must be through the UNITED STATES POST OFFICE, to the Claimant.

At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the XXXX major Consumer reporting agencies, such as, XXXX, Experian and XXXX prior to validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt, this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact ; if any negative mark is found on any of Claimant consumer reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you and your client for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character Violation of United States Code TITLE 18 PART 1 CHAPTER 63 1341 ( Mail Fraud ) This debt is considered to be invalid until I receive proper validation and your offices provide Claimant with proof of claim of the disputed debt. Your offices have 30 days to produce the required documentation in accordance with FTC guidelines. During this validation period and proof of claim, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of Claimant consumer reports, said action will be considered a dishonor and cause the self-executing contract portion of this notice to be implemented. This includes any listing any information to a consumer reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated.

If your offices fail to respond to this validation and proof of claim request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from Claimant credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to Claimant immediately.

Title 8 USC 809. Validation of debts [ 15 USC 1692g ] ( b ) If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection ( a ) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or any copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector.

BLACKS LAW DICTIONARY : VERIFICATION. Confirmation of correctness, truth, or authenticity, by affidavit, oath, or deposition.

This account was deleted twice for inaccurate information. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ), if a previously deleted item is reinserted into a consumer 's credit report, I am entitled to be notified within five business days of the reinsertion. I have not received such notification, and I believe that this item has been reinserted improperly. 
This account has been reporting as a charge-off since XX/XX/XXXX. I have not received a 1099C from the company or the IRS stating that my account has been filed as a charge-off since XX/XX/XXXX. This account is also reporting a charge-off in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, showing a repossession in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This is very inaccurate and misleading information. 
This account is reporting the first delinquency occurred in XX/XX/XXXX and the last payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX Which both of these statements are inaccurate information.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ), furnishers of information are required to provide accurate information. Repeatedly reporting the same repossession and Charge off as new violates has lead to a distortion of my creditworthiness.

Additionally, according to 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), you, as a credit reporting agency, are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy in the information reported. The presence of these duplicate entries is a clear indication that this standard has not been met.

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. The dates listed for my account do not reflect the correct information, which results in an inaccurate portrayal of my payment history.

Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 1681c places specific limits on the length of time that negative information, such as delinquencies, may remain on a consumers credit report. Reporting an incorrect date of first delinquency could result in unfairly prolonging the negative impact on my credit.",,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30038,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,In progress,Yes,,10035329

I am aware that you have been sending out form letters in response to many of the disputes and challenges that consumers have submitted, regardless of the specific information that they have provided. This is ILLEGAL, as each dispute and challenge must be addressed INDIVIDUALLY and on its own merits. My letters were created by software thats created for everyone.

If you dont process my letters, you are VIOLATING 15 U.S. Code 5 1681. Keep in mind, you are not allowed to delay processing letters from consumers based on the assumption that help from a third party, may be available. This is NOT a legal exception. 

I am the AUTHOR of any letters you receive with my name on them. Either I or my advisors wrote them with my FULL KNOWLEDGE and CONSENT. I am aware that there is no law that says you need to provide a POWER OF ATTORNEY in order to delay processing letters from a consumer. IF YOU DO NOT PROCESS MY LETTERS IN A TIMELY MANNER, I WILL consider it to be an INTENTIONAL disregard for my rights.

During my XXXX  XXXX bankruptcy plan, when my loans were transferred from XXXX XXXX, Mohela failed to follow up or provide the necessary documentation to ensure a smooth transition. Furthermore, they have repeatedly failed to retain or furnish any records related to my loans prior to XXXX, including essential promissory notes and other loan documentation. This failure to maintain accurate records constitutes a severe breach of their responsibilities as a federal student loan servicer. 

Mohelas handling of my account has been unprofessional and negligent, placing an undue burden on me as the borrower. Their lack of transparency and failure to meet the standards of service expected of a federal loan servicer has caused significant frustration and financial complications.

Given these issues, I am requesting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate Mohelas actions and take necessary corrective measures to ensure that my loans are reassigned to a servicer that upholds the required standards of transparency, accountability, and professionalism.

I trust that the CFPB will address this matter swiftly and take appropriate action to protect borrowers like myself from further harm due to Mohelas mismanagement.

Experian, has stopped allowing me the ability to dispute this collection. Unless, I provide documentation for them to consider. 

There is no documentation to provide because this liability is not mine.

2024-09-07,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, Minnesota. XXXX XXXX  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 1700 G Street XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account : XXXX Complaint against Mohela Student Loan Server To : Whom It Concern Hello my name is XXXX XXXX and I am a recent XXXX  of XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX XXXX, Minnesota. I have presented you with this complaint because I am totally baffled with the current Loans that I have been presented with by the student loan server MOHELA, as well as the department of education 's website. Not long ago I looked on the department of education website and I saw that all of my consolidated loans had been paid in full, meaning they were forgiven by the XXXX administration. I then went back to the website 2 or 3 weeks later and I noticed that there had been more loans posted and the entire loan amount that had initially been forgiven was now reposted. 

I then noticed that the loan server that was accusing me of having loans was MOHELA, which has not been my loan server, ( My Loan server is XXXX ). This is what left me baffled, the question that i asked myself was why in the world didnt MOHELA claim to be my loan server when I was consolidating all of my loans? And why didnt MOHELA bring up these new loans when all the rest was under review for loan forgiveness? Why did MOHELA wait until my previous loans were forgiven to implement new loans? The only answer that I could come up with is that MOHELA wanted to bring back the old loans by implementing new loans, making it seem as if I never received loan forgiveness. I feel that this is a plot to keep me going in circles and in dept with loans.

Enclosed is documentation to show that i sent other complaints in the past and no one has contacted me.

Your case has been submitted!

Case Number : XXXX What's Next?

Thank you for submitting your feedback. It may take up to 15 days for someone to contact you. 





Complaint sent prior to this one XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Minnesota. XXXX XXXX XXXX Department of education complaint department XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX DC XXXX Suspected student loan fraud This complaint is in concern of a recent letter that I obtained from MOHELA federal student aid agency in XXXX, Missouri. XXXX, this letter is claiming that I have new loan consolidations and that I can start getting ready to pay these loans. the account number is # XXXX, this letter is showing two different loan amounts, one loan amount is XXXX, and the second loan amount is showing XXXX, both consolidation dates is XX/XX/XXXXXXXX 

The problem is that all of my loans have already been consolidated and this is shown by aid advantage, and all of my loans have also been forgiven, paid in full. This is also shown by the department of education, my total loan amount was only XXXX  and all of that has been consolidated. Those are the only loans that I had. 

My original loan server was XXXX, and then my loans were given to XXXX. And the amount never changed from server to server.

2024-09-07,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally submit a complaint regarding Navy Federal Credit Unions mishandling of a fraudulent loan account under my name. I have been a loyal member of Navy Federal for 17 years, during which time I have maintained several savings accounts, obtained car loans, and consistently supported the institution through a variety of financial products. Despite this long-standing relationship and strong track record, I recently became the victim of a sophisticated scam that has left me wrongfully liable for a {$5000.00} loan. 

On XX/XX/year>, I was contacted by scammers who masked their phone number to appear as though they were calling from Navy Federal Credit Union. Through this scam, they were able to access my account, apply for a personal loan of {$5000.00}, and transfer the funds via XXXX XXXX. Upon realizing I had been defrauded, I promptly notified Navy Federal and submitted all necessary documentation to demonstrate that this was a fraudulent act.

Despite my prompt reporting and Navy Federals stated "" zero liability '' policy, which is supposed to protect members in cases of unauthorized transactions and fraud, they have failed to apply this protection to my case. Instead, I have been held responsible for this fraudulent loan. Since the incident, I have been repeatedly redirected between their Fraud, Collections, and Security departments, each providing conflicting information and inundating me with endless paperwork to submit, resubmit, revise, and resign, with no resolution in sight. The constant back-and-forth has made it nearly impossible to achieve any meaningful progress in my case. Additionally, each time I called Navy Federal, I was kept on hold for hours and transferred through multiple agents, all of whom provided conflicting information, further exacerbating the situation and contributing to my sense of frustration and helplessness. 

Throughout the investigation, I made numerous attempts to put the loan payments on hold while the fraud was under review. Despite these efforts, I was ignored and told that they could not place the loan on hold because it had not been open for 30 days. Later, I was informed that Navy Federal does not typically offer payment holds during an investigation. This left me with no option but to continue making payments on a loan I did not authorize, forcing me to financially bear the burden of a fraudulent transaction even while it was being reviewed. This practice is not only unfair, but potentially illegal under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), which provides protection against liability for unauthorized transactions. Navy Federal 's refusal to place a hold on the loan payments while investigating the fraud violates the spirit of these legal protections and has caused me undue financial stress.

The only formal written communication I have received from Navy Federal on this matter was a one-line notice stating : We have reviewed your request and hold you liable for this loan. If you have any additional questions, please contact us in writing via messenger or follow Navy Federal 's established process for disputes. This response, given the gravity of the situation, is inadequate and lacks any meaningful explanation of their investigation or why their "" zero liability '' policy is not being applied.

At this point, I feel that Navy Federal, as a large institution, is overlooking their own commitment to protecting members from fraud. Despite my long-standing membership and solid financial history, my case has been handled without the proper consideration or transparency. The ongoing requests for additional paperwork, combined with the lack of clear communication, excessive hold times, and conflicting information from various agents, have left me feeling overwhelmed and abandoned by an institution I once trusted. 

Given my 17-year membership and responsible financial history, I believe I deserve fairer treatment and a thorough investigation under Navy Federals `` zero liability '' policy. I am requesting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus assistance in ensuring that Navy Federal absolves me of any liability for this fraudulent loan and improves their processes for handling fraud cases in a manner that is fair, transparent, and consistent with their stated policies, as well as with the EFTA. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Requested Action : I request that the CFPB investigate Equifaxs noncompliance with the FCRA and take appropriate action, including but not limited to : Immediate removal/blocking of the disputed adverse information in compliance with FCRA Section 605C.

Corrective action to ensure Equifax implements processes that meet the timeline of four business days for blocking information as required by law.

Any other penalties, fines, or disciplinary actions that are deemed necessary under FCRA for failure to adhere to legal obligations.

I appreciate the CFPBs assistance in addressing this violation and ensuring that Equifax complies with federal law, particularly for vulnerable consumers like victims of XXXX.

While the UCC itself doesn't specifically address the opening of bank accounts, it does provide some principles that can be relevant. 

1. **Good Faith and Fair Dealing** : Under the UCC, there is an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in all contracts. This means that banks must act honestly and fairly when dealing with customers. If a bank denies you an account without a valid reason, it could be argued that they are not adhering to this principle. 

2. **Discrimination Laws** : While the UCC focuses on commercial transactions, other laws, including federal and state anti-discrimination laws, may also apply. Banks can not deny services based on race, gender, religion, or other protected categories.

3. **Consumer Protection** : There are various consumer protection laws and regulations that banks must follow, which often require them to provide clear reasons for denying a service. If a bank fails to provide any reason for denial, it may be violating these regulations.

In summary, while the UCC may not directly state that it's illegal to deny an account without reason, principles of good faith, along with consumer protection laws, suggest that banks must provide legitimate reasons for their actions. If you feel you have been wrongfully denied an account, you may want to consider reaching out to a legal professional or a consumer protection agency for further guidance.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,DE,198XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10055776

These accounts were previously removed from my credit report after disputes but have been re-added without proper investigation or documentation. Additionally, there is evidence that certain accounts have been re-aged to make them appear more recent than they actually are.

The practice of re-aging and re-reporting discharged bankruptcy accounts contradicts both Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) standards and bankruptcy protection laws, and it has caused continued harm to my credit report. 

Specific Issues : XXXX. Failure to Verify Accounts Properly : XXXX allowed accounts to be re-added after being deleted, without requiring any further verification or investigation from the original creditors or debt buyers. There is no proof that these accounts have been properly validated in terms of transaction history to allow me to examine and verify, balances, dates, or my liability as I was on end of life care during the time period in question. 



XXXX. Re-Aging of Accounts : I have observed re-aging of multiple accounts, where the dates of last activity have been altered to reflect more recent dates, making these debts appear more current than they are. This tactic extends the reporting period for accounts that should no longer be listed or should be closer to expiring on my credit report under statute of limitations. 



XXXX. Reporting of Discharged Bankruptcy Accounts : XXXX has allowed the re-reporting of accounts that were included and discharged in my bankruptcy case. These accounts were wiped out in bankruptcy and should no longer be reported. XXXX has failed to verify that these accounts are no longer collectable and should not be appearing as adverse items. 



XXXX. Circumventing Legal Verification Requirements : The re-addition and re-aging of accounts appear to be a tactic used by debt collectors and creditors to bypass FCRA requirements, avoiding the proper steps of verification. XXXX has failed to hold these furnishers accountable, thus violating my consumer rights. 



XXXX. Negative Impact on My Credit and Health : The continued re-reporting and re-aging of these accounts, along with the wrongful inclusion of discharged debts, has significantly harmed my credit score and increased stress, negatively impacting my health.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NV,89107,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10034954

Both XXXX and XXXX reviewed my documentation, accepted it, and promptly removed the fraudulent accounts from my credit report. 

However, Equifax has refused to take similar action. After submitting my documentation, Equifax responded by stating that more documentation was required, without specifying exactly what was needed. When I contacted them for clarification, I was met with rude and insensitive customer service representatives who failed to provide clear guidance or transparency regarding the results of their investigation. 

This experience has been highly distressing, and I believe Equifax 's actions are inconsistent with their legal obligations under the XXXX and FCRA. I have already provided sufficient documentation, and Equifax is adding unnecessary hardship to an already traumatic situation. Furthermore, their failure to notify me of the results of the investigation is a violation of consumer rights. 

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intervene and compel Equifax to remove the fraudulent accounts from my credit report, as they are required to do under the law, without requiring further documentation. XXXX and XXXX have complied with the same documentation provided, and I ask that Equifax be held to the same standard.

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Procedures in case of disputed accuracy ), you are required to conduct a reasonable investigation when a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information on their credit report. I have not received proper written notice of the results of any investigation, which is a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( Notification of results of reinvestigation ).

Furthermore, I question how you can verify that these accounts truly belong to me if you are not conducting a thorough investigation. If you can not provide documented proof of these accounts validity, you are legally obligated to remove them from my credit report under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( Requirement to delete or modify information that can not be verified ). 

Additionally, I request that you remove any hard inquiries not associated with an open account, particularly those made within the last six months. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( Permissible purposes of consumer reports ), inquiries can only be made with my explicit consent, and I have not applied for new credit recently. With the recent nationwide data breach in which my Social Security number was exposed, its possible that credit was applied for in my name without my knowledge.

Lastly, please ensure the removal of any duplicate information from my credit report, as accuracy is required under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( Compliance procedures ).

I trust you will follow the law and promptly investigate and correct the errors in my credit report. Failure to comply may result in further action to protect my rights.

Be advised that your claim is disputed and validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt is requested in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692 and as amended by adding the following new Title 8 USC 802 et seq., and the Fair Credit Billing Act, 15 USC. 1666 et seq. All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq. It is not now, nor has it ever been, my intention to avoid paying any obligation that is lawfully owed by the Claimant. I refuse to pay this alleged debt until the proper validation of this debt is provided. Please cease and desist all collection activities until you can properly validate this alleged debt.

15 USC1692c ( c ) Ceasing communication If a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that the consumer refuses to pay a debt or that the consumer wishes the debt collector to cease further communication with the consumer, the debt collector shall not communicate further with the consumer with respect to such debt.

If proper validation of this alleged debt is not provided within XXXX  calendar days of receiving this notice, I will assume this alleged debt to be invalid and you shall delete this account and stop all collection activities regarding this account. In order to make arrangements to pay an obligation which may be lawfully owed, please document and verify the debt by complying, in good faith, with this request for validation and return it to me, within thirty ( XXXX  ) days of receipt of this letter.

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of Claimant mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION and PROOF OF CLAIM made pursuant to the above-named Titles and Sections. I respectfully request that your offices provide Claimant with competent evidence as per the attached Declaration and Proof of Claim that I have any legal obligation to pay you the unsubstantiated alleged debt.

Provide under Rule 1002. Requirement of the Original An original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides otherwise.

Furthermore, you shall cease all verbal communication. No phone calls, no text messages, no social media contact, no ringless voicemail contact, no email contact, the only communication must be through the UNITED STATES POST OFFICE, to the Claimant.

At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the XXXX  major Consumer reporting agencies, such as, Equifax, XXXX and XXXX prior to validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt, this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact ; if any negative mark is found on any of Claimant consumer reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you and your client for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character Violation of United States Code TITLE 18 PART 1 CHAPTER 63 1341 ( Mail Fraud ) This debt is considered to be invalid until I receive proper validation and your offices provide Claimant with proof of claim of the disputed debt. Your offices have XXXX  days to produce the required documentation in accordance with FTC guidelines. During this validation period and proof of claim, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of Claimant consumer reports, said action will be considered a dishonor and cause the self-executing contract portion of this notice to be implemented. This includes any listing any information to a consumer reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated.

If your offices fail to respond to this validation and proof of claim request within XXXX  days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from Claimant credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to Claimant immediately.

Title 8 USC 809.

I am writing to humbly request your consideration for a goodwill adjustment regarding my account and the late payments that occurred during XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. 
I understand the importance of maintaining a good payment history, and it is with a heavy XXXX that I find myself in this position. Unfortunately, during that time, I faced a series of deeply XXXX  personal events that severely impacted my ability to meet my financial obligations. 
In early XXXX, my mother, who had been battling a XXXX XXXX for several years, experienced a significant health crisis that required my immediate attention and care. The situation escalated quickly, leading to a hospitalization that kept her in critical condition for weeks. As her XXXX XXXX I found myself torn between managing her medical needs and maintaining my responsibilities at work. The overwhelming stress and emotional toll of watching my mother suffer was indescribable. 
To make matters worse, shortly after my XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was involved in a XXXX XXXX XXXX while rushing to the hospital to be by her side. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that made even the simplest daily tasks feel like XXXX  challenges. During this time, my focus was solely on family and recovery, and as a result, I fell behind on important financial commitments, including my payments to XXXX XXXX. 
I take my credit obligations seriously, and it pains me to have these late payments on my record. Thankfully, my mother has since shown signs of recovery, and I am in a better place both emotionally and physically. I am now ready to stabilize my finances and commit to paying off my account in full. 
Given these circumstances, I kindly ask for your understanding and support in removing the late payment marks for XXXX and XXXX. This goodwill adjustment would not only help restore my credit standing but also alleviate a significant burden as I work to rebuild my life after these trying months. I assure you of my continued commitment to timely payments moving forward. 
Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your understanding and compassion during this difficult time. I look forward to your positive response and hope to continue my relationship with Navy Federal Credit Union.

Despite my attempts to resolve these disputes through the proper channels, I was not provided with the appropriate validation of these debts, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Details of the Complaint : 1. Collection Agency : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Original Creditor : XXXX  Original Amount : {$290.00} Dispute Outcome : Verified as accurate, but no supporting validation or verification documents were provided. 
Despite my dispute, I was informed that this account "" belongs to me '' without any proof, such as a signed contract or a detailed statement outlining the debt. 
2. Collection Agency : XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Account Numbers : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
Original Amounts : {$40.00}, {$130.00}, {$39.00} ( balance amounts updated to {$49.00}, {$170.00}, and {$53.00}, respectively ) Dispute Outcome : Verified as accurate, with some fields updated, but no supporting validation documents were provided. These utility accounts were reported as being delinquent, but the collection agency failed to provide any original agreements, billing details, or verification showing that I owe these amounts. 
XXXX. Deletion of Items by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Account Numbers : XXXX and XXXX Dispute Outcome : These items were deleted after investigation, which implies that these debts were likely unverifiable. 
While this is a step in the right direction, it further demonstrates the overall lack of diligence in verifying the accuracy of items on my credit report. 
My Complaint : In each of these cases, I requested proper validation and verification of the debts in accordance with my rights under the FCRA and FDCPA. However, I was not provided with any documentation proving the validity of the debts, such as : Original contracts or signed agreements. 
Billing statements showing the origin of the debt and the amounts. 
Proof that these debts were legitimately assigned or sold to the collection agencies. 
Instead, the reporting agencies and collection agencies merely "" verified '' the debts without offering any tangible proof or explanation. This practice violates my rights as a consumer to verify the accuracy of debts that are negatively impacting my credit report. 

Action Requested : I request that the CFPB : Investigate the failure of Equifax, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide the required validation and verification documentation. 
Ensure that these disputed items are either validated with proper documentation or removed from my credit report. 
Provide any remedies available under the FCRA and FDCPA for non-compliance, including removing unverifiable accounts from my report. 
I have attached a copy of the dispute results from Equifax for your reference. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me if additional information or documentation is required. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",AZ,853XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10034429

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Dear XXXX XXXX  and CFPB, I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate, outdated, and misleading information associated with my credit report regarding the account listed by XXXX XXXX. This account contains numerous discrepancies that not only misrepresent my financial history but also jeopardize my credit health and overall quality of life. 

The following inaccuracies have been identified in the report : 1. **Unverified Information** : The report indicates a "" Balance Owed '' of {$500.00}, with the "" Last Verified '' date marked as "" - ''. This lack of verification raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of this account. Under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), I am entitled to have accurate information reported, and it is clear that this account fails to meet that standard.

2. **Outdated Activity Dates** : The "" Date of Last Activity '' is listed as XX/XX/XXXX, yet the "" Date Reported '' is XX/XX/XXXX. This discrepancy implies that the information being reported is not current and reflects poorly on my credit history. Such inaccuracies can lead to unjust penalties on my credit score and may hinder my ability to secure loans or favorable interest rates.

3. **Misleading Account Status** : The report states that the "" Account Status '' is "" Open '' with a "" Payment Status '' of "" Late 120 Days. '' This misleading information suggests that I am not maintaining my financial obligations, which is simply untrue. Additionally, the "" Dispute Status '' indicates that this account is under investigation, yet every time I have reached out to Equifax regarding this matter, the account remains marked as "" being verified. '' This ongoing ambiguity creates a negative impact on my credit health and personal finances.

4. **Consumer Rights Violations** : The inaccuracies present in this report violate my rights under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), which requires consumer reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Additionally, 15 USC 1681i mandates that consumers have the right to dispute inaccuracies in their reports and to have them corrected in a timely manner. 

The ongoing presence of this inaccurate and misleading information on my credit report has a profound impact on my life. It limits my access to credit, increases my financial burdens, and causes undue stress and anxiety regarding my financial future. I have made numerous attempts to resolve this issue with Equifax, yet their investigations have yielded no resolution, leaving me in a state of uncertainty and frustration. 

Given the severity of these issues, I respectfully request that XXXX XXXX immediately conduct a thorough investigation into this account and take corrective action to ensure that my credit report accurately reflects my financial history. I expect the necessary updates to my account to be completed promptly, as my financial well-being depends on it. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your prompt response.

Carrington paid the taxes to help but added items to what I owed them, especially in determining residency and appraisers, etc. Currently, I owe them some {$28000.00} outside of the {$300000.00}. Unbeknownst to me they went ahead with foreclosure and now a sheriff 's sale on XX/XX/XXXX. I had asked for a postponement XX/XX/XXXX because of medical issues. In the meantime I held out hope for financial assistance from the state. I figured if I could fix the mold and rodent problems, I would be able to get a fair market value for the sale of the house rather than foreclosure. XXXX is interested in another class action against Carrington and asked me to be a plaintiff. This involves padding charges, charging for services not necessarily done. I contacted Carrington for a total list of transactions on my account on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I am XXXX XXXX XXXXr on a fixed income. My home is where my business is. I have not been able to work full time as that area is where the mold is. 
Carrington has been very hard to contact or communicate with. I have used email, snail mail and fax. I called a number and person to call. I left a voicemail which was never answered. Their law firm served me in XXXX. They asked for info which I sent them to ask for a chance to get on my feet as I had surgeries scheduled. They never acknowledged it. The next item was to respond to them about disputing charges. I did but they did not acknowledge it. My next thing I know is the sheriff 's sale is on. I have known this since early last week. Today I received their letter about the sheriff 's sale. If Carrington and their law firm had written before or at least kept me in the loop, I believe I would have had time to try more avenues for relief. They strung me along and bam - the sheriff 's sale. I did not choose Carrington. The original lender was XXXX Mortgage who sold it to XXXX which went bankrupt and Carrington took over. Please caution older people about reverse mortgages. Rules and regulations were changed after I got the mortgage. I tried to refinance when I had more assets at least 4 times. Now my only assets are a XXXX XXXX XXXX cargo van and my artwork.",,"CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC",NJ,079XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10035341

I demand the late payment reported in MONTHS REPORTING LATE to be removed They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

This company never sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX Subject : Request for Reinvestigation and Removal of Inaccurate Information ( 3rd Time ) Reference : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ) Dear CFPB I am writing to formally request a reinvestigation of the following accounts listed in my consumer file, which I believe contain inaccurate information. As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning me in my consumer file. 
Despite previous disputes, the following accounts continue to reflect incorrect details. I urge you to conduct a thorough and reasonable reinvestigation to determine the accuracy of this information and delete the inaccurate items from my consumer file. 
Account Name/Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX / [ Account Number XXXX ] Inaccuracy : There are significant discrepancies in the reporting of the account information across different credit bureaus, particularly concerning payment history, balance details, and account status. 
Specifics : High Balance : TransUnion reports a high balance of {$13000.00}, while XXXX reports {$0.00}. This inconsistency suggests that the high balance information has not been accurately updated across bureaus. 
Last Verified Date : TransUnion lists the last verified date as XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX does not report a verification date. This lack of consistency indicates that the account verification process may not have been applied uniformly. 
Date of Last Activity : Both TransUnion and XXXX report the date of last activity as XX/XX/XXXX ; however, the subsequent account activity reported by TransUnion suggests ongoing discrepancies. The last activity date should be accurately verified. 
Date Reported : TransUnion reports the date as XX/XX/XXXX, while XXXX lists it as XX/XX/XXXX. The accurate date reported should be consistent across both bureaus. 
Balance Owed : Both TransUnion and XXXX show a balance owed of {$0.00}, but the payment history and account status suggest discrepancies in how this account was closed or charged off. This needs to be verified and corrected. 
Closed Date : TransUnion reports a closed date of XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX does not provide a closed date. The closed date should be consistent and accurate across all reports. 
Account Status : Both bureaus report the account as "" Paid, '' but TransUnion includes the remark "" Payment after charge off/collection '' and "" Canceled by credit grantor, '' while XXXX states, "" Account has been closed due to inactivity '' and "" Unpaid balance reported as a loss by credit grantor. '' These differences in status and remarks should be reconciled and accurately reflected in all reports. 
Payment History : XXXX reports delinquencies ( 30 days late in March 2024, 60 days late in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, etc. ), while TransUnion shows no late payments reported. This discrepancy in payment history should be thoroughly investigated and corrected. 
Days Late - 7 Year History : TransUnion reports no late payments, while XXXX reports late payments in multiple months. This inconsistency must be addressed to ensure the accurate reporting of the payment history. 

Action Requested : Please conduct a comprehensive reinvestigation to ensure that all details, including the high balance, payment history, account status, and remarks, are accurately and consistently reported across all three credit bureaus. Any inaccuracies or inconsistencies should be corrected or deleted from my consumer file as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
You have 15 days from the receipt of this letter to conduct a reasonable investigation and rectify the inaccuracies as required by law. I expect all necessary changes to be made to my consumer file and for these changes to be forwarded to me at the address provided above. 
Please consider this my formal request for a reinvestigation and ensure that the inaccuracies are corrected promptly. I look forward to receiving confirmation of the changes made to my file. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX never sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided.

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"I am filing a formal complaint against TransUnion LLC for their improper handling of my request to block fraudulent inquiries and their failure to provide adequate assistance in resolving this matter. My name is XXXX XXXX, and my file number is XXXX. 

**Background : ** On XX/XX/2024, I received an unsatisfactory and unsupported response from TransUnion concerning my request to block fraudulent inquiries. TransUnion incorrectly declined to block inquiries made by XXXX ( XX/XX/2024 ) and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XX/XX/2024 ), claiming that the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report I submitted was not a valid document. This decision is inconsistent with the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and California state laws. 

**Specific Issues : ** 1. **Refusal to Block Fraudulent Inquiries : ** Despite providing a valid FTC Identity Theft Report ( Report Number : XXXX ), which complies with both federal and state laws, TransUnion refused to block the fraudulent inquiries. This refusal violates FCRA Section 605B and California Civil Code 1798.92.

2. **Inadequate Phone Assistance : ** I have attempted to follow up on this issue via phone. During these calls, representatives disconnected the line, refused assistance, and provided misleading information about protocols and procedures. This pattern of behavior has included : - Representatives disconnecting calls without resolution. 
- Misleading statements regarding dispute processes. 
- Refusal to acknowledge or act upon the valid documentation I provided. 

**Violation of Federal and State Laws : ** - **Federal Law ( FCRA, Section 605B ) : ** Under FCRA, TransUnion is obligated to block fraudulent information when provided with a valid FTC Identity Theft Report. Their refusal to comply violates this requirement.

- **California State Law : ** The California Identity Theft Act mandates that credit reporting agencies must promptly investigate and block fraudulent accounts upon receiving proper documentation. TransUnion 's failure to act on the FTC Identity Theft Report contravenes this law as well. 

**Details of the Fraudulent Inquiries : ** - **XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ** These inquiries were unauthorized and result from identity theft. The continued presence of these inquiries on my credit report is harming my credit standing and financial opportunities. 

**Actions Requested : ** I request the CFPB to intervene and compel TransUnion to : 1. Immediately block the fraudulent inquiries from XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
2. Comply with FCRA Section 605B and California Civil Code 1798.92.

3. Provide a detailed explanation of their investigation methods, including all communications with XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and any other relevant parties. 
4. Provide me with an updated credit report reflecting the removal of the fraudulent inquiries.

5. Ensure that TransUnion ceases further violations of my consumer rights under federal and state laws. 

**Supporting Documentation : ** - FTC Identity Theft Report ( Report Number : XXXX ) - TransUnion Response ( Dated : XX/XX/2024 ) - Records of phone calls with TransUnion representatives TransUnions refusal to address my legitimate concerns and their improper handling of my disputes is a clear violation of consumer protection laws.

Reliance/XXXX are in direct violation of the FCRA and CFPB regulations as they are knowingly reporting inaccurate and inconsistent information about my payment History.

As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ), the credit bureaus are legally required to conduct a reasonable investigation and respond to disputes within 30 days.

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"On XX/XX/2024, I received an improper and unsupported response from TransUnion regarding my fraud block request ( File Number : XXXX ). TransUnion incorrectly declined to block fraudulent inquiries by XXXX ( XX/XX/2024 ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/2024 ), falsely claiming that the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report I submitted was not an official, valid document. This decision violates both the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and California state laws designed to protect consumers from identity theft and fraudulent activity. 

# # # **Violation of Federal Law ( FCRA, Section 605B ) : ** Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2 ), TransUnion is required to block fraudulent information on a credit report when a valid Identity Theft Report is provided by the consumer. The FTC Identity Theft Report I submitted ( Report Number XXXX XXXX  ) was generated through the FTCs authorized online platform, www.identitytheft.gov, and fully complies with federal law. This document included my personal identifying information, the specific fraudulent accounts in question, and a certification that I was a victim of identity theft. There is no legal requirement to provide a separate law enforcement report when the FTC Identity Theft Report is provided.

Despite fulfilling all the requirements outlined by the FCRA, TransUnion refused to block the fraudulent inquiries. Their failure to comply with this legal obligation violates federal law and constitutes a violation of my consumer rights.

# # # **Violation of California State Laws : ** As a California resident, I am also protected by the California Identity Theft Act ( California Civil Code 1798.92 et seq. ), which provides additional protections for victims of identity theft. Under California law, credit reporting agencies are required to investigate and block fraudulent accounts promptly upon receiving proper documentation. The FTC Identity Theft Report qualifies as an official document under both federal and state law, yet TransUnion has refused to take the required action, further infringing upon my rights.

# # # **Details of the Fraudulent Inquiries : ** - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2024 ) ** Both inquiries were made without my authorization and are the result of identity theft. I have provided all necessary documentation, yet TransUnions refusal to block these inquiries from my credit report continues to cause harm to my credit standing and financial opportunities. 

# # # **Actions Requested : ** I request the CFPBs assistance in compelling TransUnion to : 1. Immediately block the fraudulent inquiries from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
2. Comply with the FCRA, Section 605B, and XXXX Civil Code 1798.92.

3. Provide a detailed explanation of their investigation method, including copies of all communications between TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and any other relevant parties. 
4. Provide me with an updated credit report reflecting the removal of the fraudulent inquiries.

5. Prevent further violations of my consumer rights under both federal and state law.

I have had exceptional payment history with this company and all payments were placed on Autopay.

This was clearly a billing error made my the company and is not a reflection of my payment experience which violates USC Code 1681eb. This error has caused severe hard to my reputation, my character, my mode of living and to my family!

I demand the late payment reported in MONTHS REPORTING LATE to be removed They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 

This company never sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided.

I am a small business owner in my community, and my husband is a XXXX  who both work very hard with two XXXX  children. 

We have been Kia customers since XXXX and have leased 6 Kias. To say that we have been abused emotionally, financially and mentally, exploited, manipulated, robbed and bullied is a complete understatement. 

I leased my sixth Kia back in XX/XX/XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX and in an Unfortunate event my car was flooded but not a total loss on XX/XX/XXXX. I decided to have the vehicle towed back to the Kia dealership ( on XXXX XXXX ) so they can try to fix the issues. XXXX paid the dealership for my vehicle to be stored on their property while all of the issues were being attended to. Within the three months of leaving my vehicle with the Kia dealership, not only Was my vehicle left out on the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Streets and in that time frame incurred 4 tickets That Kia hid from me each time I went to check on the car and the status. After the fourth time my car, then was booted the day before XXXX was going to pick it up and it was only then that the manager XXXX called me so then let me know my car is no longer in their possession but now with the XXXX XXXX XXXX financial division. I was lied to. I was treated inappropriately once I claimed that the dealership had to pay for the tickets. XXXX was the head manager who berated me yelled at me and told me that they were legally allowed to leave the cars out on the street although XXXX has been paying for a storage fee to make sure that my car was placed on their property. They wanted nothing to do with the situation, No one will pick up the calls for me. No one wanted to speak with me and it wasnt until I went down to the financial district that I even find out that they were four tickets That were thrown away by one of the employees. It gets worse- Through these actions, my situation with my car, completely spiraled out of control to the point in which I had to Miss many days of work, fighting the case for many hours and degrading conversation with the staff, Emotionally drained, I then had to continue to pay out of pocket for a replacement vehicle. Pay out of pocket for my car lease and out of pocket for my insurance. And to add insult to injury, my car was never recovered from this situation. 

This entire mess could have been prevented and avoided had Kia the dealership left my vehicle on their property. Never again will I be utilizing this company and allow for this type of abuse.

As you are aware, the breach exposed sensitive personal information, including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and in some cases, driver 's license numbers.

According to Section 611 of the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), credit reporting agencies are required to investigate disputes, and if any information is found to be inaccurate or unverifiable, it must be promptly corrected or removed from the credit report. 

Specifically, I am disputing the following items on my credit report : XXXX XXXX - Account number : XXXX XXXX XXXX  - Account Number : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX - Account Number : XXXX XXXX - Account Number : XXXX XXXX - Account Number : XXXX I am requesting that these items be investigated and corrected or removed from my credit report. I believe they are the result of fraudulent activity and should not reflect negatively on my credit history. 

Please investigate this matter and provide a response within the 30-day period required under the FCRA. I also request that Equifax send me a copy of the corrected report once the investigation is complete, and that any corrections be communicated to other credit reporting agencies. 

In the meantime, I ask that a note be added to my file stating that this information is disputed and under investigation in compliance with Section 611 of the FCRA.

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

This company never sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided.

The account in question does not belong to me and is negatively affecting my credit score.

The details of the disputed account are as follows : I have never opened nor authorized this account. According to 281 SW715.719, I presume there is no evidence to support the alleged debt. Therefore, it can be concluded that no such debt actually exists.

Under the FCRA, you are required to : 1. Investigate my dispute within 30 days of receipt. 
2. Notify the creditor of my dispute.

3. Provide me with the results of your investigation in writing.

4. Delete or correct the inaccurate information if your investigation supports my claim.

Enclosed, please find copies of the following documents to support my dispute : 1. A copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed account.

2. A copy of my driver 's license for identification.

3. A notarized affidavit of identity theft.

4. Any additional documents ( e.g., police report, FTC Identity Theft Report ) that support my claim. 

If this error is not corrected promptly, I will have no choice but to seek legal action to protect my rights. I trust that Equifax will address this matter swiftly to avoid litigation. 

Please confirm receipt of this dispute letter and initiate your investigation immediately. I expect a timely resolution as stipulated by the FCRA.

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Procedures in case of disputed accuracy ), you are required to conduct a reasonable investigation when a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information on their credit report. I have not received proper written notice of the results of any investigation, which is a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( Notification of results of reinvestigation ).

Furthermore, I question how you can verify that these accounts truly belong to me if you are not conducting a thorough investigation. If you can not provide documented proof of these accounts validity, you are legally obligated to remove them from my credit report under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( Requirement to delete or modify information that can not be verified ).

Additionally, I request that you remove any hard inquiries not associated with an open account, particularly those made within the last six months. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( Permissible purposes of consumer reports ), inquiries can only be made with my explicit consent, and I have not applied for new credit recently. With the recent nationwide data breach in which my Social Security number was exposed, its possible that credit was applied for in my name without my knowledge.

Lastly, please ensure the removal of any duplicate information from my credit report, as accuracy is required under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( Compliance procedures ).

I trust you will follow the law and promptly investigate and correct the errors in my credit report. Failure to comply may result in further action to protect my rights.

Following that, on XX/XX/XXXX, which was within the 30-day timeframe, I called Barclays again to ask for a replacement card since my original card was damaged and also about redeeming my XXXX miles in rewards. The agent informed me that I could redeem them for cash back and that a check would be mailed to me ( see attached file XXXX ). However, despite more than two months having passed since that conversation, I have not yet received the check. 

I have reached out multiple times via online message but have not received any valid or actionable response from Barclays. I called your customer service team again tonight, but unfortunately, there was still no response or resolution to my issue.

I have called Citizens and spoke with a representative whom told me that according to "" their records, '' at the time I only had 13 % equity according to the appraisal of {$170000.00}, which is how much I paid for the home.

No specialist ever reached out.

I have previously disputed these charges, and I am dismayed to find that they have not been resolved in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 

The charges in question are the result of fraud, and I should not be held liable for any fees or interest related to this fraudulent activity. I request that you immediately remove all late fees and interest charges associated with the fraudulent transactions and adjust my account accordingly.

This request is in accordance with the following laws and regulations : 1. The Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), 15 U.S.C. 1666 : This law stipulates that creditors must promptly credit or refund overpayments and correct billing errors, including unauthorized charges. The FCBA limits a cardholder 's liability for unauthorized use of their credit card to {$50.00}. 
2. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), 15 U.S.C. 1693 : While primarily applicable to debit cards, this act also provides protections against fraudulent transactions and limits consumer liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers.

3. The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. : This act requires creditors to provide clear and accurate disclosures about the terms and costs of consumer credit, including how interest is calculated and when it is applied.

4. Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226 : This regulation implements TILA and provides specific rules for credit card issuers, including how to handle billing errors and unauthorized use claims.

5. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. : This act requires that credit reporting agencies and furnishers of information ( such as credit card companies ) ensure the accuracy of information in consumer credit reports.

Furthermore, I remind you of your obligations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ) in consumer financial products and services.

I request that you conduct a thorough investigation of this matter and provide a written explanation of your findings within 30 days, as required by the FCBA. If you find that the charges were indeed fraudulent, I expect all related fees and interest charges to be removed from my account immediately.

If you fail to comply with this request, I will not hesitate to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seek legal counsel to enforce my rights under the aforementioned laws.

2024-09-07,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"I was denied credit by WELLS FARGO when they closed my existing line of credit. 
According to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act adverse action against a consumer is against the law which is codified in 15 USC 1691c and is pursuant to civil liability under 15 USC 1692k. WELLS FARGO subject to criminal liability for violating 15 USC as I have proof that I was discriminated against due to the correspondence I received.

WELLS FARGO is in violation of 15 USC 1642, 15 USC 1681m and 12 CFR 1002 because I, the consumer, opened an account in good faith, but credit was WRONGFULLY terminated. 
I also noticed WELLS FARGO was furnishing information to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX that violate my Fair Credit Reporting Act rights as a consumer. The reporting of this account has caused severe damage to my character, my reputation, my general ability of living as well as my ability to obtain credit obligations for personal purposes. Ultimately this negligence has damaged my livelihood and my ability of using credit in my life. This account is not compliant and is violating multiple FCRA laws. 
15 USC 1681b- Permissible Purpose of Consumer reports- ( a ) IN GENERAL Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. 15 USC 1681e ( b ) Compliance and procedures ( b ) ACCURACY OF REPORT Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 15 USC 1681 section 602 ( a ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. XXXX, XXXX and XXXX are consumer reporting agencies, and I am the Consumer. Which means that I have the right to make sure my private information isn't shared and is backed by 15 USC 1681. 15 USC 1681 Congressional Findings and Statement of Purpose ( a ) ACCURACY AND FAIRNESS OF CREDIT REPORTING The Congress makes the following findings : ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. ( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers. ( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers. ( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. Incorrect reporting to my consumer file is damaging my ability to be approved for credit and is a misrepresentation of my character. This is a violation of my rights, negligent behavior. 12 CFR 1016.7 states that A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time. '' Per the FCRA, as a federally protected consumer, I am hereby formally opting out of any and all authorization, I the consumer, may have given WELLS FARGO, whether it be written, unwritten, verbal and non verbal per 15 USC 6802. Effective immediately and indefinitely. 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) states that "" A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. '' WELLS FARGO never informed me of my right to exercise my nondisclosure option. Not only that 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) states "" Except as authorized under subsection ( b ), no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information : Any other adverse item of information, other than records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than seven years. '' This account is an adverse item they are reporting WITHOUT my permission which is against the law. 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) states "" A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

15 U.S. Code 1681e states "" Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of section 1681c of this title and to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b of this title. XXXX, XXXX and XXXX are NOT maintaining reasonable procedures. These accounts are also violations of IRS Publication 4681. Which mentions I should have received a 1099c form from WELLS FARGO due to the debt being discharged, canceled or forgiven. My consumer report should not reflect a balance owed, a past due amount, nor should there be any late payments associated with this charge off account. Incorrect reporting to my consumer file is damaging my ability to be approved for credit and is a misrepresentation of my character. This is a violation of my rights, negligent behavior and potentially an act of tax fraud, to which I am not party of, nor do I wish to be.

However, before I received the debt validation I actually did reach out to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX and explained the situation. Apparently, XXXX has agreed that I never received the original invoice and as a result has agreed to remove me out of collections. They failed to send it out. That's fair enough. I can forgive them as they were honest about it. The invoice is {$160.00}. I have agreed to work out a payment arrangement with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I'll have to wait until next Thursday because my debt is still with Revco Solutions. The hope is by next Thursday I'll be free from REVCO Solutions collection agency. I'm sure you can appreciate that these matters can cause extreme stress. I have a lot of my plate right now and it looks like in the future I will no longer be seeking anymore medical care because if this is any indication of what can happen, I would rather go without any specialist care. From now on I will only seek out the services of my Direct Primary Care physician. My primary care doctor I pay a monthly retainer membership so there is no surprise billing. This will of course limit the amount of care I receive, but to be honest and I mean this from the bottom of my heart -- I would rather die from some future illness or disease than to deal with medical collections. So therefore I will be canceling my future XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I can't rely on insurance based care. I'll still have medical insurance but I just won ; t use it anymore. 
On the Primary level I'll just have to focus on healthy eating, exercise, and the services from my Direct Primay Care Practice.

XXXX claimed he had a cat, so this wouldnt be a problem, but he was out of town, and his cousin would pick up the couch up the following day if it was still available, offering to pay immediately via XXXX or XXXX. 
Yes, I fell for it. I never make online transfers, which may be what saved me from more loss, because my bank & lack of prior electronic transfers that arent from verified XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ) freaked my bank out, especially on a long holiday weekend. 

I didnt receive any notifications of financial transfer attempts. XXXX claimed there was an issue, and sent a screenshot, which gave me faith that this was real. It was my 1st & last time at that rodeo. 

I then received an email alleging to be from XXXX, claiming that the money had been sent from XXXX, but was being held because I rarely transfer money online via non-fdic-associated & the activity looked suspicious. 

Usually I check headers of every single email, especially after the recent XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  leaks, but because of the corroboration from XXXX & many other stressful factors, including why I was selling the couch in the first place, ( I want to stay housed ) made me react rather than think critically, even though I know in selling something, one should not have to pay their buyer. 

This is how I didnt notice that the email originated from XXXX and not XXXX or any subdomain, XXXX XXXX XXXX  or anything ending in XXXX - I had a XXXX XXXX  at age XXXX and the internet was different. 

I am autistic and when I am right, I will still be wrong. My suspicion is taken for paranoia and my kindness is seen as weakness. My intuition told me to not do any of it.

Not one email address was duplicated - every attempt to a new email address. My bank locked me out again. What these people didnt know is that I live below the poverty line, receive food stamps, so I am the worst person to target for this. My brain began melting. I wanted to hang up and say eff this guy but I wanted to believe XXXX too. 

Then the Fake XXXX guy broke character and asked for the code my bank texted me, and I was done because I know that is not for anyone but me and an agent at my bank. I called my bank ( via the number on the back of my debit card ) & spoke to XXXX directly via my XXXX  need support or a callback? settings.

According to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act adverse action against a consumer is against the law which is codified in 15 USC 1691c and is pursuant to civil liability under 15 USC 1692k. AMERICAN EXPRESS subject to criminal liability for violating 15 USC as I have proof that I was discriminated against due to the correspondence I received.

.AMERICAN EXPRESS is in violation of 15 USC 1642, 15 USC 1681m and 12 CFR 1002 because I, the consumer, opened an account in good faith, but credit was WRONGFULLY terminated. 
I also noticed AMERICAN EXPRESS was furnishing information to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX that violate my Fair Credit Reporting Act rights as a consumer. The reporting of this account has caused severe damage to my character, my reputation, my general ability of living as well as my ability to obtain credit obligations for personal purposes. Ultimately this negligence has damaged my livelihood and my ability of using credit in my life. This account is not compliant and is violating multiple FCRA laws. 
XXXX5 USC 1681b- Permissible Purpose of Consumer reports- ( a ) IN GENERAL Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. 15 USC 1681e ( b ) Compliance and procedures ( b ) ACCURACY OF REPORT Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 15 USC 1681 section 602 ( a ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. XXXX and XXXX are consumer reporting agencies, and I am the Consumer. Which means that I have the right to make sure my private information isn't shared and is backed by 15 USC 1681. 15 USC 1681 Congressional Findings and Statement of Purpose ( a ) ACCURACY AND FAIRNESS OF CREDIT REPORTING The Congress makes the following findings : ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. ( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers. ( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers. ( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. Incorrect reporting to my consumer file is damaging my ability to be approved for credit and is a misrepresentation of my character. This is a violation of my rights, negligent behavior. 12 CFR 1016.7 states that A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time. '' Per the FCRA, as a federally protected consumer, I am hereby formally opting out of any and all authorization, I the consumer, may have given AMERICAN EXPRESS, whether it be written, unwritten, verbal and non verbal per 15 USC 6802. Effective immediately and indefinitely. 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) states that "" A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. '' AMERICAN EXPRESS never informed me of my right to exercise my nondisclosure option. Not only that XXXX USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) states "" Except as authorized under subsection ( b ), no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information Any other adverse item of information, other than records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than seven years. '' This account is an adverse item they are reporting WITHOUT my permission which is against the law. 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) states "" A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 15 U.S. Code 1681e states "" Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of section 1681c of this title and to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b of this title. XXXX, XXXX and XXXX are NOT maintaining reasonable procedures.

However, I have encountered two significant issues : Premature Withdrawal : The first payment was withdrawn from my linked XXXX account a day earlier than expected. This unexpected withdrawal caused my account to overdraft, resulting in severe financial inconvenience. 

Incorrect Amount Withdrawn : The amount withdrawn was not as anticipated. Instead of the first installment of the {$3200.00} purchase, the entire balance, including the {$3200.00} charge, was withdrawn. This is contrary to the purpose of using Flex Pay to spread out the payment over five months. 

I understand that my XXXX settings are set for "" Full Balance. '' However, I assumed that by using Flex Pay for a specific purchase, the system would automatically adjust the payment amount accordingly. 

Additionally, I was charged the Flex Pay fee, which is typically associated with splitting payments. Since the entire balance was withdrawn in the first payment, it is unclear why this fee was applied.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",DE,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,10055948

On XX/XX/year>, we entered into a contract to purchase a home owned by a veteran. This property was advertised with a VA assumable mortgage at an attractive interest rate, a key selling point for us. Just three days later, the veteran submitted an application to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for us to assume this loan. Initially, we were informed that all communication would be conducted exclusively through mail, with no option for phone or email contact. 
After weeks of waiting without any communication, the seller managed to obtain an email address. We promptly sent an email and received the application documents, which we returned on the same day. Additionally, we overnighted a paper copy to the service provider, Dovenmuehle. Despite responding to all requests within 24 hours, communication from Dovenmuehle has been consistently slow. The process finally entered underwriting on XX/XX/XXXX. We were required to send a check for {$4100.00}, which was cashed on XX/XX/year>. 
It has now been over 120 days since we initiated this process, with more than 74 days spent in underwriting. The initial documentation indicated that the entire process could take up to 90 days, including up to 45 days in underwriting. 
Communication with Dovenmuehle has been extremely difficult. Although the seller submitted official documentation authorizing both us and his realtor to inquire about the loan assumption, customer service representatives eventually stopped recognizing this authorization and imposed additional requirements to receive updates. 
Meanwhile, we are unable to close on the purchase of this home. Due to a job-related move to a new state, this situation is incredibly frustrating, costly ( exceeding $ XXXX in rental fees ), and challenging for both us and the seller.

My husband ( XXXX XXXX and I ( XXXX ) were First Republic checking account customers - After Chase acquired First Republic, we became Chase customers and our three checking accounts ( XXXX individual for XXXX and XXXX, and one joint ) got moved to Chase and with the full integration that happened in XXXX timeframe, the three accounts got assigned different Chase tiers- this created confusion and we set up time with XXXX XXXX XXXX from Chase 's XXXX MA branch to discuss the matter. 

XXXX. We met with XXXX XXXX XXXX in-person on XX/XX/year> to discuss the tier of service at Chase ( vs. what we had previously with XXXX XXXX. We talked about the difference between "" Sapphire '' and "" Private Client '' levels specifically, and in particular we were told that : "" For Sapphire level we need to qualify individually ( $ XXXX per person ), but Private Client level allows us to be treated as a household and we can meet the $ XXXX minimum requirements together. '' Further, Private Client level allows for fees on self-directed accounts to be waived and we can include those balances also towards the $ XXXX minimum requirement. 

SEE ATTACHMENT 1 3. We relied on the above information provided and moved new funds into Chase to meet "" Private Client '' level of service and opened three new brokerage ( XXXX, XXXX, Joint ) and three new investment accounts ( XXXX, XXXX, Joint ) ; We currently have NINE accounts total, including the three original checking accounts that ported over from XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, Joint ), and we exceed the $ XXXX minimum when considering all XXXX Chase accounts. 

XXXX. On XX/XX/year> - we received an email saying that our account balances do not meet the minimum requirements for "" Private Client '' level, with a warning that fees will be levied. Upon speaking with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year>- he apologized for mis-stating the account minimum requirements at our original meeting ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) and offered to downgrade our account to a lower level to avoid these monthly fees. 

XXXX. However, moving to a lower tier of service will impose other fees on the brokerage and self-directed accounts we have opened since the conversation on XX/XX/year> - we only opened these accounts because of the "" Private Client '' benefits/fee waivers. Further, these investment accounts have {$75.00} closing fees per account ( {$450.00} total ) - so we asked if these fees could be waived and we could then downgrade to a lower tier of checking accounts. After 4-5 weeks of conversations, we're now being told that Chase will not waive these "" closing '' fees on investment accounts even though we were persuaded to open these accounts as part of the "" Private Client '' service, tied to our checking accounts. 

XXXX. Further, Chase XXXX branch manager ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) had promised to resolve these issues and told us we will not be charged any fees until this matter is sorted out. Notwithstanding her promises, we were charged a total of {$70.00} ( two {$35.00} charges on both XXXX and XXXX 's checking accounts ) on XX/XX/year> and expect this will continues every month until this matter is resolved. XXXX XXXX has been unresponsive to both emails and phone calls over the last two weeks as the situation has worsened.

However, no appraisal or credit report had been completed, and no other substantive services were provided at the time I withdrew from the process. 

Given this lack of clarity and service, I am requesting a full refund of my deposit. Please provide a detailed explanation, in writing, for why the deposit was withheld and on what grounds Rocket Mortgage believes it is entitled to retain these funds.

I have provided all the necessary information required by Early Warning to apply for the report, including but not limited to social security number, name, address, date of birth, and phone number. I also followed their instructions and submitted the application through the specified methods. 

However, a week has passed and I have not received any notice about the progress of the report, nor have I received the report itself. I have tried to contact Early Warning 's customer service department multiple times, but each time I either encountered a long waiting time or was unable to get through. 

This situation has caused me great distress and inconvenience because I need this report to understand the relevant information and make important decisions. 

I believe that Early Warning 's failure to provide the report in a timely manner is an irresponsible behavior that has seriously affected my rights and interests. I hope that your bureau can intervene in the investigation of this matter, prompt Early Warning to provide the report I applied for as soon as possible, and improve their services to avoid similar situations from happening again.

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"Subject : FORMAL DISPUTE AND DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF INACCURATE INFORMATION AND DEBT VALIDATION Account : APPLE CARD - GS BANK Account Numbers : XXXX Notice to Agent is Notice to Principle and Notice to Principle is Notice to Agent, I am writing to demand the immediate removal of inaccurate and conflicting information on my credit file for the accounts listed above. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are legally required to report only accurate and verifiable information. Failure to comply with FCRA Section 611 mandates the removal or correction of inaccurate information within 30 days. 

Due to the recent XXXX XX/XX/XXXX data breach, which exposed sensitive consumer data, it is imperative that my information be handled with utmost care to mitigate risks of identity theft and fraud. 

Discrepancies in Reporting : The APPLE CARD - GS BANK account, under account number XXXX, exhibits significant inconsistencies : 1. Conflicting Status Update Dates : One report lists a charge-off status update in XX/XX/XXXX, while another lists it in XX/XX/XXXX. 
2. Payment History Mismatch : Inconsistencies in the payment history for charge-offs and delinquency periods between the two accounts.

3. Missing Original Creditor Information : Goldman Sachs is listed as the original creditor in one report but omitted in another.

4. Unverified Highest Balance Information : One report states the highest balance as {$1900.00}, while the other omits this information. 

This conflicting information is unverifiable and does not accurately reflect my credit activity. Under FCRA Section 611, I demand the immediate removal of this account from my credit report.

Demand for Debt Validation : Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I request full validation of this debt. You are required to provide : 1. Proof the debt belongs to me.

2. A full accounting of the balance, including how {$1800.00} was calculated.

3. Copies of the original signed agreement indicating my legal obligation to pay this debt.

4. Name and contact information of the original creditor, along with all related documentation. 

If this debt can not be fully validated within 30 days, you must remove it from my credit report and cease all reporting. Non-compliance will be considered a willful violation of FCRA Section 611 and FDCPA, prompting me to pursue all available legal remedies, including filing complaints with the CFPB and considering a lawsuit under federal law.

Expectations for Resolution : An immediate investigation into this account is mandatory. Provide verifiable proof that this debt is mine and accurate, or remove this item from my credit report.

Failure to resolve this matter within 30 days will result in : 1. Filing formal complaints with the CFPB and FTC.

2. Considering legal action for damages due to willful non-compliance under the FCRA, entitling me to statutory damages and compensation for harm caused by incorrect reporting. 

Given the data breach, the urgency of this matter can not be overstated. Notify me in writing of the investigation results and provide an updated copy of my credit report once changes are made. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious matter.

This company did not honor my consumer rights as a citizen in America regarding my consumer credit file, this company ignored not 1, but 7 documented and certified complaints and letters regarding my identity being compromised. Under stated consumer rights law this company didnt protect, honor, or respect my claim and rights. I provided evidence, police reports, FTC reports, and supporting valid identity documents to verify myself throughout this 6-month process. This company did not honor my rights or acknowledge my supporting documents regarding identity theft. I was incarcerated for 10 years with proof when all these accounts were open illegally and fraudulently and Ive proven this matter and will prove it in court without a doubt.

I request your intervention to ensure compliance with the appropriate regulations governing accurate and fair credit reporting.

Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), creditors and financial institutions are legally required to report accurate and timely information to credit reporting agencies. According to the law : Accuracy of Information ( 1681s-2 ( a ) ) : Furnishers of credit information are required to report accurate information to credit reporting agencies. If inaccurate information is identified, it must be corrected promptly.

Duty to Correct and Update Information ( 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) : Furnishers must correct and update information when they become aware that previously provided information is inaccurate or incomplete.

Reasonable Investigation ( 1681s-2 ( b ) ) : When a consumer disputes the accuracy of reported information, creditors must conduct a reasonable investigation and provide corrections if inaccuracies are found.

Based on my review, [ insert specific details about the late payment reporting, such as the dates and nature of the incorrect reporting ], I believe this information needs to be more accurate and align with the requirements outlined in the FCRA. This inaccurate reporting negatively impacts my creditworthiness and financial well-being.

I request that the CFPB investigate this matter to ensure that [ creditor/financial institution ] complies with the FCRAs requirements. Specifically, I ask that they be directed to : Correct any inaccuracies in my credit report related to the late payment.

Ensure all future reporting adheres strictly to FCRA standards.

Provide written confirmation of the actions taken to correct these inaccuracies.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt assistance in upholding my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

This situation has placed me in a difficult position, as I am now in the process of selling my home and purchasing a new one. However, without resolution of this second mortgage, I am unable to move forward with my purchase. The uncertainty around this mortgage has not only delayed my plans but has caused significant emotional and financial stress. 

I have attached all the documents I have been able to obtain regarding this matter for your review. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or support your office can provide to help resolve this issue, as it is deeply impacting my ability to move forward with the sale of my current home and the purchase of my next home.

Despite multiple attempts and interactions with Chase customer service, each wire transfer request has been cancelled, leaving me without access to my own money for living expenses. 


In XXXX, while pursuing a XXXX XXXX XXXX in the United States, I opened a Chase bank account. This account was used for tuition payments and daily expenses, including in-store grocery shopping and online purchases on Amazon. Upon graduating and leaving the U.S. in XXXX, the account balance was approximately {$9000.00}. 

Currently residing in XXXX and needing funds for living expenses, I attempted to transfer money from my Chase account to my personal bank account in XXXX. I initiated a wire transfer request through the Chase mobile app. The sequence of events is as follows : 1.First Attempt : 1.1Within 10 minutes, received an email canceling the transfer due to security review. 
1.2Immediately called Chase customer service .

1.3After identity verification, was advised to wait 30 minutes and resubmit the transfer.

2.Second Attempt : 2.1Resubmitted the transfer to my XXXX  account as instructed. 
2.2Received identical cancellation email within minutes.

2.3Called Chase again, receiving the same advice to resubmit after account notation.

3.Third Attempt : 3.1Submitted another request for transfer to my XXXX  account. 
3.2Received same cancellation email within 10 minutes.

3.3Account locked.

3.4Called Chase for the third time.

3.5After identity verification, account unlocked.

3.6Advised again to resubmit transfer request.

4.Fourth Attempt : 4.1App requested a phone call to Chase for a one-time verification code.

4.2Called Chase to obtain the code for the transfer to my XXXX account. 
4.3Unable to locate the transaction in the app during the call.

4.4Transferred to another representative.

4.5After identity verification, received the same response : account noted, await contact from the review team.

4.5Immediately after the call, received the same cancellation email.

Throughout this process, each customer service interaction resulted in identity verification, account notation, and instructions to resubmit the transfer request to my Irish account.

Since at least XX/XX/XXXX, my credit limit has been {$10000.00}. ( See attachment 1 ) I believe my credit limit has been {$10000.00} since XXXX. 

I have always paid this account as agreed and on time. My most recent XXXX XXXX Credit Report dated XX/XX/XXXX has no adverse information. All accounts are current, paid as agreed and never late. ( See attachment 2 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email alert from Synchrony Bank that my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CARD account balance was within {$1000.00} of my credit limit. ( See attachment 3 ) I was concerned about this because I carefully manage my account and suspected an unauthorized charge of {$4000.00} or more. My credit limit was still {$10000.00} as of my last statement dated XX/XX/XXXX. ( See attachment 4 ) I logged into my account and discovered I was within {$140.00} of my NEW CURRENT credit limit of {$6000.00}. ( See attachment 5 ) My credit limit was reduced from {$10000.00} to XXXX WITHOUT NOTICE OR EXPLANATION. While online, I tried to request a credit limit increase back to {$10000.00}. The request was denied stating, Your credit limit can not be increased at this time. ( See attachment 6 ) I also received an email stating the same. Ironically, when I logged off my account, a message stated, Thank you for managing your Synchrony accounts. ( See attachment 7 ) I received an email stating the same. ( See Attachment 8 ) It appears that Synchrony Bank needs some training in customer relations. 

I responsibly manage all of my accounts because I use credit as a tool. Synchrony Banks reduction of my credit limit WITHOUT NOTICE is completely unjustified and has undermined my financial management plan and damaged my credit standing. 

I have been treated like a deadbeat that does not repay his debts. This is very insulting to me and reflects negatively on the Chevron brand. WHAT IF THIS WOULD HAVE OCCURRED WHILE TRAVELING ON VACATION? I may have discovered my new reduced credit limit had been reached while trying to pay for a hotel room or buy Chevron gas to return home. I could have been left stranded and my vacation ruined! Few people carry cash these days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( page XXXX ) stating, Based on a review of your account, Synchrony Bank has lowered your credit line to {$6000.00}. Our decision was based in part on a scoring system that was used to predict your creditworthiness. ( see attachment 9 ) I have held this account since XXXX and therefore there is no need to predict my creditworthiness. I have a proven track record at Synchrony Bank. I also have a credit history extending back into the late XXXX. 

One of the stated reasons was a lack of Real Estate Secured Loan information. I bought a home in XXXX and paid off the loan approximately in XXXX. I also paid off two car loans during that same time period. If I do not have any secured loans now, this should NOT be counted as a negative. 

Another reason listed for the decision is Too many bankcards with high balances compared to credit limit. This factor is instantly created when one or more banks, such as Synchrony Bank, lower their customers credit limit down to an existing balance. The only factor that should matter is whether or not the customer has paid consistently and on time. My most recent XXXX XXXX Credit Report dated XX/XX/XXXX has no adverse information. All accounts are current, paid as agreed and never late. ( See attachment 2 ) On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my XXXX score was XXXX and my Payment History is listed as exceptional. ( See attachment XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that the Synchrony Bank is unable to approve your credit limit increase request [ back to {$10.00}, XXXX ] at this time. The reasons for this decision are listed below : Insufficient experience at your current credit limit. [ now {$6000.00} ] ( See attachment 11 ) This reason is verifiably false and thus only serves as a pretext to deflect from an agenda of illegal discrimination in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. ( See Synchronys Environmental, Social, and Governance ( ESG ) statement < https : //investors.synchrony.com/esg > and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ( DEI ) statement < https : //www.synchrony.com/about-us/diversity > ) I have held this account since XXXX with a credit limit of {$10000.00} since at least XXXX ( I believe it has always been {$10000.00} since opened ). 

Lastly, on XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a check for {$500.00} as a payment on my account because my remaining credit was close to my new credit limit. I use this card for gasoline, groceries, and online purchases. Inexplicably, my payment did not post to my account until 10 DAYS LATER on XX/XX/XXXX. This caused me great embarrassment at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX when my card was declined for a {$74.00} purchase. ( See attachment XXXX ) This has NEVER happened to me in my life and should NOT be happening to me now considering my exceptional Credit History!

2024-09-07,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"This is a continuation of my previous [ second ] complaint against Wells Fargo Bank [ case no. XXXX ] dated XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo 's response dated XX/XX/XXXX said nothing at all, and therefore was totally unresponsive to the new issues raised in that complaint. Wells simply said that it had previously addressed my earlier [ first ] complaint dated XX/XX/XXXX, and that We did not find... any no new information that would change our ( previous ) response. However, Wells response is clearly incorrect for two reasons : 1. My second complaint discussed evidence showing that the Wells account received wired funds on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$47000.00} from XXXX Bank [ Victim # 1 ], and immediately thereafter on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX the fraudster made withdrawals totaling {$47000.00}. As a result that account had only a small remaining balance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Wells very quickly returned {$47000.00} to XXXX Bank AFTER the fraudster had already removed nearly all of those wired funds. That action was clearly contrary to Wells own statement in its previous [ first ] response : After a fraudster has obtained the funds, the wire transfer can not be reversed. Wells did not in any way address this contradiction and did not explain or justify the basis for its return of {$47000.00} to XXXX. 

2. My second complaint discussed evidence showing that on XX/XX/XXXX the fraudsters Wells account received a second wire of {$47000.00} from XXXX XXXX [ same Victim # 1 ] and also my wire of {$24000.00} from XXXX XXXX. 

The evidence further shows that Wells received fraud recall requests from XXXX XXXX regarding Victim # 1 's wired funds, to which it assigned XXXX case numbers ending in XXXX and XXXX. Wells also received a fraud recall request from XXXX XXXX regarding my wired funds, to which it assigned a XXXX case number ending in XXXX. XXXX XXXX has advised that its fraud recall request was sent to Wells at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. This evidence strongly suggests that XXXX XXXX recall request was received EARLIER than either of the two recall requests from XXXX. 

Nevertheless, on XX/XX/XXXX Wells returned funds to XXXX in the amounts of {$47000.00} and {$23000.00}, which depleted all remaining funds in the fraudsters account ; and as a result nothing was returned to XXXX XXXX. This evidence strongly suggests that my {$24000.00} wired funds which were recalled earlier by XXXX XXXX were wrongfully included in the {$70000.00} that was returned to XXXX. Rather, {$24000.00} should have been returned to XXXX XXXX, and the remaining balance of only {$46000.00} should have been returned to XXXX. Wells did not in any way address or explain or justify its actions described above. 

As discussed above, Wells Fargo has completely failed to respond in a responsible manner to my second complaint, and it must be held accountable.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,SC,29926,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10056174
2024-09-07,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX  was one of the most stressful days of my life. You probably get a lot of complaints but i truly believe this one needs to seriously be looked into considering on how reputable credit karma is and how many of us Americans use it.On XXXX of this year, I had moved all of my money over to credit karma savings as they provided a high yield compared to others. I was in the process of getting a house and they were unable to provide proper documentation needed for the purchase of the home which almost cost me to lose this house. Luckily my lender was really nice and worked really hard to try to get the information needed through other venues being that credit karma was unhelpful, unprofessional and just plain did not have the tools that they're supposed to have to be able to show where funds are sourcing from. Fast forward to about two weeks later, someone had tried to hack into my credit karma account and changed its password, i was unable to see my credit karma activity at all, my email got subscription bombed which forced me to create a new email. Also had to freeze my accounts and lock my credit cards. All my money was in credit karma, i called them over 20 times over the course of 12 hours on that day and no one helped me up to this day. I got hung up on on 90 % of the calls, they werent even able to provide me with balance, transactions made ( considering that they were threatening me to close the account due to many transactions when i only made 4 and i have 6 transactions per month on that account without repercussions ), or even basic trouble shooting for the account. All they said was "" you will receive a call within 5 business days with a solution '' when someone was trying to rob my account AT THAT MOMENT AND I NEEDED IMMMEADIATE ASSSISTANCE. They "" froze '' the account, however i was able to withdraw all my funds from the account when thats wasnt supposed to happen. Up to this day, no one got back to me, luckily i was able to withdraw my money with my account being frozen but credit karma money needs to seriously be investigated. They are such a reputable company that literally provides ZERO assistance if your account gets hacked or even if your money is in risk of getting stolen. No money got stolen from me as luckily i got up extra early that day and was able to act quickly before this ended in tragedy.

Additionally, Planet Home Lending appears to be operating without proper registration as a third-party debt collector with the Texas Secretary of State, which is required by Texas law to legally collect debts in the state.

Complaint Details : 1. Inaccurate Information on Credit Report : Planet Home Lending has placed erroneous information on my credit report, indicating an alleged debt.

2. Failure to Comply with FCRA and FDCPA : Planet Home Lending has failed to comply with the FCRA by not conducting a reasonable investigation and by not providing me with the required validation of debt. Additionally, the companys actions violate the FDCPA, as it has engaged in misleading and deceptive practices by reporting an alleged debt.

3. Non-Compliance with Texas State Requirements : Under Section 392.101 of the Texas Finance Code, a third-party debt collector must obtain a surety bond and file it with the Texas Secretary of State. Upon review, I found that Planet Home Lending is not listed in the Secretary of States database as a registered debt collector, suggesting that they are unlawfully operating in Texas without proper authorization. 


I have attached copies of all relevant documentation, including evidence of the companys non-registration and correspondence regarding the inaccurate information on my consumer reporting.

Privacy Violations : This unauthorized transfer and reporting of my personal financial information to LVNV Funding LLC is a violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), which protects my financial privacy. The handling and sharing of my information without my consent is illegal. 

Fair Credit Reporting Violations : The reporting of this collection account by LVNV Funding LLC is inaccurate and unlawful. LVNV Funding LLC is acting as a debt buyer and is required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) to ensure that the information they report is accurate and verifiable. Since I have not received any verifiable proof of the debt transfer or the legality of their collection efforts, this account must be removed.

Action Requested : I demand the immediate removal of this collection account from my credit report. 
I request that you provide proof of the debts accuracy and documentation verifying that LVNV Funding LLC has the legal right to collect this debt. 
If this issue is not resolved, I will escalate the matter with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and other appropriate government agencies for further legal action. 
Please complete this investigation promptly and notify me of the results in writing. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

2024-09-07,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"I am the owner of the loan with LoanCare. This loan was previously owned by XXXX, who have contributed to the issues with her loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I closed on a loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to purchase XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX, Florida XXXX. This loan with XXXX included a 2-1 Buydown in which the seller provided a credit to be used for an interest point buy-down for the buyer. This was explained as a relatively easy concept in which the sellers paid money, and the first year, I would pay a monthly loan amount 2 % points lower on her loan, from 6.75 % to 4.75 % for the first year. The second year, the mortgage was to go to 5.75 % on XX/XX/XXXX. However, on closing day, I discovered that I could not find the buy down paperwork within the closing documents. This created confusion and chaos on closing day and questions as to the monthly mortgage amounts being higher than initially told. These comments were ignored and ultimately, I closed after being reassured that they buy down paperwork would be in the ink signed documents. As for the monthly amount, I was never given an explanation other than once the buy down was applied, it would be lower. I ultimately paid the amount toldwhich should not have included property taxes each month for the year of XXXX, as those were paid at closing. ( See XXXX XXXX ) Despite all this confusion, I paid my mortgage every month, in the erroneous amount, through the end of XXXX. XXXX provided an Escrow Analysis, which raised my mortgage even more, due to property taxes. ( See XXXX XXXX ). I am 100 % Totally and Permanently XXXX Vet, and as such, in the State of Florida, I am exempt from property taxes in my primary residence. This benefit was applied for and approved for the home I lived in prior to purchasing my new condo. I paid XXXX taxes on that home as it was my primary residence for most of XXXX. ( See XXXX  XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I both called and emailed XXXX regarding her XXXX status and emailed my paperwork showing I am exempt from property taxes. ( See XXXX  XXXX ). They refused to do a new escrow analysis to reflect the lack of taxes, so I reduced my payments, as she stated in my email, to eliminate property taxes and requested XXXX to comply with the law and remove them from my payments. XXXX refused and called to inquire as to when she would find out about the property taxes on her primary residence. I informed them that the State of Florida did not even require the applications to be due until XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX told her to expect the information in XXXX. I did not hear back from XXXX after XXXX and I figured they were waiting for her property assessment, since taxes were not due until XXXX, it was impossible for her to be delinquent on that bill until then. 

Unknown to me, XXXX sold my loan to a new company, called LoanCare. On XX/XX/XXXX, LoanCare sent me a welcome email. After calling to confirm my loan had been sold, they informed me I was delinquent due to not paying her property taxes. I provided LoanCare the same information on XX/XX/XXXX, that was provided to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, LoanCare informed me that they were removing the property taxes from my account due to my status as a 100 % Totally and Permanently XXXX Service Vet and my exemption under Florida Law. They instructed me to pay a new amount, that was also in an amount larger than I expected, but I paid the amount on XX/XX/XXXX, until I could figure out why my loan was in such a confusing state. 

In the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from LoanCare in which they informed her me again that I was delinquent. Having made every payment on time for the existence of the loan, I believed this was again about the property taxes being removed. It was only after some back and forth with the LoanCare representative, was it discovered that LoanCare had no paperwork on my 2-1 Buy-down and believed they had purchased a loan at 6.75 %, and not the new 2nd year loan at the buy-down interest rate of 5.75 %. Immediately concerned due to the issues she had on closing day, I contacted her primary banker, XXXX XXXX XXXX, to see if he could find out what happened. ( See XXXX XXXX  ). I was sent, by the title company, the Buy-Down paperwork to sign on XX/XX/XXXX. This was the same paperwork she had requested on the day of her closing and was guaranteed to be in her closing documents on XX/XX/XXXX. It was not included in the closing documents and had to be re-accomplished 14 months later. 

At this point, since XXXX XXXX was no longer with XXXX, he contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was the Director of Closing operations at XXXX. XXXX XXXX worked with LoanCare and on XX/XX/XXXX, it seemed that everything was worked out. XXXX XXXX reported from LoanCare : I spoke with the tax and escrow teams. The tax office confirmed the customer is 100 % Veteran exemption. However the customer has to pay a Valorem tax in the amount of {$49.00} per year. The escrow team will analyze the account today. Below is the payment effective XX/XX/XXXX and the customer also has {$1800.00} in suspense that can be used for her payment. There has been no negative reporting because of the transfer and there is a stop until XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX completed XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX is {$2700.00}. XXXX reduced {$110.00} per month. Overage is {$3300.00}, will be mailed out to customer. ( See XXXX XXXX ). 

I then received a new escrow analysis, which was completely different from the XXXX Escrow Analysis just 6 months earlier. It no longer had the property taxes in it, and it also no longer claimed that she owed extra money to get rid of an escrow deficit.instead, it admitted that she was owed almost {$3400.00} in overage and seemed to have her payments correct and they were lower than what she paid in for XX/XX/XXXX. ( See XXXX  XXXX ). 

After fighting with both companies for almost six months to correct my account, to remove the property taxes that, as a XXXX veteran, I was legally exempt from paying, I finally believed that my mortgage was correct. It wasnt until I called in XXXX to confirm they had copies of my insurance, did I find out that LoanCare, despite what XXXX XXXX told me, still claimed there was a missed payment. They first said it was XX/XX/XXXX where there was a missed payment. XXXX XXXX again stepped in, but LoanCare could not even provide answers another bank could understand, let alone a consumer. I provided proof of her XX/XX/XXXX payment and she was asked for proof of XX/XX/XXXX payment, which she also provided. I requested and then later begged for them to give me an answer to what month they claim I was delinquent on so I could clear this up. LoanCare then took one month to analyze her account. LoanCare claimed to not have enough information to tell me which month they were so confident I was delinquent in at that timedespite sending her threatening letters to report her to the credit bureau and take legal action against her. How they felt they had enough information to threaten legal action, but not be able to answer her simple questions on what payments she was behind on, is truly astonishing. In addition, in XXXX threatening letters, they claimed she was not responding to them. An obvious lie, based on all the attachments to this complaint. I was in contact with them non-stop to try to resolve this issue. ( See XXXX XXXX ). 

Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, almost 5 months after the purchase of the loan from XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX from LoanCare provided a response. ( See XXXXXXXX  XXXX ) The response provided by LoanCare, after all this confusion, was nonsensical and full of bogus information. It did not explain why she should be back property taxes on the first 6 months of the year, it did not explain why they took back a credit or why. It did nothing to explain how, LoanCare, came to the realization that I owed exactly one month payment... when I never missed a full month 's payment. 

LoanCare did an escrow analysis, removed property taxes from the bill starting on XX/XX/XXXX, acknowledging my XXXX vet status, took out the taxes each month which amounted to {$370.00}. This amount was almost the exact same amount I reduced from my payments to XXXX, starting in XX/XX/XXXX, as I was exempt from paying the taxes, as I told XXXX. This is also the same amount that LoanCare claimed was still owed when LoanCare was transferred her loan. It was at this time, after additional investigating, that I found out XXXX reported me delinquent to credit agencies, for taxes I did not owe. XXXX has since removed the delinquent notice to the credit agencies. 
LoanCare acknowledged in their Escrow Analysis that I do not owe monthly property taxes in the amount of {$370.00}, but then claimed that the shortfall from XXXX of {$370.00} when it was transferred to them. I do not owe payment for property taxes for any part of the year, not just for the part of the year that LoanCare approved and seems to want her to believe. I didnt owe them for any part of the 2024 year, per Florida Law. ( See XXXX  XXXX ). I made every monthly payment required. ( See XXXX XXXXXXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed this accounting provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX and requested a full review of her account be provided. A new individual, XXXX XXXX XXXX eventually responded after XXXX XXXX asked again on XX/XX/XXXX, informing her they were looking into the matter. There has been no response since and my attorney has now sent a letter similar to this complaint. 

A simple review of all the emails and correspondence I had with both banks reveals deceptive practices by both XXXX and LoanCare. Both banks provided material interference with the ability of me, the consumer to understand the term or condition of a consumer financial product or service. In addition, the banks took unreasonable advantage of my reasonable reliance on the banks to act in the interests of the consumer. From the day of closing, I expressed confusion over amounts owed as well as adequate paperwork that explained it. This turned out to be good questions to ask, because less than a year later, it was discovered the paperwork was not handled correctly, despite her best due diligence and XXXX added in property taxes that she had already pre-paid for. In addition, XXXX  XXXX Escrow Analysis was another complete disaster, which failed to account for her escrow overage and instead, increased her amounts in XXXX to cover a shortfall. XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX tried their best to assist with damage control, but there was only so much they could do, as they did not work for the new company and XXXX XXXX did not even work for XXXX any longer. 

LoanCare has repeatedly been deceptive in their communications with me. LoanCare changed their theories on what the problem was. Ranging from interest rates being incorrect, to property taxes, to refunding me money and instructing her to use a credit to pay part of a month, to then take the credit back and use that bait and switch of money to claim she was delinquent for that month as well. LoanCare has put money in and taken money out of my mortgage account with no explanation. I have begged LoanCare for answers regarding her loan for months, yet they could not provide them. LoanCare clearly engaged in deceptive banking practices. They refuse to provide a full accounting on a loan that is not that old. Yet, they still felt emboldened enough to threaten me with legal action.

Last year we received a kickback from our escrow account saying that we over paid for our taxes. I called and confirmed they stated we simply over paid, and added that extra to my principle. ( This was within the 1st year of owning our home, so knowing we may or may not have over estimated what our escrow should be. ) Our mortgage dropped from {$1600.00} a month to {$1400.00} a month. On XX/XX/XXXX with no notice my mortgage went up by {$600.00} per month! I called and originally the mortgage servicer said my taxes doubled... I called the tax assessor 's office and they said my taxes went down by {$100.00} since last year. I called the mortgage company back and they told me they made a mistake. They received the noticed from our city for due taxes late in XXXX, so they went ahead ASSUMED our taxes dropped by 50 % ( how would this ever be feasible??? ), and adjusted our mortgage, and kicked us an escrow check. We have been paying {$1400.00} since they told us we over paid ( about a year! ) Now we are footing the bill for the short escrow account and the taxes and home insurance they supposedly paid for us ( without notice our escrow was being over drawn ), which now we owe them back for. A whopping {$3800.00} if we can't do it in one lump sum, it equates to {$600.00} extra a month. I'm paying out the nose for their mistake.

At the time of the closing on XX/XX/year>, my father was also a record owner. He is also now deceased. I signed the mortgage documents as a co-borrower. 

The loan was underwritten through CrossCountry Mortgage, LLC located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I will attach a copy of the Closing Disclosure form. 

The closing was conducted by XXXX XXXX XXXX, located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 

The loan representative for CrossCountry Mortgage was XXXX XXXX. Another representative involved in the closing was XXXX XXXX. 

My parents were both born in XXXX and spoke XXXX as a second language. The reason for the refinance was to keep the monthly payments about the same while allowing some cash out in order to pay other bills. My father was XXXX  at the time of the closing and my mother was working XXXX XXXX XXXX years of age. 

The rate on the prior mortgage was 4.125 %. Again, the refinance was undertaken to realize some equity in the house to pay other bills, but keep the payments roughly the same. This meant extending the term for some years, which was fine At all times during this issue I resided with my parents in the home. It is my only residence. 

CrossCountry Mortgage stated that we could have a payment of {$1700.00} with a rate of 5.563 %. We were told that this payment included our property tax bills.

Later, we discovered that the real estate taxes were not included, which resulted in a new monthly payment of over {$2000.00}. Had we been quoted this figure prior to closing, my parents and I would have never gone through with the refinance closing.

My parents, being immigrants, as well as trusting individuals relied on the honesty and integrity of CrossCountry Mortgage. 

I realize now in scrutinizing the CD closely with the help of a real estate attorney that the taxes were not in escrow. This contradicts the express promises made to our family by the two representatives of CrossCountry.

One year later, CrossCountry contacted us to say that the taxes hadn't been paid and they were now forcing us into an escrow account and claimed that there was more than {$6000.00} owed retroactively. To say this was an unpleasant surprise to my mother is an understatement. 

We never would have taken this loan at a higher rate than our existing mortgage had we been told that the payments would exceed {$2300.00} a month. We accepted the higher rate with CrossCountry on their express promise that our payments ( with taxes included ) were going to be around XXXX XXXXXXXX. 

My mother has now passed and I live in the house alone. I can barely afford to make these monthly payments and of course regret relying on the verbal promises of unscrupulous brokers.",,CrossCountry Mortgage LLC,PA,152XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-12,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10035385

In XXXX, XXXX, I paid timely {$330.00} toward the balance on the card. I paid XXXX XXXX times the minimum payment due for that month and was still charged {$1.00} in interest. I made no charges on the card during XXXX. 

The balance due since XXXX on this card ( and previously ) is a XXXX PERCENT INTEREST PROMOTIONAL BALANCE. I have paid ENORMOUS AMOUNTS on this card in the last months. 

I called customer service Friday to find out why I was charged interest on this card. They said according to their terms of my promotion, it is up to their discretion, as to whether or not they charge interest. 

Why am I still being charged interest, when I paid off the charge in XXXX? In my opinion, with me paying XXXX XXXX times what was requested in a minimum payment over XXXX and XXXX, it is certainly bad business to charge me interest, when there were no charges in XXXX. With all credit card companies that I've dealt with, after a charge is paid off, no interest continues to accrue. Why was I charged interest at all and in particular, why was I charged interest in XXXX?

2024-09-07,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,,"I opened a line with Tally inc. several years ago. The premise of their product was that they would offer a lower interest rate than my credit card, and shift my debt onto their loan platform at the lower rate, and automatically pay off my credit cards in an optimal fashion to reduce interest costs. It worked like this for awhile. My line of credit on Tally was about {$8000.00} at an interest rate of around 11.9 %, which was far less than the cards I was paying off.

Around a year ago myself and most if not all members of the Tally community were sent an email saying that due to lack of investors, Tally would no longer be able to service our loans the same way. They said they would no longer be able to pay off and manage our card repayments with their service. Also, they let us know they were increased interest rates from the 11.9 % I had to 24.99 %. I requested information and refused payment, because this was illegal, and after excess of probably 40 emails I was only given generic copy and paste automated messages from Tally. I called and no one could tell me anything. They said they could change interest as they saw fit. 

So now, the product that they advertised as saving me money on interest, had higher interest than the original cards they came off of. It gets even worse. A few days ago I get an email that Tally is closing its door, dissolving. How nice. They sold my debt to a third party company, with no consent, with the below information.

Which means my dead that I had with Tally, will now be reported as collections. Even though it was only sent to collections because they dissolved their company after going insolvent. Tally has broken law after law after law, and now I will have an account with a non agreed upon interest rate with a collection agency and I did nothing wrong. This is absolute insanity, and I hope the government eats the executives from Tally alive, and I hope SRT is punished for purchasing manipulated debt.",,Tally Technologies,NY,11542,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Untimely response,No,,10036334

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"I am submitting this complaint against TransUnion for permitting the re-addition of deleted accounts, improper re-aging of accounts, and the inclusion of discharged bankruptcy accounts without proper verification. These accounts were previously removed from my credit report after disputes but have been re-added without proper investigation or documentation. Additionally, there is evidence that certain accounts have been re-aged to make them appear more recent than they actually are.

The practice of re-aging and re-reporting discharged bankruptcy accounts contradicts both Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) standards and bankruptcy protection laws, and it has caused continued harm to my credit report. 

Specific Issues : XXXX. Failure to Verify Accounts Properly : TransUnion allowed accounts to be re-added after being deleted, without requiring any further verification or investigation from the original creditors or debt buyers. There is no proof that these accounts have been properly validated in terms of transaction history to allow me to examine and verify, balances, dates, or my liability as I was on end of life care during the time period in question. 



XXXX. Re-Aging of Accounts : I have observed re-aging of multiple accounts, where the dates of last activity have been altered to reflect more recent dates, making these debts appear more current than they are. This tactic extends the reporting period for accounts that should no longer be listed or should be closer to expiring on my credit report under statute of limitations. 



XXXX. Reporting of Discharged Bankruptcy Accounts : TransUnion has allowed the re-reporting of accounts that were included and discharged in my bankruptcy case. These accounts were wiped out in bankruptcy and should no longer be reported. TransUnion has failed to verify that these accounts are no longer collectable and should not be appearing as adverse items. 



XXXX. Circumventing Legal Verification Requirements : The re-addition and re-aging of accounts appear to be a tactic used by debt collectors and creditors to bypass FCRA requirements, avoiding the proper steps of verification. TransUnion has failed to hold these furnishers accountable, thus violating my consumer rights.

5. Negative Impact on My Credit and Health : The continued re-reporting and re-aging of these accounts, along with the wrongful inclusion of discharged debts, has significantly harmed my credit score and increased stress, negatively impacting my health.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NV,89107,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,10035748

The account in question has the following details : Creditor Name : William Rush & Associates Account Number : XXXX Amount Delinquent : {$2400.00} Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Payment Status : Collection/Chargeoff Dispute Reason : I believe this account is being reported inaccurately in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). According to the FCRA : No Contract with Collection Agency : I do not have any contractual relationship with William Rush & Associates, and I did not authorize any such entity to collect this debt on my behalf. As per 15 U.S. Code 1692e, debt collectors must report accurate information and must not use deceptive or misleading representations.

Incorrect Reporting of Debt : According to the IRS, an unpaid charge-off is considered income. The FCRA prohibits the reporting of income as a debt. This account was reported as a charge-off and therefore should not continue to be listed on my credit report.

Request for Validation : I have requested that the creditor provide a XXXX form to prove that this debt was canceled and should be considered income. However, no such form has been provided, and the account continues to be reported inaccurately. 

Action Requested : I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and direct William Rush & Associates to provide valid documentation supporting their claim or remove this account from my credit report immediately.

If William Rush & Associates is unable to verify the legitimacy of this debt, I demand that the account be removed from all credit reporting agenciesTransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX 30 days of this notice.

2024-09-07,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"XX/XX/202XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I contacted the mortgage division of Bank of America by phone, XXXX to determine the most efficient method of paying off an existing mortgage. 
I had already previously requested and received a mortgage pay-off letter from them. Bank of America Employee, XXXX in XXXX, Employee number XXXX told me that she could transfer the payoff from my savings to the mortgage loan account. 
I agreed and she submitted the payoff of USD XXXX and told me the transaction was complete. 
I requested either a confirmation number or a transaction number. She said she was unable to supply me with either, only her employee number, no last name, and that I would be mailed a letter of satisfaction of mortgage within 3 business days. I stated I was not comfortable with that, and would require verification by either a confirmation number or a transaction number. She referred me to her supervisor, XXXX in XXXX, who refused to give me her employee number, and also refused to provide any documentation of any kind for the transaction. XXXX actually stated that by requesting this type of documentation I was accusing her employees of stealing. I was shocked. 
All I wanted was a confirmation number or even just a transaction number for this HUGE transaction - something, anything that would verify the transaction. I requested to speak to her manager, who was named XXXX. XXXX from XXXX, Employee number XXXX came on the phone and said no, I would not be receiving a confirmation number for this USD XXXX transaction, nor would I receive a transaction number and that I would just have to wait until I received something in the mail. 
When I told her that my online savings account showed only the fact that the XXXX was REMOVED from my savings account as a Debit Hold with no further information about where the money went, she said there was nothing more she could do, but as a courtesy, she would call me the next business morning at XXXX to confirm that my mortgage payoff went through. 
I requested an email verifying the transaction, a screenshot showing the transaction was applied to the mortgage, basically, ANYTHING that would provide a documentation trail. I even mentioned the recent XXXX banking issues as further reason for my worries. She said she could not do anything else. 
I hung up the phone, literally terrified that I could have conceivably just lost over a quarter of a XXXX dollars. It was GONE from my bank account with nothing, no electronic or paper trail to document the mortgage loan payoff.

Terrified, I called my local branch and stayed on hold for over 1 hour but never got to speak with anyone. I hung up and got in my car and drove to my local branch and met with XXXX XXXX, Senior Banker and XXXX XXXX, Assistant Manager and explained the problem. Both agreed that my concern about not having ANY DOCUMENTATION of this transaction was very concerning. They got on the phone with Bank of America headquarters, and the same information was conveyed- there would be nothing given to me to document and verify this transaction ; I would just have to wait several days until I received something in the mail. 
The bank headquarters told them to convey to me that all their phone transactions are recorded and if the money did get lost, they would have a phone recording of the transaction. How that was supposed to help me was never explained. I went home, still in shock and fear that I could conceivably just lost all that money. I never did receive a phone call from XXXX in XXXX. The next morning, XX/XX/XXXX, there was a transaction number next to the USDXXXX withdrawal from my savings, but there was no information to show WHERE all of that money had gone. 
The mortgage loan I had satisfied was no longer showing up on my online account. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received an email stating Congratulations You've paid off your loan. There were no dollar amounts listed in the letter. There was no confirmation number or transaction number associated with the XXXX that was withdrawn from my savings account to satisfy the mortgage loan. Since there is no actual confirming information in the email, it does not make sense that this would be considered adequate documentation. If you would like a copy of that, I will send it. Please keep in mind, I received it 28 hours AFTER the transaction, yet it was still not adequate documentation of the transaction, since there were no amounts paid showing.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",WA,982XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10059769

He is on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX His long-time partner with whom he lives, helps provide care. She assisted in calling back & had trouble hearing the rep. Again they would not unlock since they could not verify him. He was told the only way to unlock it was to come to branch. My father called a 5/3 banker XXXX XXXX in XXXX he knew for 40 yrs and she was not able to help. This is when I got involved. 
I am joint owner on all accts & his Attorney in Fact. I made a phone appt with a branch rep from the XXXX XXXX location in XXXX, NC. I was advised to come to a bank with my POA and to update some info & we would go from there. I made this appt for Sat XXXX. The banker for this appt, XXXX XXXX, called the day prior for more info. He advised that while he is a branch manager, its best to come in on a weekday in case we needed higher authority. 
XXXX, XXXX XXXX made copies of POA & asked me to update my fathers signature card ; I signed his name as Attorney in XXXX. While there, he called the dept ( XXXX ) needed to regain online access. XXXX XXXX told them he had POA in hand, but they stated it had to be uploaded for review. However, the phone rep said that even with the POA, my father still needed to call in to be verified. Phone rep refused to talk with me even though XXXX XXXX was verified as a branch mgr. XXXX XXXX restated my concern, if I have POA I should be able to do anything he would do at the bank. XXXX XXXX requested a manager. We stayed on hold for a long time and then we were told there was no supervisor available to help. XXXX XXXX requested that someone call him back to resolve. XXXX XXXX then told me that he would reach out to me when he had more info. 
After several days, XXXX XXXX told me ( XXXX ) he was unsuccessful, but all paperwork was uploaded & I could get access. Since I am a joint owner, I always had access. My original query and issue were getting my father back his online access. XXXX XXXX told me that my father needed to call that same number. I reiterated that he did this many times and my POA should allow me to act on his behalf. XXXX XXXX was told that was bank policy not to give password info etc. to anyone but the account holder. XXXX XXXX told me that they have noted he is in XXXX, and my father would not need to physically come in and he needed to call back. 
I told this to my father ; he sounded quite with it, so I suggested he call right then. The rep put him on hold and then the line went dead. He called back and tried again. The rep, XXXX was confused about what he needed, and his partner just said 1 word to my father- ONLINE, so that he would tell them it was for online access. The rep said that if he was on speaker phone, they would not help him. He took the phone off speaker as requested & he did perfect in relaying all his personal information to be verified. However, the rep said since someone was in the room with him and he was limited to what he could do on his phone, they would not unlock his online access even though they gave him the account balances with her in the room. My father is not always able to do this on his own. He sometimes needs assistance in dialing # s, etc.

We have gone through all the routes and done what was asked. My complaint is this : I have valid original legal Power of Attorney paperwork stating that I act as his Attorney in Fact for financial matters.

I was given a credit limit increase prior to this request on XX/XX/2024. Credit Card company affiliated with XXXX denied my credit limit increase only because there were recent hard inquiries to my account. I disagree that hard inquiries is a bad thing because I was in the process of closing my older credit cards and trying out new promotional credit cards. I closed out previous VISA credit cards upon the promotional period ending and I started to open a new credit card with Master Card per Goldman Sachs Bank USA. Apple as part of Goldman Sachs Bank USA is now wrongfully declining a new credit limit increase only because they wrongfully assumed the hard inquiries were a bad thing but where there is no actual concern for these hard inquiries as if I have bad credit history. 

Any hard inquiries do not showcase as negative understandings as if I have poor credit history. I believe my credit history showcases good credit and that the denial of a credit increase by Goldman Sachs Bank USA should be corrected as to allow a better review of XXXX credit report or other credit agency as to reflect good credit history regardless of any inquiries on the account. Inquiries are likely due to closing promotional credit cards only with a XXXX bank but have nothing to do with the good credit history of the consumer. Goldman Sachs Bank USA would wrongfully decline a credit limit increase as part of a XXXX credit report where the recent inquiries only showcase a closure of old credit cards more so and VISA promotional credit cards could not be reopened as to have to wait XXXX to reopen a new promotional credit card with a XXXX bank. Thus, any hard inquiries were likely due to the closure of promotional credit cards and having to wait to reopen promotional credit cards with the same bank as if XXXX cards belonging to the same bank are synced as if the customer is only allowed XXXX promotional credit card every XXXX years ( which was not defined because XXXX bank assumes you are a new credit card holder upon application of a new credit card, but does not recognize the previous customer history of the older credit card as if to be allowed to switch credit card promotions and end old promotional cards such resulting in hard inquiries as if I am wrongfully assumed as a new credit card customer ). 

I am challenging the denial of the credit limit increase per my active Apple credit card where the hard inquiries are not always indicative of requesting new credit card application ( as if I were an older customer switching out credit cards promotions ) and was more so the closure of old promotional credit cards and not being allowed new promotional credit cards with the same XXXX Bank only due to the XXXX waiting limit on a new promotional credit card per VISA which can result in a hard inquiry as if I am a new customer rather than a previous customer. This does not reflect any negative understandings of credit to the consumer but should be recognized as a XXXX credit card application glitch ( error ) more so as if to say this is a loyalty credit card glitch producing a hard inquiry ( instead of soft inquiry ) as to wrongfully harm the consumer ( previous customer per promotional credit card ) upon switching to a new promotional credit card per application of a new promotion only : "" Your XXXX credit report shows you've made multiple recent applications for credit, which have resulted in hard inquiries on your credit file ''",,GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA,IL,60073,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10055763

However, Wises system consistently rejects my SSN. Over an extended period, I have submitted these documents multiple times and spent hours in communication with their customer support, but no progress has been made. Instead, I was informed that in order to complete the verification process, I would need to deposit {$15000.00}, which seems unreasonable and raises concerns about the legitimacy of their requirements.Given the lack of resolution and the excessive demands, I request your assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that Wise complies with U.S. regulations. Their refusal to verify my identity without a significant deposit is impeding my access to their services, and I believe this could be a violation of consumer protection standards.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and any steps you may take to resolve this issue.Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",,TransferWise Ltd,ND,58104,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10037243

The supervisor I spoke to rejected my request for a settlement without providing any explanation, simply stating, No. They did, however, agree to send me the cardmember agreement.

When I requested proof of debt, the supervisor argued that the monthly statements constituted sufficient proof of debt and that my payments on the account implied my acceptance of the debt. I explained that I only continued making payments to protect my credit score, not as an acknowledgment of the debts accuracy.

Additionally, I was told that Discover would only consider a settlement if my account were to go 120+ days delinquent or if the account were to be sent to a law office.

2024-09-07,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to formally dispute the reporting of an account on my consumer report. This account has been inaccurately and misleadingly reported by the original creditor despite the transfer to a subsequent purchaser of the debt, in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other applicable regulations. I am demanding the immediate deletion of this account from my credit report. 

The creditor has continued to report the account as "" charged off '' every month, despite showing the balance as fully paid off and transferred to another lender. 
This is misleading and inaccurate. A charge-off is typically reported once, reflecting that the creditor has deemed the debt uncollectible and written it off. Continuous reporting of the charge-off each month, especially after the debt has been transferred or sold, is considered misleading and inaccurate under the FCRA. This is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ), which mandates that furnishers report only accurate and complete information. The ongoing monthly reporting of a charge-off is both false and deceptive when the account is no longer under the original creditor 's ownership.

The new lender has also been reporting the same debt as "" charged off and in collections. '' This results in double reporting of the same debt, creating the false appearance that two separate charge-offs exist. This duplicative reporting is extremely damaging to my credit score and financial standing and violates the FCRAs requirement for accuracy under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ). Both entities reporting the same debt as a charge-off is misleading and unfair, as it artificially inflates the severity of the accounts impact on my credit report. 

The inaccurate reporting of this account has had a profound and negative impact on my overall financial standing. Due to this duplicative and misleading reporting, I have been denied multiple credit opportunities, including credit cards, loans, and other financial products. These denials have harmed my ability to manage my financial affairs, contributing to unnecessary financial stress and losses. 

The creditors continuous inaccurate reporting is an intentional, negligent, defamatory, and unlawful FCRA violation. 
Therefore I demand that the following actions be taken immediately : 1. Complete and permanent deletion of the account from my consumer report 2. A written confirmation from your agency that this account has been fully deleted from my consumer report. 3. Compensation for damages due to the negative impact this reporting has had on my financial standing, including but not limited to a check payable to XXXX XXXX in the minimum amount of {$1000.00} for each violation, as authorized under 15 U.S.

Code 1692k for FDCPA violations and 15 U.S. Code 1681n for the following violations listed below including but not limited to : 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) Duty to Provide Accurate Information : The original creditor is in violation of this provision by reporting the account as "" charged off '' after it was fully paid off and transferred. The debt has been discharged from their ownership, and they no longer have the legal right to report it as an active liability.

15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Consumer Report Information : Credit reporting agencies have a legal duty to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information reported. Allowing both the original creditor and the purchaser of the debt to report charge-offs for the same account leads to inaccurate and duplicative reporting. This has led to significant negative consequences for my creditworthiness, resulting in unfair denials of credit opportunities.

Unfair and Deceptive Practices : Reporting this debt in a manner that falsely suggests multiple charge-offs is both unfair and deceptive. This is a violation of consumer protection laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and practices ( UDAP ). 

I demand swift resolution of this matter within 30 days from this report.",,"Upstart Holdings, Inc.",MI,480XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-09-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,10055863
