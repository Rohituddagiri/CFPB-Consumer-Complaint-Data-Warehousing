2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To Whom It XXXX Concern at XXXX, Equifax and XXXX, I am writing to express my deep concern over XXXX, Equifax, XXXX furthermore known as "" the XXXX bureaus '' failure to investigate my mailed-in disputes, resulting in a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I have received a response letter from "" the XXXX bureaus '' indicating that my mailed-in dispute request "" does not appear to have been sent directly by [ me ] or to be authorized by [ me ], '' which is not only inaccurate but also constitutes a failure to investigate my disputes as required by the FCRA. 
Let me be clear : I have never used a credit repair company or any XXXX party to submit disputes on my behalf. I am the sole author and sender of each dispute I submit to "" the XXXX bureaus '', and I have provided notarized documentation along with identification to prove my identity. There should be no ambiguity regarding the legitimacy of my mailed-in disputes. 
According to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), if a consumer disputes the accuracy or completeness of information in their credit report, the XXXX XXXX XXXX must conduct a free reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate. "" The XXXX bureaus '' refusal to investigate my mailed-in disputes on the grounds that they "" do not appear to have been sent directly by [ me ] '' is a clear violation of this provision. 
"" The XXXX bureaus '' ongoing practice of sending letters that delay the investigation process by questioning the authenticity of my disputes is unacceptable and constitutes a significant breach of my rights under the FCRA. By failing to conduct a timely and thorough investigation into my disputes, "" the XXXX bureaus '' is causing unnecessary delays, which impacts my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
I demand that "" the XXXX bureaus '' promptly address this issue by : XXXX. Opening and investigating every mailed-in dispute that I submit upon receipt. 
XXXX. Stopping the practice of sending letters that question the legitimacy of my disputes without valid grounds. 
XXXX. Complying with FCRA regulations that mandate the investigation of disputes submitted by consumers. 
If "" the XXXX bureaus '' fails to comply with these demands and continues to violate my rights under the FCRA, I will take further action, including but not limited to filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and pursuing legal remedies to enforce my rights. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I expect a response confirming that "" the XXXX bureaus '' has corrected its practices and will properly investigate my mailed-in disputes in accordance with FCRA requirements. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33313,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9794551
2024-08-10,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Recently I retired, at some point I was not able to continue making payments on my PayPal account. Prior to this situation, I had opened a crypto currently account through their site. I liked the idea because I could make purchases in small amounts. 

However, now that XXXX cant my payments as I previously did, I am unable to access my account in any form or fashion. Each and every time, I try to access the account, I always receive the following messages : something went wrong, please try again ; please enter three email accounts associated with your account ; reset your password, however, when I choose this option, it circles back to enter your email address and we will send a reset link. 

I try this every few months, only to end up in the same vicious circle. I do know that at one point I was past due with a balance of roughly {$220.00} odd dollars. However, I do believe that there was enough funds in the crypto account that would have allowed me to liquidate the account and bring my account current. However, since I was locked out of my PayPal account, I was denied the ability to use this option. 

I dont know, it I believe this practice from PayPal has to be illegal in some aspect.

I would appreciate any assistance I can get. I dont think they should be allowed to hold my funds hostage. As previously mentioned, I do believe there was enough money in the crypto account to have gotten my account back on track, but they denied me this option.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,FL,32211,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9777320
2024-08-10,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Over a period of about a week starting XX/XX/XXXX, someone began making large transactions using my credit card at XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and other stores, adding up to about {$26000.00}. When I discovered this on XX/XX/XXXX, I called chase and identified the fraudulent charges, and they removed the charges from my account and issued me a new card, so I thought everything was fine. Over the next couple of months they occasionally called me to ask for details to assist in their fraud investigation, but I couldn't think of anything unusual that happened that could've explained exactly how someone could have gained access to my card. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, they posted a letter to my account claiming that I had "" received benefit from the transactions '' and was therefore responsible for them, and immediately added the {$26000.00} of charges back to my credit card. When I tried to call and ask what this meant they were unable to provide a satisfactory answer ; the only useful thing they said was that on the date of the first fraudulent transaction, I had apparently given them a phone call telling them that it was a valid use of my credit card, but this was completely untrue : I have no memory of such a call, and my call history shows XXXX calls made or received by me on that date. When I told them this, they said they would reopen the case, but they refused to remove the charges from my account because "" that's not their procedure for reopened cases ''. This is especially annoying because the {$26000.00} of charges put me well over my credit limit, rendering me unable to use the card unless I paid a significant portion of them off ; the fraud department told me that I should be able to request a temporary credit limit increase from customer service, but when I called customer service they claimed this wasn't possible and that I just had to apply for a normal credit limit increase. I did ask to do that just as a potential temporary solution, but there's no guarantee that will go through or that it will be a large enough increase where I can avoid paying off the charges. The abruptness of charging my card with such a huge amount and their inability to provide me with prompt assistance has left me feeling extremely stressed and frustrated.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,9777532

I made my XXXX payment for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program in XX/XX/XXXX and requested loan forgiveness, and a forbearance to not require additional XXXX XXXX  monthly payments until the forbearance is applied and PSLF application is processed and loans discharged. 

Both DOE/Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) and the loan servicer MOHELA have proven incompetent and processing this request. The account has been bounced back and forth from MOHELA to Student Aid and I have received a variety of emails about "" loan transitions '' but nothing substantive about my requests for temporary forbearance and loan forgiveness, and my account currently reflects almost 90 days past due. I should not be required to make payments while the government sorts out how it will handle my loan account and processes my paperwork. 

This issue continues to cause financial and emotional distress for me and my family and I have lost countless hours having to deal with this mess created by this incompetent company. I have filed multiple complaints with MOHELA, DOE/FSA , Congressman XXXX XXXX office, and XXXX  and thus far the issue remains unresolved. I am also a class member of the putative class action litigation pending in Missouri against MOHELA and other defendants related to their incompetent handling of student loan accounts.

I have received a response letter from "" the XXXX bureaus '' indicating that my mailed-in dispute request "" does not appear to have been sent directly by [ me ] or to be authorized by [ me ], '' which is not only inaccurate but also constitutes a failure to investigate my disputes as required by the FCRA. 
Let me be clear : I have never used a credit repair company or any third party to submit disputes on my behalf. I am the sole author and sender of each dispute I submit to "" the XXXX bureaus '', and I have provided notarized documentation along with identification to prove my identity. There should be no ambiguity regarding the legitimacy of my mailed-in disputes. 
According to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), if a consumer disputes the accuracy or completeness of information in their credit report, the credit reporting agency must conduct a free reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate. "" The XXXX bureaus '' refusal to investigate my mailed-in disputes on the grounds that they "" do not appear to have been sent directly by [ me ] '' is a clear violation of this provision. 
"" The XXXX bureaus '' ongoing practice of sending letters that delay the investigation process by questioning the authenticity of my disputes is unacceptable and constitutes a significant breach of my rights under the FCRA. By failing to conduct a timely and thorough investigation into my disputes, "" the XXXX bureaus '' is causing unnecessary delays, which impacts my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
I demand that "" the XXXX bureaus '' promptly address this issue by : XXXX. Opening and investigating every mailed-in dispute that I submit upon receipt. 
XXXX. Stopping the practice of sending letters that question the legitimacy of my disputes without valid grounds. 
XXXX. Complying with FCRA regulations that mandate the investigation of disputes submitted by consumers. 
If "" the XXXX bureaus '' fails to comply with these demands and continues to violate my rights under the FCRA, I will take further action, including but not limited to filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and pursuing legal remedies to enforce my rights. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I expect a response confirming that "" the XXXX bureaus '' has corrected its practices and will properly investigate my mailed-in disputes in accordance with FCRA requirements.

Despite my repeated efforts, these bureaus continue to violate my rights under multiple federal laws, and I demand immediate action to rectify this situation. 

Violations of Federal Law : Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ] : The credit bureaus are legally required to provide accurate and verifiable information about each item on my credit report. The fraudulent accounts and inquiries listed below are clearly not mine, and the credit bureaus have failed to provide any documentation proving their legitimacy. 

12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ) : This regulation mandates that debt collectors must clearly identify the name of the creditor and any information necessary to verify the validity of a debt. The credit bureaus have not complied with this requirement, continuing to report erroneous information without proper verification. 

FCRA Section 605B [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ] : This section allows me to block fraudulent information resulting from identity theft, yet the bureaus have ignored my requests and continue to report the following fraudulent accounts and inquiries : Fraudulent Accounts : XXXX  XXXX, Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX Fraudulent Inquiries : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX, Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX FCRA Section 1681e ( b ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ] : The credit bureaus are required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum accuracy of the information they report. Their continued reporting of fraudulent accounts and inquiries, despite my disputes, demonstrates a clear violation of this obligation. 

15 U.S.C. 1692c : This statute prohibits debt collectors from contacting me regarding debts that I have clearly disputed as fraudulent. The credit bureaus persistence in reporting these items amounts to unlawful collection activity. 

15 U.S.C. 1681b : This section outlines permissible purposes for obtaining consumer reports. The inquiries listed above were not authorized by me and constitute unauthorized access to my credit information. 

My Demands : This is my third formal request for the immediate removal of the fraudulent accounts and inquiries from my credit reports. By continuing to report this inaccurate information, the credit bureaus are willfully violating federal law and causing significant harm to my financial standing. 

For each fraudulent item that remains on my credit report after this communication, I will pursue legal action and demand {$1000.00} in statutory damages per item, as well as additional compensation for the pain and suffering caused by the ongoing damage to my credit. Furthermore, I will seek punitive damages for the credit bureaus ' blatant disregard for federal law and my rights as a consumer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",PA,19121,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9794606

As a consumer protected under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to request the removal of inaccurate or outdated information from my credit report. Experian failure to comply with this law is a violation of my consumer rights and has caused me financial harm and distress. 

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Experian for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate removal of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Experian upholds its obligations under the law. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution and your assistance in rectifying this issue.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Re : Formal Complaint Against TransUnion for Violation of FCRA Section 623 Due to Reinsertion of Previously Deleted Account XXXX XXXX Dear CFPB Representative, I am writing to file a formal complaint against TransUnion for violating my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section 623, by reinserting an account that was previously deleted from my credit report due to inaccuracy and discrepancy, THIS IS A VIOLATIONG TO THE LAWS Violation of 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ), Violation of 607 ( b ) AND Violation of 611 ( d ).

Account Number : [ XXXX XXXX ] Report Date : [ XX/XX/2024 ] I am writing to file a formal complaint against TransUnion LLC regarding the reinsertion of an account that was previously removed from my credit report due to inaccuracy in THE DATE ( XX/XX/2024 ) AFTER THEY HAD RECEIVED ( ATTACH : THIS IS THE LETTER SENT TO THE XXXX DISPUTING THE INACCURACIES ) XX/XX/2024 REGARDING THE VIOLATION AND INACCURACIES THAT THE ACCOUNT HAD ON XX/XX/2024, TRANSUNION SENT ME THE NOTIFICATION OF THE DELETION OF THE ACCOUNT ( XXXX  XXXX ) TO WHICH I AM ADDING PROOF THAT IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED, BASED ON THE INACCURACIES AND DISCREPANCY THAT IT HAD BEFORE THE 30 DAYS OF THE INVESTIGATION HAD COMPLETED. 

Background On [ Date XX/XX/2024 ], I disputed an account listed on my credit report with TransUnion because the information was inaccurate. After a thorough investigation, TransUnion removed the account from my credit report in the ( date XX/XX/2024 ), acknowledging the inaccuracy. 

However, on [ XX/XX/2024 ], ( attach proof the reinsertion account ) I discovered that TransUnion had reinserted the previously deleted account into my credit report without proper notification or verification of the accuracy of the information. This action directly violates my rights under the FCRA.

This reinsertion has been done in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The specific sections of the FCRA that have been violated are as follows : Violation of Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) - Reinsertion of Disputed Information : According to this section of the FCRA, if an item is deleted due to inaccuracy, it can not be reinserted into the credit report unless the information provider certifies that the information is complete and accurate. TransUnion did not provide me with any such certification or notification within the five business days required by law. Furthermore, the consumer must be notified in writing within five business days if the information is reinserted. 

In this case, the account identified as [ XXXX XXXX ] was previously removed from my credit report after I disputed its accuracy. However, TransUnion has reinserted this account without providing me with any verification of its accuracy or completeness, nor did I receive any notification from TransUnion within the required five-day period. 

2.Violation of Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Duty to Correct and Update Information : Under this section, the furnisher of the information has a duty to correct and update the information that is found to be inaccurate. The reinsertion of the previously removed account, without correcting the inaccuracy that led to its removal, constitutes a clear violation of this duty.

3.Violation of Section 611 ( d ) - Notification of Reinsertion : This section mandates that when a previously deleted item is reinserted, the credit bureau must notify the consumer in writing and provide a summary of their rights under the FCRA. TransUnion failed to provide any such notification, leaving me unaware of the reinsertion until I checked my report. REMOVE INMEDIATLY THE ACCOUNT FOR VIOLATION TO MY RIGHT.

TransUnion has failed to provide me with the required written notice and summary of my rights after reinserting the account. This failure constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the FCRA.

4. Violation of 607 ( b ) Section 607 ( b ) of the FCRA requires credit bureaus to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports. By reinserting an account that was previously removed due to inaccuracy, TransUnion has demonstrated a failure to adhere to these procedures, resulting in a report that does not reflect accurate or reliable information.

Harm Caused The unauthorized reinsertion of this inaccurate account has caused significant harm, including potential damage to my credit score, increased stress, and the need to spend additional time and resources to correct the error. This has affected my ability to obtain credit on favorable terms and caused undue distress. Am very sad because is in the process to buy my home for my childs. please help that imposible than ONLY TRANSUNION REINSERT THIS ACCOUNT XXXX AND XXXX WAS DELETE DEFINITELY FOR INNACURATE THE PROOF IS ATTACH IN THIS COMPLAINT.

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 
YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown.

1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves. 
2. What is a FCRA violation?

1 of 4 Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you.

Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes. 
Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions. 
Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes. 
The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

Id. at XXXX ; see also XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) ( defining verify as [ t ] o prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate ). 
15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation required ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified. 
XXXX, XXXX XXXX at XXXX. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account.

I am requesting pursuant 15 USC 1681i ( 6 ) Notice of results of reinvestigation ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by the consumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to the consumer by the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher.

when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information. In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information. That provision thus contemplates that when information can no longer be verified, the proper response is to delet [ e ] it.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I am writing to you as a last resort after multiple unsuccessful attempts to resolve a matter of fraudulent accounts and inquiries appearing on my credit reports with all three major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax ). Despite my repeated efforts, these bureaus continue to violate my rights under multiple federal laws, and I demand immediate action to rectify this situation. 

Violations of Federal Law : Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ] : The credit bureaus are legally required to provide accurate and verifiable information about each item on my credit report. The fraudulent accounts and inquiries listed below are clearly not mine, and the credit bureaus have failed to provide any documentation proving their legitimacy. 

12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ) : This regulation mandates that debt collectors must clearly identify the name of the creditor and any information necessary to verify the validity of a debt. The credit bureaus have not complied with this requirement, continuing to report erroneous information without proper verification. 

FCRA Section 605B [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ] : This section allows me to block fraudulent information resulting from identity theft, yet the bureaus have ignored my requests and continue to report the following fraudulent accounts and inquiries : Fraudulent Accounts : XXXX  XXXX, Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX Fraudulent Inquiries : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX, Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX FCRA Section 1681e ( b ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ] : The credit bureaus are required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum accuracy of the information they report. Their continued reporting of fraudulent accounts and inquiries, despite my disputes, demonstrates a clear violation of this obligation. 

15 U.S.C. 1692c : This statute prohibits debt collectors from contacting me regarding debts that I have clearly disputed as fraudulent. The credit bureaus persistence in reporting these items amounts to unlawful collection activity. 

15 U.S.C. 1681b : This section outlines permissible purposes for obtaining consumer reports. The inquiries listed above were not authorized by me and constitute unauthorized access to my credit information. 

My Demands : This is my third formal request for the immediate removal of the fraudulent accounts and inquiries from my credit reports. By continuing to report this inaccurate information, the credit bureaus are willfully violating federal law and causing significant harm to my financial standing. 

For each fraudulent item that remains on my credit report after this communication, I will pursue legal action and demand {$1000.00} in statutory damages per item, as well as additional compensation for the pain and suffering caused by the ongoing damage to my credit. Furthermore, I will seek punitive damages for the credit bureaus ' blatant disregard for federal law and my rights as a consumer.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",PA,19121,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9794605

Account Information : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Amount : {$9900.00} I previously submitted a dispute to Transunion regarding the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account. Despite providing evidence supporting the inaccuracies and requesting its removal from my credit report, Transunion failed to conduct a thorough investigation and the disputed account remains on my credit report.

As a consumer protected under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to request the removal of inaccurate or outdated information from my credit report. Transunion failure to comply with this law is a violation of my consumer rights and has caused me financial harm and distress.

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Transunion for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate removal of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Transunion upholds its obligations under the law.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution and your assistance in rectifying this issue.

After three weeks with no shipment, I contacted XXXX XXXX, and they informed me that it would be several months before the table would be available. I decided to cancel my order and notified XXXX, through XXXX XXXX, about the cancellation. XXXX instructed me to wait for XXXX XXXX to process the refund. 

At the end of XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX confirming the cancellation and stating that I would be refunded within XXXX business days. However, the refund did not arrive. I then opened a dispute on the XXXX XXXX app, but continued to receive non-payment notifications. When I called XXXX, they suggested opening a dispute but consistently failed to follow through. Despite my efforts to resolve the issue, including forwarding over 15 emails from XXXX XXXX, XXXX claimed they did not receive these emails and suggested I reach out to XXXX XXXX directly. 

Throughout this process, I was advised to continue making payments to avoid affecting my credit score. However, despite my clear communication that I wanted to resolve the issue and avoid credit damage, XXXX did not formally open a dispute. Consequently, they reported the issue to the credit bureaus, which severely impacted my credit score. 

This unresolved situation has placed an undue financial burden on me, hindering my ability to secure a mortgage at a reasonable rate. After exhausting all efforts to resolve the matter, I eventually paid the total amount. I have since filed a complaint with the Ohio Attorney Generals office, yet I have still not received a refund from either XXXX XXXX or XXXX, and the issue remains on my credit report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,CA,93711,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9772033

As a consumer protected under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to request the removal of inaccurate or outdated information from my credit report. Experian failure to comply with this law is a violation of my consumer rights and has caused me financial harm and distress. 
I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Experian for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate removal of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Experian upholds its obligations under the law. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution and your assistance in rectifying this issue.

Despite my efforts to resolve inaccuracies on my credit report, I have encountered several issues that I believe warrant further investigation by the CFPB. Background : O
n XX/XX/year>, I submitted a dispute to Experian XXXX, and XXXX regarding inaccurate information on my credit report. The items in question were not properly verified, yet the agency concluded that the information was accurate. I am concerned about the thoroughness and accuracy of their reinvestigation process.

Details of the Complaint : 1. Inadequate Verification Process : Despite my detailed dispute, the credit reporting agency failed to verify the accuracy of the disputed information adequately. The verification process seems to lack transparency and thoroughness, which raises concerns about its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

2. Lack of Detailed Verification Methods : I requested a detailed description of the verification methods used by the credit reporting agency, including the specific procedures, sources consulted, documentation reviewed, and criteria for validation. However, this information has not been provided, despite multiple requests.

3. Timeline of Investigation : There is a lack of clarity on the timeline of the investigation, including key dates and actions taken during the process. This lack of transparency hinders my ability to understand how the investigation was conducted and whether it adhered to FCRA requirements.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30331,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9774019

Portfolio Recovery reports a Date of Removal to XXXX as XX/XX/XXXX but a different date to Trans Union that is XX/XX/XXXX. 
Also. When disputing with the credit reporting agencies they have ILLEGALLY VERIFIED committing even more VIOLATIONS under both the FDCPA and FCRA. 
XXXX XXXX  has the audacity to send me a reply responding to my request under FCRA 623 ( A ) ( 8 ) ( E ) their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX for the Date of First Delinquency they have on file to prove different removal dates that they continue Illegally ti report differently to the credit reporting agencies that are clear RE-AGING violations.

( Please See Screenshots Attached ).

They use in haphazard fashion 15 U.S.C. Section 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 8 ) ( F ) ( i ) ( II ) illegally to avoid submitting the information I request such as the DOFD that they have on file to PROVE the true date this information will be removed from my credit report.

They bought this account from XXXX XXXX that was being reported by XXXX XXXX  as well. I disputed with XXXX XXXX  and it is no longer reporting on any of my credit reports. It was removed from all my credit reports after multiple disputes to XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX  was reporting a date of last payment as XX/XX/XXXX and it has been removed from all my credit reports. 
My question is how can XXXX XXXX continue to report knowing or should know the account has been Re-Aged. 
But somehow XXXX XXXX continues to report this RE-AGED account with a {$1900.00} Balance. XXXX XXXX # XXXX. 
reports DIFFERENTLY Date of Removal dates on Trans Union and blatantly report a different date on XXXX. There is no DOUBT this account has been illegally RE-AGED and I want it removed by XXXX XXXX because after multiple disputes with XXXX XXXX they finally are not reporting this account ending in XXXX any longer and I want XXXX XXXX to do the same.

This was clearly a billing error made my the company and is not a reflection of my payment experience which violates USC Code 1681eb. This error has caused severe hard to my reputation, my character, my mode of living and to my family!

I demand the late payment reported to be removed.

They are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law!

15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 

XXXX XXXX never sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ).

I have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9798224

Background : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a dispute to XXXX Transunion, and XXXX regarding inaccurate information on my credit report. The items in question were not properly verified, yet the agency concluded that the information was accurate. I am concerned about the thoroughness and accuracy of their reinvestigation process.

Details of the Complaint : 1. Inadequate Verification Process : Despite my detailed dispute, the credit reporting agency failed to verify the accuracy of the disputed information adequately. The verification process seems to lack transparency and thoroughness, which raises concerns about its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

2. Lack of Detailed Verification Methods : I requested a detailed description of the verification methods used by the credit reporting agency, including the specific procedures, sources consulted, documentation reviewed, and criteria for validation. However, this information has not been provided, despite multiple requests.

3. Timeline of Investigation : There is a lack of clarity on the timeline of the investigation, including key dates and actions taken during the process.

Account Information : Creditor Name : XXXXXXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Amount : {$18000.00} I previously submitted a dispute to [ Equifax ] regarding the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account. Despite providing evidence supporting the inaccuracies and requesting its removal from my credit report, Equifax failed to conduct a thorough investigation and the disputed account remains on my credit report. 
As a consumer protected under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to request the removal of inaccurate or outdated information from my credit report. Equifax failure to comply with this law is a violation of my consumer rights and has caused me financial harm and distress. 
I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Equifax for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate removal of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Equifax upholds its obligations under the law. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution and your assistance in rectifying this issue.

I requested the information that must have or possess by law in order for you to furnish a payment as late. 
This is being request pursuant rule 1002. 
In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the conditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met. 
You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late.

XXXX XXXX XXXX ; see also XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX  ) ( defining verify as [ t ] o prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate ). 
Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account. 
Delete the information you are furnishing to the Consumer Reporting Agencies as late from account.

The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. XXXX XXXX XXXX improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically XXXX, Experian, and XXXX. 

Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as XXXX, Experian, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

15 U.S. Code 1666b - Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

I requested the information that you must have or possess by law in order for you to report a payment as late.

This is being request pursuant rule 1002.

In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the conditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met.

You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late and the evidence that must be sent to you to prove that this transaction was late.

15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation required ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 

Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified. 
XXXX, XXXX XXXX at XXXX. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account. 
I am requesting pursuant 15 USC 1681i ( 6 ) Notice of results of reinvestigation ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by the consumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to the consumer by the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher.

when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information. In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am filing a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX, Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX for inaccurate reporting of a charged-off debt, violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). 

XXXX XXXX XXXX has reported a charged-off debt to Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than 180 days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to provide me with a 1099-C form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, XXXX XXXX XXXX is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers. 

Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. XXXX XXXX XXXX improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX. 

Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

I have received a response letter from "" the XXXX bureaus '' indicating that my mailed-in dispute request "" does not appear to have been sent directly by [ me ] or to be authorized by [ me ], '' which is not only inaccurate but also constitutes a failure to investigate my disputes as required by the FCRA. 
Let me be clear : I have never used a credit repair company or any third party to submit disputes on my behalf. I am the sole author and sender of each dispute I submit to "" the XXXX bureaus '', and I have provided notarized documentation along with identification to prove my identity. There should be no ambiguity regarding the legitimacy of my mailed-in disputes. 
According to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), if a consumer disputes the accuracy or completeness of information in their credit report, the credit reporting agency must conduct a free reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate. "" The XXXX bureaus '' refusal to investigate my mailed-in disputes on the grounds that they "" do not appear to have been sent directly by [ me ] '' is a clear violation of this provision. 
"" The XXXX bureaus '' ongoing practice of sending letters that delay the investigation process by questioning the authenticity of my disputes is unacceptable and constitutes a significant breach of my rights under the FCRA. By failing to conduct a timely and thorough investigation into my disputes, "" the XXXX bureaus '' is causing unnecessary delays, which impacts my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
I demand that "" the XXXX bureaus '' promptly address this issue by : 1. Opening and investigating every mailed-in dispute that I submit upon receipt.

2. Stopping the practice of sending letters that question the legitimacy of my disputes without valid grounds.

3. Complying with FCRA regulations that mandate the investigation of disputes submitted by consumers. 
If "" the XXXX bureaus '' fails to comply with these demands and continues to violate my rights under the FCRA, I will take further action, including but not limited to filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and pursuing legal remedies to enforce my rights. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I expect a response confirming that "" the XXXX bureaus '' has corrected its practices and will properly investigate my mailed-in disputes in accordance with FCRA requirements.

Apparently the XXXX XXXX website saved my debit card on file from the last time I ordered food from there at my location here in XXXX. The person who ordered the food somehow hacked my XXXX XXXX account. I emailed XXXX XXXX customer service and they've agreed cooperate with any investigation. I was at work ( here in XXXX XXXX XXXX Tx ) at the time this happened. I submitted a claim to Regions Bank which they closed and denied the very next day without asking me anything. I never even got a confirmation email that was received which is standard practice. Regions still hit me with an overdraft fee for each of those fraudulent transactions even though a dispute had already been submitted for them. When I called the bank to complain about the charges, is when I learned they closed and denied my claim without any investigation which should also be a standard practice being that it is a dispute. The representative told the reason it was denied is because I did not dispute transactions I actually made at my XXXX XXXX a month or 2 ago. OBVIOUSLY ITS BECAUSE THOSE ARE LEGIT PURCHASES I MADE GENIUSES! And it was not even a question on their online dispute form! It never asked about other transactions with XXXX XXXX from last month.

I had the email confirmation for the orders that were being delivered to someone in Washington. I have my timecard which shows I was working at the time!! But you didn't ask for anything!! Then just closed my claim and charged me {$160.00} for the overdraft those transactions caused me!! Talk about predatory!! You should not be allowed to add overdraft fees on transactions that have been disputed!! And you seriously need to update your online dispute form! There's nowhere to upload documents and your free text box to enter additional details has a character cap so you can't even fully explain everything in that text box!

I paid {$1000.00} that day in addition to previous payments towards a stubborn balance. 


The statements says it will take 27 years to pay off. 


So, on XXXX I authorized the settlement payments over the phone. 

I was under the impression that the payments would be withdrawn where as we discussed withdrawals from my savings account. 
*** The representative never stated that the remaining payments Needed to be made by phone every time or that I would have to set it up manually after our call for the agreement to hold. *** However, their calls are recorded and I asked the supervisor did the representative relay the information that I would need to set up the additional payments manually where as they were only authorizing a payment for that day and not any further, she said she did not hear him disclose the information or provide those necessary details. 

That disclosure/information would have been vital for success of the settlement. 

Where as the authorization I gave over the phone was my understanding of a reoccurring withdrawal authorization because we discussed a date and from which account the payments would be withdrawn. 



Solutions : I asked her if we get a new agreement and possibly at a lesser amount than before or the remaining balance ( around {$7400.00} ) and she said they were not legally required to share that information or clarify that future payments would require action by phone. 

I contacted you guys because I believe the authorization of my payments over the phone was to be automatically withdrawn.

I have paid on this credit card through financial struggle and Navy Federal has withdrawn money from my accounts without authorization because they said "" It is their right to '' they have applied + $ 18.00 % in addition to my minimum payment consistently regardless of the payments I've made. 

Before I proceed with any further payments or agreements I would like you guys to help me. I am a new mom, I just had my son in XXXX, and before COVID-19, I was a stellar member with my finances in order.

Account Information : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Amount : {$9900.00} I previously submitted a dispute to Transunion regarding the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account. Despite providing evidence supporting the inaccuracies and requesting its removal from my credit report, Transunion failed to conduct a thorough investigation and the disputed account remains on my credit report.

As a consumer protected under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to request the removal of inaccurate or outdated information from my credit report. Transunion failure to comply with this law is a violation of my consumer rights and has caused me financial harm and distress.

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Transunion for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am seeking the immediate removal of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that Transunion upholds its obligations under the law.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt resolution and your assistance in rectifying this issue.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with fraud alerts or security freezes,,"I am a victim of identity theft. The person who stole my identity was also able to obtain a copy of my credit report. With this information, they are able to call Experian and unlock, unfreeze, and remove my fraud alerts from my credit reports. This has resulted in several applications being made against my credit. They were also able to call in and change my account email, password, and phone number, and remove my XXXX security. This is all despite the fact that I have a secret question and pin number associated with the account. 

I spoke with several customer service specialists and their managers and they all told me that if someone can answer the questions derived from the credit report they can bypass the security question and the pin number. 

This is effectively telling me that there is no possible way for me to secure my credit report through Experian. XXXX and XXXX were able to add secondary measures to prevent this sort of thing from happening, but Experian did not. 

I asked for this to be escalated but have not received any response. I would like to get this resolved as the person is actively and daily attempting to gain control over my Experian account and unlock my credit report. 

I pay for the premium membership at Experian as well. The additional security features added by having a premiere account still do not help the scenario where someone can call in and answer 4 questions from the credit report. 

This was not done by accessing my account online as I have changed my username and password several times, I also have always had XXXX enabled on the account. 

Experian does not adequately protect accounts in situations where an identity thief has not only a person 's SSN but also their credit report.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Re : Formal Complaint Against TransUnion for Violation of FCRA Section 623 Due to Reinsertion of Previously Deleted Account XXXX XXXX Dear CFPB Representative, I am writing to file a formal complaint against TransUnion for violating my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section 623, by reinserting an account that was previously deleted from my credit report due to inaccuracy and discrepancy, THIS IS A VIOLATIONG TO THE LAWS Violation of 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ), Violation of 607 ( b ) AND Violation of 611 ( d ).

Account Number : [ XXXX XXXX ] Report Date : [ XX/XX/year> ] I am writing to file a formal complaint against TransUnion LLC regarding the reinsertion of an account that was previously removed from my credit report due to inaccuracy in THE DATE ( XX/XX/year> ) AFTER THEY HAD RECEIVED ( ATTACH : THIS IS THE LETTER SENT TO THE XXXX DISPUTING THE INACCURACIES ) XX/XX/year> REGARDING THE VIOLATION AND INACCURACIES THAT THE ACCOUNT HAD ON XX/XX/year>, TRANSUNION SENT ME THE NOTIFICATION OF THE DELETION OF THE ACCOUNT ( XXXX  XXXX ) TO WHICH I AM ADDING PROOF THAT IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED, BASED ON THE INACCURACIES AND DISCREPANCY THAT IT HAD BEFORE THE 30 DAYS OF THE INVESTIGATION HAD COMPLETED. 

Background On [ Date XX/XX/year> ], I disputed an account listed on my credit report with TransUnion because the information was inaccurate. After a thorough investigation, TransUnion removed the account from my credit report in the ( date XX/XX/year> ), acknowledging the inaccuracy. 

However, on [ XX/XX/year> ], ( attach proof the reinsertion account ) I discovered that TransUnion had reinserted the previously deleted account into my credit report without proper notification or verification of the accuracy of the information. This action directly violates my rights under the FCRA.

This reinsertion has been done in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The specific sections of the FCRA that have been violated are as follows : Violation of Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) - Reinsertion of Disputed Information : According to this section of the FCRA, if an item is deleted due to inaccuracy, it can not be reinserted into the credit report unless the information provider certifies that the information is complete and accurate. TransUnion did not provide me with any such certification or notification within the five business days required by law. Furthermore, the consumer must be notified in writing within five business days if the information is reinserted. 

In this case, the account identified as [ XXXX XXXX ] was previously removed from my credit report after I disputed its accuracy. However, TransUnion has reinserted this account without providing me with any verification of its accuracy or completeness, nor did I receive any notification from TransUnion within the required five-day period. 

2.Violation of Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Duty to Correct and Update Information : Under this section, the furnisher of the information has a duty to correct and update the information that is found to be inaccurate. The reinsertion of the previously removed account, without correcting the inaccuracy that led to its removal, constitutes a clear violation of this duty.

3.Violation of Section 611 ( d ) - Notification of Reinsertion : This section mandates that when a previously deleted item is reinserted, the credit bureau must notify the consumer in writing and provide a summary of their rights under the FCRA. TransUnion failed to provide any such notification, leaving me unaware of the reinsertion until I checked my report. REMOVE INMEDIATLY THE ACCOUNT FOR VIOLATION TO MY RIGHT.

TransUnion has failed to provide me with the required written notice and summary of my rights after reinserting the account. This failure constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the FCRA.

4. Violation of 607 ( b ) Section 607 ( b ) of the FCRA requires credit bureaus to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports. By reinserting an account that was previously removed due to inaccuracy, TransUnion has demonstrated a failure to adhere to these procedures, resulting in a report that does not reflect accurate or reliable information.

Harm Caused The unauthorized reinsertion of this inaccurate account has caused significant harm, including potential damage to my credit score, increased stress, and the need to spend additional time and resources to correct the error.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"After a recent review of my credit report, I discovered that Experian is reporting inaccurate information. The inaccuracies include : Monthly Payment Date Opened Balance No. of Months ( terms ) High Credit Credit Limit Past Due Payment Status Last Reported Comments Date Last Active Date of Last Payment Two-Year Payment History These inaccuracies are not only misleading but also falsely manipulate the statute of limitations. Despite my repeated requests for investigation, Experian has failed to address these discrepancies correctly, thus violating my rights. Both results returned as verified including the most recent results from XX/XX/year> ( Attached ). This inaccurate information falsely manipulates the statute of limitations. You failed to investigate this account properly after I asked you to do it TWICE and your neglect has violated my rights.

I am demanding the deletion of the inaccurate account. 

Accounts Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX DELETE this inaccurate account!!!

Specific Violations : I requested that you provide me with the name and address of the person ( s ) that you contacted to allegedly verify the information that I have rightfully disputed. But you FAILED to do so. Violating The Fair Credit Reporting Act, Public law 91-506, Title VI, Section 611, Subsection A-D FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : Experian is reporting fraudulent accounts that do not belong to me, infringing on my privacy rights. I should have sole authority over what information is considered private, and my hard inquiries and account information should not be shared without my consent.

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : Experians reporting falsely implies multiple inquiries and accounts were made by me, when in fact these are the results of fraudulent activities. This misleading reporting breaches the FCRA fairness requirements.

FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Despite previous disputes, Experian has failed to verify the accuracy of the credit information, showing willful noncompliance which could result in civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation.

FCRA Section 605B - Aggravated Identity Theft : Sharing my personal information with creditors without my consent constitutes aggravated identity theft, which carries severe penalties.

FCRA Section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information : Experian has not disclosed my right to opt out of sharing my personal information, which is deceptive and violates my consumer rights.

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Furnishing Deceptive Forms : Experian continues to furnish inaccurate inquiries and accounts without proper validation, potentially violating Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). This practice is unacceptable.

On { XX/XX/XXXX } you { Experian, XXXX, XXXX } reported an alleged transaction as Late.

15 U.S. Code 1666b - Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

15 USC 1681e ( b ) ( b ) Accuracy of report Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

I requested the information that you must have or possess by law in order for you to report a payment as late. 
This is being request pursuant rule 1002.

In other words, to properly report information as verified, the furnisher must have sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the information was true, and in doing this the conditions required by 15 USC 1666b must be met.

You failed to provide the required requested information, you failed to proceed in accordance with the requires for a creditor to treat a payment as late and the evidence that must be sent to you to prove that this transaction was late.

It has been over 30 days and you have not properly verify the information. 
Id. at XXXX ; see also XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) ( defining verify as [ t ] o prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate ). 
15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation required ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Importantly, a furnishers inability to conclusively determine that the disputed information is inaccurate does not mean that the furnisher is permitted to report back to the consumer reporting agency that its investigation verified the accuracy of that information. Instead, if the evidence available to the furnisher is insufficient to establish the truth or falsity of the disputed information, then, under the statutory framework, the furnisher must report that its investigation concluded that the disputed information can not be verified. 
XXXX, XXXX XXXX at XXXX. So, for example, if a furnisher is unable to verify that a consumer missed a payment, then it may be appropriate for the furnisher to delete any mentions of the missed payment while continuing to report other information about the account. 
I am requesting pursuant 15 USC 1681i ( 6 ) Notice of results of reinvestigation ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by the consumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to the consumer by the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher. 


when disputed information can not be verified is to delete that information. In particular, Section 1681i outlines consumer reporting agencies responsibilities in responding to consumers disputes and, like Section 1681s-2 ( b ), provides that when a disputed item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency must delete or modify it as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). Section 1681i goes on to provide that, [ f ] ollowing any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified, the consumer reporting agency must in some circumstances notify certain people who previously received a report with the now-deleted information. That provision thus contemplates that when information can no longer be verified, the proper response is to delet [ e ] it.

As of this week, Experian has only given me back XXXX points towards my score. I went from XXXX down to XXXX just for that single credit check. Experian gouged me for the single check and decided to ding me XXXX points?? What's up with that? That makes no sense and is completely unfair in my opinion and they are now being slow to give points back when I haven't done anything wrong to deserve being compensated back so slowly for what they took away in the single check. What possible reasoning could they possibly have to justify both the large gouging of points and now the slow replacement of the points? Is it some person at a desk making an arbitrary decision with no data supporting their actions? 

So to summarize : XXXX. They docked XXXX points for a single credit check, which is a ridiculous number to dock someone for a single check. Someone who has excellent credit. 

2. They are being extremely cheap in restoring my credit score back to its original XXXX points where I was at when they docked the big chunk of points back on XX/XX/year>. 

Is this just a broken system? and we are stuck with this ridiculous unfairness?

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am rejecting this response because : The Credit Bureau recent response to my complaint regarding inaccuracies on my credit report. 

Despite my numerous attempts to dispute these erroneous accounts and rectify the situation, XXXX has failed to adequately address and resolve the issues at hand. 

Over the past several months, I have repeatedly contacted The Credit Bureau, providing detailed information and supporting documentation to demonstrate the inaccuracies present in my credit report. Unfortunately, each attempt has been met with insufficient action and a lack of proper investigation into the matters I raised. This ongoing negligence has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and has had adverse effects on my financial well-being. 

I am now seeking the intervention and assistance of the CFPB to help resolve these persistent issues. The Credit Bureau failure to correct these inaccuracies and conduct a thorough investigation is a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically, they have breached my consumer rights to a fair and accurate credit report by not fulfilling their obligation to investigate disputes properly and correct any errors. 

The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate disputed information and make corrections if inaccuracies are found. 
The Credit Bureau continuous disregard for this responsibility has not only violated my rights but has also perpetuated the damages being done to me as a consumer. 

I trust that the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure that The Credit Bureau adheres to the FCRAs requirements and conducts a comprehensive review of my disputes. I am seeking a resolution that includes the correction of all inaccuracies on my credit report and a guarantee that my consumer rights will be respected moving forward.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,77459,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9772754

For the purpose of this complaint, I will attach and upload a copy of the letter originally sent as a supporting document with this complaint, along with the documentation originally sent to satisfy the 605C request per Experian 's guidelines.

Originally, I provided all the required documentation pertaining to my identification, the detailed information regarding the accounts and inquiries on my credit file resulting from trafficking that should be blocked and signatures from both myself and an authorized XXXX representative. 

Today, I received a letter in the mail which was a response from Experian ( which I will also upload as a supporting document with this complaint ) stating that they could not process my request because they could not "" reasonably confirm my identity with the proof provided ... '' ... I find this statement frivolous and unwarranted and would argue that it's a tactic credit reporting agencies use to "" buy time '' and "" procrastinate ''.

Over the past several months, I have repeatedly contacted The Credit Bureau, providing detailed information and supporting documentation to demonstrate the inaccuracies present in my credit report. Unfortunately, each attempt has been met with insufficient action and a lack of proper investigation into the matters I raised. This ongoing negligence has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and has had adverse effects on my financial well-being.

Specifically, they have breached my consumer rights to a fair and accurate credit report by not fulfilling their obligation to investigate disputes properly and correct any errors. 

The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate disputed information and make corrections if inaccuracies are found. 
The Credit Bureau continuous disregard for this responsibility has not only violated my rights but has also perpetuated the damages being done to me as a consumer.

XXXX, XXXX, and Experian are consumer reporting agencies, and as a consumer, I have the right to ensure that my private information is protected. This right is reinforced by 15 USC 6801, which mandates that financial institutions respect the privacy of their customers and protect the confidentiality of their nonpublic personal information.

The adverse account being reported by XXXX and Experian is without my permission and is against the law. Furthermore, 15 USC 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ) states that a person should not furnish information to a consumer reporting agency if they know or have reasonable cause to believe it is inaccurate. Also, 15 USC 1681e requires consumer reporting agencies to maintain procedures to prevent violations of section 1681c and to ensure that reports are furnished only for permissible purposes.

Specifically, they have breached my consumer rights to a fair and accurate credit report by not fulfilling their obligation to investigate disputes properly and correct any errors. The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate disputed information and make corrections if inaccuracies are found. The Credit Bureau continuous disregard for this responsibility has not only violated my rights but has also perpetuated the damages being done to me as a consumer. I trust that the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure that The Credit Bureau adheres to the FCRAs requirements and conducts a comprehensive review of my disputes.

You can review old credit report to show there were XXXX late payments. Please if you need to you can also review the current credit report showing XXXX late payment for XXXX. We previously had automatic payments arranged via your online portal and only noticed something was wrong when we did not see the payment being removed the following month. As soon as we noticed we paid it in full and immediately was up to date. We were informed by one of your agents that there was a system change/update that has caused previously scheduled payments to be deleted, resulting in our credit score decreasing significantly. We request that you remove this late payment history from your records and update with the credit bureaus effective immediately. Our mortgage loan consultant is requesting a letter or some type of documentation for us showing that this is being actioned as we are in the process of purchasing a new home and selling our current. PNC bank I sent all documentation too with a letter etc and never heard back so called to follow up and they did not fix the problem or even seem to care so my loan officer told me to contact you guys.

2024-08-10,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Delays in the application process,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TN XXXX XXXX Ph : ( XXXX ) XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX : Consumer Response XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Washington XXXX XXXX XXXX Complaint Regarding Repeated Requests for Documentation in Loan Assumption Process by PNC Bank Dear XXXX XXXX, I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against PNC Bank regarding their conduct during the loan assumption process for my mortgage. I believe the bank 's repeated and unnecessary requests for the same documentation are intended to frustrate and delay the process, potentially discouraging me from pursuing the loan assumption altogether. 

Background Information : Bank Name : PNC Bank Loan Number : XXXX Property Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TN XXXX Type of Loan : Conventional Date of Loan Assumption Application : XX/XX/XXXX Since I began the loan assumption process on XX/XX/XXXX, I have complied with all the requests for documentation made by PNC Bank. Despite submitting all required documents, the bank has repeatedly asked me to resubmit the same paperwork multiple times, without providing any valid explanation for these repeated requests. 

For example, on XX/XX/XXXX I sent XXXX XXXX an email to confirm that I submitted the loan application along with bank statements, proof of employment, and XXXX information for XXXX and XXXX. I also sent all the information associated with my credit and credit cards. Despite these submissions, it wasnt until XX/XX/XXXX when I received a response which stated, PNCs processes were about XXXX days behind. So, I expected a correspondence around XX/XX/XXXX since I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX. While I was waiting, and to satisfy the divorce decree, and to lower my debt to income ratio I pulled money from my investment account to XXXX out all of my credit card debt, as well as pay off XXXX XXXX, which was required via the divorce decree. On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted additional paperwork stating I had a new renter. On XX/XX/XXXX, a new person, XXXX XXXX was assigned to my case and requested more information that was not previously requested in the initial loan assumption application. I never spoke with or had any other type of communication with XXXX XXXX before or after this voicemail was left. Subsequently, XXXX days later I received email correspondence from XXXX XXXX again, which stated my application was denied and incomplete. This was only XXXX days after XXXX XXXX voicemail which I had not listened to, since I was working the night shift. Soon after I followed up with XXXX XXXX again who then stated my debt to income ratio was too high. I reminded her during our conversation that in XXXX after I had paid off all of my debt, and after I accepted a new job with better pay, I also provided documentation which included an offer letter and pay stubs, which should have indicated that my debt to income ratio was only XXXX XXXX  She suggested I then reapply instead of submitting the paperwork back to underwriting. This also led me to believe that she did not read, nor submit any of the documentation I provided in XX/XX/XXXX. Also, on this call she stated that my credit cards were not paid off and that they had pulled my XXXX XXXX in late XXXX, all of which would impact my debt to income ratio. In light of all of this, all of this should have been sent back to underwriting, but instead she chose to have me reapply. 

In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX was then assigned to my new loan assumption application, and once again I had to submit the same documentation. After I was preliminary approved, she informed me that she feared I did not have enough money for the closing. With this new information I cashed in my XXXX to ensure I had enough money for closing in XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX she also requested proof of where the {$37000.00} originated, as well as requested bank statements from my investment account along with proof that he actually deposited the check from his bank statement. It is now XXXX the XXXX, XXXX and once again, PNC Bank is requesting the same documents all over again. This cycle has continued for a year now causing undue stress and significant delays in the loan assumption process. 

The bank 's conduct has caused emotional distress because I am trying to close this chapter of my life and having to engage my ex husband repeatedly to resign documents that have already been signed, re-engaging and repaying for a notary to notarize the new documents. So, unfortunately, every time I receive documents from PNC I have hoped that they are the closing documents, but instead they are resubmission documents every single time I believe this behavior XXXX be a deliberate attempt to frustrate me to XXXX XXXX of abandoning the loan assumption process, which could be in violation of consumer protection laws and regulations. 

I respectfully request that your office investigate this matter to determine if PNC Bank is engaging in unfair or deceptive practices. Specifically, I would like : - An investigation into the bank 's handling of my loan assumption application. 
- Appropriate corrective actions taken against the bank if found to be in violation of regulations. 
- Any other relief deemed necessary to prevent further harm to myself and other consumers. 

Please find attached copies of all relevant documents, including correspondence with the bank, proof of submissions, and the documentation requested by the bank. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance in resolving this issue. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX",,PNC Bank N.A.,TN,38017,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9794389

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I am writing to you as a last resort after multiple unsuccessful attempts to resolve a matter of fraudulent accounts and inquiries appearing on my credit reports with all three major credit bureaus ( Experian, XXXX, and XXXX ). Despite my repeated efforts, these bureaus continue to violate my rights under multiple federal laws, and I demand immediate action to rectify this situation. 

Violations of Federal Law : Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ] : The credit bureaus are legally required to provide accurate and verifiable information about each item on my credit report. The fraudulent accounts and inquiries listed below are clearly not mine, and the credit bureaus have failed to provide any documentation proving their legitimacy. 

12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ) : This regulation mandates that debt collectors must clearly identify the name of the creditor and any information necessary to verify the validity of a debt. The credit bureaus have not complied with this requirement, continuing to report erroneous information without proper verification. 

FCRA Section 605B [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ] : This section allows me to block fraudulent information resulting from identity theft, yet the bureaus have ignored my requests and continue to report the following fraudulent accounts and inquiries : Fraudulent Accounts : XXXX XXXX, Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Open Date : XX/XX/XXXX Fraudulent Inquiries : XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Inquiry Date : XX/XX/XXXX FCRA Section 1681e ( b ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ] : The credit bureaus are required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum accuracy of the information they report. Their continued reporting of fraudulent accounts and inquiries, despite my disputes, demonstrates a clear violation of this obligation. 

15 U.S.C. 1692c : This statute prohibits debt collectors from contacting me regarding debts that I have clearly disputed as fraudulent. The credit bureaus persistence in reporting these items amounts to unlawful collection activity. 

15 U.S.C. 1681b : This section outlines permissible purposes for obtaining consumer reports. The inquiries listed above were not authorized by me and constitute unauthorized access to my credit information. 

My Demands : This is my third formal request for the immediate removal of the fraudulent accounts and inquiries from my credit reports. By continuing to report this inaccurate information, the credit bureaus are willfully violating federal law and causing significant harm to my financial standing. 

For each fraudulent item that remains on my credit report after this communication, I will pursue legal action and demand {$1000.00} in statutory damages per item, as well as additional compensation for the pain and suffering caused by the ongoing damage to my credit. Furthermore, I will seek punitive damages for the credit bureaus ' blatant disregard for federal law and my rights as a consumer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,PA,19121,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9771360

Upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that this account has been inaccurately reported. I have contacted the creditor/lender, but they informed me that the they no longer possess any documents related to this account. Despite this, Experian has certified the account as accurate during a previous dispute. 
This incorrect information has severely impacted my borrowing power and has led to a significant drop in my credit score. This has affected my ability to obtain credit and manage my financial responsibilities.

Given these circumstances, I am requesting the immediate removal of this account from my credit report. The presence of this inaccurate information is unjustly harming my credit profile, and I respectfully ask for a thorough re-investigation of this matter.

I previously received a paper statement in the mail and always paid the bill in full. I was forced to switch to paperless billing or incur an additional monthly fee for the paper statement. This was and remains the only credit card I have that has such a policy. The first paperless bill got lost in the almost one XXXX emails I receive on a daily basis, many of these are spam emails. When I discovered the unpaid bill, I immediately paid it with the current charges at the time. I spoke with customer service ( XXXX, ID # XXXX on XXXX2024 ) and was credited back both the late fee and interest charges as a courtesy. The current bill now shows additional interest and according to the representative for Synchrony Bank, the policy regarding interest also changed on XXXX XXXX 2024. As someone who never carries a balance and always pays every credit card in full, there would be no need for me to find this change in whatever document was supposedly sent. I just received an email today, XXXX XXXX, 2024 from Synchrony Bank, informing me of changes to the terms of the account and to log in to find out what the changes are. They seem to be changing terms at a rapid rate. According to my last bank statement : If you did not pay your balance in full in the prior billing cycle, interest will be calculated on your balance from the first day of the current billing cycle until we receive your payment in full, even if you pay your balance in full and on time and make no new charges in the current billing cycle. This interest, plus interest on that interest, will be reflected on your next billing statement. ( See attached copy ). Synchronys change in policy and paperless billing caused this error. I dont think it is right or fair to pay additional interest charges when I have paid the full balance and they even waived the fees and interest initially. They refuse to address this issue further and in a fair matter ( XX/XX/scrub>/2024 ). I have never encountered a similar situation with any other financial institution.

2024-08-10,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","Hi - The name of the mortgage company we have financed our home with is New Rez and since the beginning we have had several problems with them. However today I am reaching out to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regarding the incorrect property tax paid by New Rez/XXXX XXXX ( New Rez 's supposedly tax department ). It seems mortgage companies are required to collect a monthly amount to be held in escrow so that they can make timely and accurate insurance and tax payments. Unfortunately, these payments have never been made by New Rez on time and the only payment that was done was an erroneous payment. Our home insurance company was going to terminate our insurance because New Rez was not responding to their calls or correspondences, until they reached out to us and we made the payment immediately. Since then we have been trying to close our escrow but when we contacted escrow closure New Rez said we would need to complete a year with New Rez and show that we have paid our taxes before we could close escrow. Therefore, as soon as we received the real estate tax bill, we mailed a check to XXXX XXXX the XXXX XXXX tax collector, for the tax amount indicated on the bill on XX/XX/XXXX. On the same day I sent an email to loanservicing@newrez.com letting them that we have paid our insurance and tax payment that was due and to close our escrow account with New Rez. The next day on XX/XX/XXXX, I called them and informed them the same thing and asked New Rez to stop payment of property tax from escrow. On XX/XX/XXXX I received confirmation from the tax collector that she received our check for the tax payment and was applied to our account. Despite informing New Rez more than once to stop payment, they proceeded to make a duplicate payment of the tax amount from the escrow account. As a result, I have been following up with the tax collector regarding the status of the tax payment received from XXXX XXXX. Tax Collector confirmed that a check numbered XXXX for {$72000.00} was received from XXXX XXXXNew Rez on XX/XX/XXXX, and returned on XX/XX/XXXX via XXXX XXXX ( with tracking number XXXX ). Upon tracking this, it shows that the check returned by the tax collector reached XXXX office on XX/XX/XXXX. However, we have a voice mail from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX continuing to say that they are waiting on the status of confirmation of return of tax payment from the tax collector. We have been chasing New Rez for over 4 months requesting refund of our funds that NewRezXXXX XXXX wrongly expended. New RezXXXX XXXX have been evading by giving frivolous excuses and delaying our refund. 

Request CFPBs intervention at the earliest to help get our money back and maybe even get us compensation for all the agitation that New Rez has caused us over the past weeks to persuade mortgage companies in taking corrective action to prevent such future occurrences. Please let me know what other information you need from us to take this forward.

Later that same day I cancelled the order since I no longer wanted the item previously purchased. I received a confirmation email from XXXX that the cancellation had been successfully processed. 

Double checking my credit card transaction history, I noticed that XXXX different charges related with the cancelled order XXXX had been made to my credit card and had not been reversed. 

I proceeded to call TD Bank to see why this was happening and they told the I had to contact XXXX. I called XXXX and they told me that the had already refunded the money and that I should wait a few more days for it to be reflected. I asked them if they could reach out to TD Bank and let them know, but the said they couldn't do that and that I would have to call them myself. 

I waited a few more days and the charges had not been reversed/refunded. I called XXXX more time to TD Bank and asked to speak to a supervisor. I was kept waiting but never actually transferred to any supervisor. Instead the agent told me that she had spoken with a supervisor and that they would investigate this. I asked for a case number or reference that I could follow up but she told me there was no case number and that I had to wait for them to investigate and that I should receive a letter in my mailbox. I have not received it yet. 

I called XXXX one more time to see what was going on and I asked to speak to a supervisor. Once transferred to XXXX, I was told that they had already made the refund. I was sent an email with the alleged refunds. 

To this day the refunds have not been posted and the latest credit card statement has been generated and have balance of {$1400.00} for an order I had already cancelled on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have also reached XXXX by chat and didn't get a successful solution to this issue. Basically I have been going back and forth between XXXX and TD Bank and nobody has been able to fix this issue. I will not be paying for this balance nor any interest associated with it since I have already cancelled this purchase on XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX are consumer reporting agencies, and as a consumer, I have the right to ensure that my private information is protected. This right is reinforced by 15 USC 6801, which mandates that financial institutions respect the privacy of their customers and protect the confidentiality of their nonpublic personal information. As per 15 USC 1681, section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ), consumer reporting agencies may only furnish a consumer report with the written consent of the consumer. I have not given Equifax, XXXX, XXXX, or any financial institution my written consent to share my information. Therefore, any consent previously given, whether verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or otherwise, is hereby revoked. According to 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ), financial institutions must inform consumers of their right to opt out of the disclosure of their nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. I was not informed of this right by the information furnishers to credit agencies. Additionally, 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) states that no consumer reporting agency may include adverse information in a consumer report that is older than seven years, except for records of convictions of crimes. The adverse account being reported by Equifax and XXXX is without my permission and is against the law. Furthermore, 15 USC 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ) states that a person should not furnish information to a consumer reporting agency if they know or have reasonable cause to believe it is inaccurate. Also, 15 USC 1681e requires consumer reporting agencies to maintain procedures to prevent violations of section 1681c and to ensure that reports are furnished only for permissible purposes. XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX are failing to maintain these procedures. Lastly, under 12 CFR 1016.7, a consumer has the right to opt out at any time. I am exercising my right to opt out of the reporting services of XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NV,89135,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9794091

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 USC 1681, section 602 ( a ) emphasizes the importance of consumer reporting agencies acting responsibly with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for consumer privacy. XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX are consumer reporting agencies, and as a consumer, I have the right to ensure that my private information is protected. This right is reinforced by 15 USC 6801, which mandates that financial institutions respect the privacy of their customers and protect the confidentiality of their nonpublic personal information. As per 15 USC 1681, section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ), consumer reporting agencies may only furnish a consumer report with the written consent of the consumer. I have not given Equifax, XXXX, XXXX, or any financial institution my written consent to share my information. Therefore, any consent previously given, whether verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or otherwise, is hereby revoked. According to 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ), financial institutions must inform consumers of their right to opt out of the disclosure of their nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. I was not informed of this right by the information furnishers to credit agencies. Additionally, 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) states that no consumer reporting agency may include adverse information in a consumer report that is older than seven years, except for records of convictions of crimes. The adverse account being reported by Equifax and XXXX is without my permission and is against the law. Furthermore, 15 USC 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ) states that a person should not furnish information to a consumer reporting agency if they know or have reasonable cause to believe it is inaccurate. Also, 15 USC 1681e requires consumer reporting agencies to maintain procedures to prevent violations of section 1681c and to ensure that reports are furnished only for permissible purposes. XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX are failing to maintain these procedures. Lastly, under 12 CFR 1016.7, a consumer has the right to opt out at any time. I am exercising my right to opt out of the reporting services of XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NV,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9795213

Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), specifically 15 U.S. Code 1692j, it is unlawful to design, compile, and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief that a person other than the creditor is participating in the collection of or an attempt to collect a debt, when in fact that person is not participating. This provision was enacted to protect consumers from deceptive practices in the collection of debts. 
In my case, the account in question appears to involve deceptive practices as outlined in the statute. There is reason to believe that this account may have been furnished under misleading circumstances, potentially implying involvement from parties not actually associated with the original creditor.

Furthermore, there is case law supporting the protections under 15 U.S. Code 1692j, which underscores the illegality of such deceptive practices. I request that this account be thoroughly investigated for compliance with federal law. If any violations are found, I ask for its immediate removal from my credit report. 
Please provide me with written confirmation of your receipt of this dispute and the subsequent results of your investigation. Additionally, if you require any further information from me to facilitate this investigation, please let me know promptly.

The account in question is listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX, with account number XXXX. 
Upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that this account has been inaccurately reported. I contacted the creditor directly, but they referred me back to the credit reporting agency. Despite this, Equifax has previously verified the account as accurate.

This incorrect information has significantly impacted my credit score and overall credit health, resulting in a denial of credit and a noticeable dip in my credit score.

Given these circumstances, I am requesting that Equifax either correct the inaccuracies or remove the account from my credit report. The presence of this incorrect information is unjustly harming my credit profile, and I respectfully ask for a thorough re-investigation of this matter.

Equifax re-investigation DOES NOT PROVIDE THE PROCEDURES IN THE RE-INVESTIGATION. IT only states updated and verified. The re-investigation should have detailed information and proof that the creditor mailed off the information listed in 1637B 21 Days before the payment was due. I have requested a description of the investigation procedure 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 7 ) several times with no evidence of a true re-investigation.

Pursuant to Fair Debt Collection Practices Act "" Late payments must be validated prior to them being placed on a credit report '' This is willful failure to comply with the law and this makes Equifax criminally liable for actual, statutory, and punitive damages due to my rights being violated under FCRA.

15 U.S. Code 1681 ( G ) ( A ) 1 : The law says there is a description of the procedure attached to my file and I have the right to request all of the information in the file and Equifax has failed to do so. 

15 U.S. Code 6802- Obligations with respect to disclosures of personal information.

Transactions are payment histories, hard inquires, new open accounts, student loans, and charge offs are all personal information. This law protects my rights from any non-affiliated 3rd party company. Equifax is a non-affiliated 3rd party company reporting my personal and nonpublic information in their database without my consent. Nonpublic information means personal identifiable information.

Despite my efforts to resolve inaccuracies on my credit report, I have encountered several issues that I believe warrant further investigation by the CFPB. 
Background : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a dispute to XXXX XXXX, and Equifax regarding inaccurate information on my credit report. The items in question were not properly verified, yet the agency concluded that the information was accurate. I am concerned about the thoroughness and accuracy of their reinvestigation process.

Details of the Complaint : 1. Inadequate Verification Process : Despite my detailed dispute, the credit reporting agency failed to verify the accuracy of the disputed information adequately. The verification process seems to lack transparency and thoroughness, which raises concerns about its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

2. Lack of Detailed Verification Methods : I requested a detailed description of the verification methods used by the credit reporting agency, including the specific procedures, sources consulted, documentation reviewed, and criteria for validation. However, this information has not been provided, despite multiple requests.

3. Timeline of Investigation : There is a lack of clarity on the timeline of the investigation, including key dates and actions taken during the process.

Despite my numerous attempts to dispute these erroneous accounts and rectify the situation, XXXX has failed to adequately address and resolve the issues at hand. 

Over the past several months, I have repeatedly contacted The Credit Bureau, providing detailed information and supporting documentation to demonstrate the inaccuracies present in my credit report. Unfortunately, each attempt has been met with insufficient action and a lack of proper investigation into the matters I raised. This ongoing negligence has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and has had adverse effects on my financial well-being. 

I am now seeking the intervention and assistance of the CFPB to help resolve these persistent issues. The Credit Bureau failure to correct these inaccuracies and conduct a thorough investigation is a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically, they have breached my consumer rights to a fair and accurate credit report by not fulfilling their obligation to investigate disputes properly and correct any errors. 

The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate disputed information and make corrections if inaccuracies are found. 
The Credit Bureau continuous disregard for this responsibility has not only violated my rights but has also perpetuated the damages being done to me as a consumer. 

I trust that the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure that The Credit Bureau adheres to the FCRAs requirements and conducts a comprehensive review of my disputes. I am seeking a resolution that includes the correction of all inaccuracies on my credit report and a guarantee that my consumer rights will be respected moving forward.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",IL,601XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9796556

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Re : Formal Complaint Against TransUnion for Violation of FCRA Section 623 Due to Reinsertion of Previously Deleted Account XXXX XXXX Dear CFPB Representative, I am writing to file a formal complaint against TransUnion for violating my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section 623, by reinserting an account that was previously deleted from my credit report due to inaccuracy and discrepancy, THIS IS A VIOLATIONG TO THE LAWS Violation of 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ), Violation of 607 ( b ) AND Violation of 611 ( d ).

Account Number : [ XXXX XXXX ] Report Date : [ XX/XX/year> ] I am writing to file a formal complaint against TransUnion LLC regarding the reinsertion of an account that was previously removed from my credit report due to inaccuracy in THE DATE ( XX/XX/year> ) AFTER THEY HAD RECEIVED ( ATTACH : THIS IS THE LETTER SENT TO THE XXXX DISPUTING THE INACCURACIES ) XX/XX/year> REGARDING THE VIOLATION AND INACCURACIES THAT THE ACCOUNT HAD ON XX/XX/year>, TRANSUNION SENT ME THE NOTIFICATION OF THE DELETION OF THE ACCOUNT ( XXXX XXXX ) TO WHICH I AM ADDING PROOF THAT IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED, BASED ON THE INACCURACIES AND DISCREPANCY THAT IT HAD BEFORE THE 30 DAYS OF THE INVESTIGATION HAD COMPLETED. 

Background On [ Date XX/XX/year> ], I disputed an account listed on my credit report with TransUnion because the information was inaccurate. After a thorough investigation, TransUnion removed the account from my credit report in the ( date XX/XX/year> ), acknowledging the inaccuracy. 

However, on [ XX/XX/year> ], ( attach proof the reinsertion account ) I discovered that TransUnion had reinserted the previously deleted account into my credit report without proper notification or verification of the accuracy of the information. This action directly violates my rights under the FCRA.

This reinsertion has been done in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The specific sections of the FCRA that have been violated are as follows : Violation of Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) - Reinsertion of Disputed Information : According to this section of the FCRA, if an item is deleted due to inaccuracy, it can not be reinserted into the credit report unless the information provider certifies that the information is complete and accurate. TransUnion did not provide me with any such certification or notification within the five business days required by law. Furthermore, the consumer must be notified in writing within five business days if the information is reinserted.

In this case, the account identified as [ XXXX XXXX ] was previously removed from my credit report after I disputed its accuracy. However, TransUnion has reinserted this account without providing me with any verification of its accuracy or completeness, nor did I receive any notification from TransUnion within the required five-day period.

2.Violation of Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Duty to Correct and Update Information : Under this section, the furnisher of the information has a duty to correct and update the information that is found to be inaccurate. The reinsertion of the previously removed account, without correcting the inaccuracy that led to its removal, constitutes a clear violation of this duty.

3.Violation of Section 611 ( d ) - Notification of Reinsertion : This section mandates that when a previously deleted item is reinserted, the credit bureau must notify the consumer in writing and provide a summary of their rights under the FCRA. TransUnion failed to provide any such notification, leaving me unaware of the reinsertion until I checked my report. REMOVE INMEDIATLY THE ACCOUNT FOR VIOLATION TO MY RIGHT.

TransUnion has failed to provide me with the required written notice and summary of my rights after reinserting the account. This failure constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the FCRA.

4. Violation of 607 ( b ) Section 607 ( b ) of the FCRA requires credit bureaus to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports. By reinserting an account that was previously removed due to inaccuracy, TransUnion has demonstrated a failure to adhere to these procedures, resulting in a report that does not reflect accurate or reliable information.

Harm Caused The unauthorized reinsertion of this inaccurate account has caused significant harm, including potential damage to my credit score, increased stress, and the need to spend additional time and resources to correct the error. This has affected my ability to obtain credit on favorable terms and caused undue distress. Am very sad because is in the process to buy my home for my childs. please help that imposible than ONLY TRANSUNION REINSERT THIS ACCOUNT XXXX AND XXXX WAS DELETE DEFINITELY FOR INNACURATE THE PROOF IS ATTACH IN THIS COMPLAINT. AND THE PICTURES IS VERY CLEAR.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,33141,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9794689
2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am filing a formal complaint against TransUnion regarding their refusal to investigate and correct inaccurate information on my credit report, as detailed in their recent message to me dated XX/XX/year>, under File Number : XXXX. 

Background : I recently initiated a dispute with TransUnion to correct inaccuracies in my credit report. However, I received a response from TransUnion stating that they did not process my request because they claimed it did not appear to come directly from me or a properly authorized third party. This is inaccurate, as I submitted the dispute myself and have not engaged any third-party services to handle my credit disputes. Furthermore, the inaccuracies on my credit report are having a significant negative impact on my credit score and my ability to secure a mortgage, as I am in the process of purchasing a home. 

Issues : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), TransUnion is required to conduct a reasonable investigation when a consumer disputes the accuracy of information on their credit report. TransUnions refusal to investigate based on their incorrect assumption that my request was not submitted directly by me is a clear violation of this provision. 

2. Right to Accurate Credit Reporting : The FCRA also stipulates that credit reporting agencies must report accurate information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). The inaccurate items on my credit report have not been addressed, despite my legitimate dispute. This failure to correct inaccurate information is damaging my creditworthiness and is preventing me from accessing essential financial opportunities. 

3. Potential Violation of Consumer Rights : TransUnions suggestion that I may be working with an unauthorized third party, and their failure to act on my legitimate dispute, not only delays the correction of inaccuracies but also implies a potential violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA. 

Requested Resolution : I am requesting the CFPBs assistance to ensure that TransUnion : 1. Immediately conducts a thorough and reasonable investigation into the disputed items on my credit report, as per FCRA requirements.

2. Corrects or deletes the inaccurate information from my credit report.

3. Provides a detailed explanation of the steps they took to investigate my dispute and the rationale behind their decisions. 

The inaccurate information on my credit report is unfairly hindering my ability to purchase a home, and I seek prompt resolution of this matter. 

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

This misreporting by TransUnion is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ). This section requires credit reporting agencies to maintain maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

This inaccuracy has negatively impacted my credit score, causing undue stress and potential financial repercussions. I have made multiple attempts to rectify this issue directly with TransUnion, but the incorrect information persists on my credit report.

The lawsuit will filed due to the utter lack of response from your company. When someone is the victim of identity theft, it is simply a nightmare trying to get false information removed from a credit file. I have contacted all of the false creditors listed on my credit file. I have challenged all of the false listings on my credit file. Nothing ever happens to fix the situation. Over 90 days ago I wrote each the creditors in question and demanded proof that I am their customer. I asked for proof of the alleged debt, including specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. So far none of them has been able to provide such proof to me. I have sent follow-up letters to each of them and there is still no proof. I have attempted phone contact, but I simply get transferred around and nothing ever gets accomplished. I have fully investigated my rights in this matter. Under the doctrine of estoppel by silence, XXXX v XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I may presume that no proof of the alleged debt, nor therefore any such debt, in fact exists. I have copies of the certified letters and dates prepared to bring to court. Also, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, these disputed items may not appear on my credit report if they can not be supported by any evidence. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if they can not verify the debt within 30 days, then it must be removed. Your letters to me claim to have "" verified '' the debt, but this is in fact not true under law. Simply contacting the alleged creditor and asking them to match up numbers in their database is no sufficient verification for identity theft. Of course the information matches up. Someone clearly used my information without my authorization. Now I am suing XXXX for being such a pain in the posterior to me. I have provided more than sufficient evidence to get these false accounts removed. Feel free to reach out to address this issue before it escalates legally.. via letter at my address listed at the top of this letter.

On XX/XX/XXXX, this account was removed from my TransUnion credit report, only to be re-added the following day, XX/XX/XXXX. This action is a direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 5 ) ( B ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ).

Furthermore, I am deeply concerned that TransUnion has failed to fulfill its obligation to ensure maximum possible accuracy in reporting this account, as mandated by 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). I have disputed this account multiple times, including filing identity theft reports with both the FTC and CFPB, yet the issue remains unresolved. 

This continued inaccurate reporting not only violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act but also infringes upon my rights under The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ). I demand that XXXX XXXX XXXX be permanently deleted from my credit report immediately to rectify this situation.

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 
YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. 
Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown. 
1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

1 of 4 Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you.

Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes. 
Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions. 
XXXX have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable. 
Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes.

The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

Despite my numerous attempts to dispute these erroneous accounts and rectify the situation, TransUnion has failed to adequately address and resolve the issues at hand. 

Over the past several months, I have repeatedly contacted The Credit Bureau, providing detailed information and supporting documentation to demonstrate the inaccuracies present in my credit report. Unfortunately, each attempt has been met with insufficient action and a lack of proper investigation into the matters I raised. This ongoing negligence has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and has had adverse effects on my financial well-being. 

I am now seeking the intervention and assistance of the CFPB to help resolve these persistent issues. The Credit Bureau failure to correct these inaccuracies and conduct a thorough investigation is a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically, they have breached my consumer rights to a fair and accurate credit report by not fulfilling their obligation to investigate disputes properly and correct any errors. 

The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate disputed information and make corrections if inaccuracies are found. 
The Credit Bureau continuous disregard for this responsibility has not only violated my rights but has also perpetuated the damages being done to me as a consumer. 

I trust that the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure that The Credit Bureau adheres to the FCRAs requirements and conducts a comprehensive review of my disputes.

This ongoing negligence has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and has had adverse effects on my financial well-being.

I am now seeking the intervention and assistance of the CFPB to help resolve these persistent issues. The Credit Bureau failure to correct these inaccuracies and conduct a thorough investigation is a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically, they have breached my consumer rights to a fair and accurate credit report by not fulfilling their obligation to investigate disputes properly and correct any errors.

The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate disputed information and make corrections if inaccuracies are found.

The Credit Bureau continuous disregard for this responsibility has not only violated my rights but has also perpetuated the damages being done to me as a consumer.

I trust that the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure that The Credit Bureau adheres to the FCRAs requirements and conducts a comprehensive review of my disputes.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am rejecting this response because : The Credit Bureau recent response to my complaint regarding inaccuracies on my credit report.

Despite my numerous attempts to dispute these erroneous accounts and rectify the situation, XXXX has failed to adequately address and resolve the issues at hand.

Over the past several months, I have repeatedly contacted The Credit Bureau, providing detailed information and supporting documentation to demonstrate the inaccuracies present in my credit report. Unfortunately, each attempt has been met with insufficient action and a lack of proper investigation into the matters I raised. This ongoing negligence has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and has had adverse effects on my financial well-being.

I am now seeking the intervention and assistance of the CFPB to help resolve these persistent issues. The Credit Bureau failure to correct these inaccuracies and conduct a thorough investigation is a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically, they have breached my consumer rights to a fair and accurate credit report by not fulfilling their obligation to investigate disputes properly and correct any errors.

The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate disputed information and make corrections if inaccuracies are found.

The Credit Bureau continuous disregard for this responsibility has not only violated my rights but has also perpetuated the damages being done to me as a consumer.

I trust that the CFPB will take appropriate action to ensure that The Credit Bureau adheres to the FCRAs requirements and conducts a comprehensive review of my disputes. I am seeking a resolution that includes the correction of all inaccuracies on my credit report and a guarantee that my consumer rights will be respected moving forward.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",LA,70737,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9796559

There was mention of an issue with the bank account number ( I was never asked to change or correct it ) but the payment was applied and the money no longer appeared in my account. It does say to log in to ensure it was processed which I have tried to do ( and am still trying! ) and no one at the company seems to know why I am unable to log in to my account other than as a Guest. The bank stated the money was not accepted by the servicer. I have asked them for this proof but it has not been provided. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX I got an email stating my account was overdue and that the XX/XX/XXXX account had not been applied and was in delinquency. 

The change in card servicer was apparently XXXX but I never received a new card, a new statement and my payments were made prior thru Autopay and in that short window I did not check to see that it had not gone through. 

Upon calling the company, it was discovered that when the change between the two banks were made they did not have the correct contact information, clearly a clerical issue in their database.

Violations of 15 U.S.C. 1666B Timing of Payment : This account is also reporting inaccurate late payments, violating my rights under 15 USC 1681a 15 USC 1681S-2, 15 USC 1681 2 ( A ) ( I ) & 15 U.S.C. 1666B.

According to 15USC 1681s-2 ( a ) Duty of furnishers of information to provide accurate information ( 1 ) Prohibition ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

15 USC 1666B A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

My account is set up to receive all notifications and statements by mail. However, the creditor did not follow the law, as they failed to mail or deliver any notice within 21 days before the payment due date. Without proper notice, a payment can not be legally treated as late, and the reporting of late payments is therefore both inaccurate and unlawful.

15 USC 1681 2 ( A ) ( I ) Talks about Transactions & Experiences between the consumer & the person, which persons means any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other entity, is NOT included in the consumer report it is in the Exclusion Section. This must be removed immediately because if NOT this would fall under 15 USC 1681N Civil liability for willful noncompliance.

There are also more inaccurate information that is being reported with this account as well, the account mention is also being reported as an inaccurate charge off on my credit profile that is extremely miss leading. TransUnion is furnishing inaccurate information, The erroneous charge-off is adversely affecting my credit score and, consequently, my financial health. Misreporting of Income : A charge-off is considered as income, and it is improper to report such income on a credit profile. To date, I have not received a 1099-C form related to this charge-off, which further underscores the inaccuracy of this report. Income can not be legally reported on a credit profile, and this misreporting is misleading and damaging. Lack of Permissible Purpose : Under 15 USC 1681b, consumer reporting agencies must have a permissible purpose to furnish a consumer report. According to subsection ( 2 ), this can only be done in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

According to 15 USC 6801 states It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information.

Also 15 USC 6802b - 6805 shows I have the right to opt out. 16 CFR 313.7f states how I have the right to opt out at anytime.

These laws are put in place for me as a federal protected consumer & I have the right to speak on the inaccurate information that is being furnished on my credit report, I have the right to a fair & accurate consumer report under 15 USC 1681 & TransUnion is not doing that. I am requesting for action given these clear violations I respectfully request the CFPB not only investigate the inaccuracies and violation committed by TransUnion & Ensure that TransUnion corrects or removes the inaccurate, incomplete, and unverifiable information from my credit report. Address the improper reporting of late payments, as this is a direct violation of my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1666B. These inaccuracies are unjustly affecting my credit profile and financial stability. I urge the CFPB to take swift action to rectify this situation.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,34639,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9797072

2024-08-10,Debt collection,Private student loan debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"Citizens Bank is in violation of multiple laws set forth by Congress in regards to the following account # XXXX. 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( a ) ( i ) states that the consumer report does not include information solely as to transactions or experiences ( payment history, charge off status ), between the consumer ( myself ) and the person ( CITIZENS BANK ) making the report. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681 s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) states that A person ( CITIZENS BANK ) shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer ( ME ) to any consumer reporting agency ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. CITIZENS BANK can not collect on a discharged debt. This is now considered a certificate of indebtedness per the IRS and income can not be reported. The IRS Clearly defines a charge off as Gross or Ordinary income, INCOME DOES NOT GET REPORTED ON THE CONSUMER REPORT which in fact makes reporting of this account inaccurate! By Definition, the IRS Clearly says a Cancelled debt or Charge off is Income. The reporting of this account as a debt is inaccurate. I never received a 1099-C from CITIZENS BANK for the cancelled debt of { {$52000.00} } } in order to file as ordinary income. Where is my 1099-C CITIZENS BANK is clearly writing off debt with the IRS without sending out 1099-C as required by the IRS for debts greater than { { {$600.00} } }. This is unsatisfactory! CITIZENS BANK has been HEREBY PUT ON NOTICE that they are furnishing incorrect inaccurate information. In CITIZENS BANK terms and conditions they agreed not to share my information with non affiliates. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX is not an affiliate of CITIZENS BANK nor are they "" bureaus ''. The only true credit bureau is the CFPB and they DO NOT furnish consumer reports as stated in federal law. I have a right to privacy and Per the Privacy Act of 1974 as a federally protected consumer I am now revoking any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non written, verbal, and nonverbal per 5 U.S. Code 552a. Per the FCRA as a federally protected consumer I am now opting out of any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non written, verbal, and non verbal per 15 USC 6802. I shall also point out their responsibility pursuant 15 U.S. Code section 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( ii ) : ( a ) DUTY OF FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION XXXX ) PROHIBITION ( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate ; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. CITIZENS BANK must also refund the remaining balance of the consumer account upon its termination. This is your 7 day notice to return ALL money due from this consumer account. 1026.11 Treatment of credit balances ; account termination. ( a ) Credit balances. When a credit balance in excess of { { {$1.00} } } is created on a credit account ( through transmittal of funds to a creditor in excess of the total balance due on an account, through rebates of unearned finance charges or insurance premiums, or through amounts otherwise owed to or held for the benefit of the consumer ), the creditor shall : ( 1 ) Credit the amount of the credit balance to the consumer 's account ; ( 2 ) Refund any part of the remaining credit balance within seven business days from receipt of a written request from the consumer ; ( 3 ) Make a good faith effort to refund to the consumer by cash, check, or money order, or credit to a deposit account of the consumer, any part of the credit balance remaining in the account for more than six months. No further action is required if the consumer 's current location is not known to the creditor and can not be traced through the consumer 's last known address or telephone number. ( b ) Account termination. ( 1 ) A creditor shall not terminate an account prior to its expiration date solely because the consumer does not incur a finance charge. ( 2 ) Nothing in paragraph ( b ) ( 1 ) of this section prohibits a creditor from terminating an account that is inactive for three or more consecutive months. An account is inactive for purposes of this paragraph if no credit has been extended ( such as by purchase, cash advance or balance transfer ) and if the account has no outstanding balance. ( c ) Timely settlement of estate debts ( 1 ) General rule. ( i ) Reasonable policies and procedures required. For credit card accounts under an open-end ( not home-secured ) consumer credit plan, card issuers must adopt reasonable written policies and procedures designed to ensure that an administrator of an estate of a deceased accountholder can determine the amount of and pay any balance on the account in a timely manner. ( ii ) Application to joint accounts. Paragraph ( c ) of this section does not apply to the account of a deceased consumer if a joint accountholder remains on the account. ( 2 ) Timely statement of balance ( i ) Requirement. Upon request by the administrator of an estate, a card issuer must provide the administrator with the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer 's account in a timely manner. ( ii ) Safe harbor. For purposes of paragraph ( c ) ( 2 ) ( i ) of this section, providing the amount of the balance on the account within 30 days of receiving the request is deemed to be timely. ( 3 ) Limitations after receipt of request from administrator ( i ) Limitation on fees and increases in annual percentage rates. After receiving a request from the administrator of an estate for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer 's account, a card issuer must not impose any fees on the account ( such as a late fee, annual fee, or over-the-limit fee ) or increase any annual percentage rate, except as provided by 1026.55 ( b ) ( 2 ). ( ii ) Limitation on trailing or residual interest. A card issuer must waive or rebate any additional finance charge due to a periodic interest rate if payment in full of the balance disclosed pursuant to paragraph ( c ) ( 2 ) of this section is received within 30 days after disclosure.

I have been dealing with serious identity theft issues and my bank has allowed whomever to open up credit cards and link them to my account as well as allowed fraudulent charges although mine decline. They told my that there was another charge for the same thing in XXXX of XXXX. I was not aware and when they asked how I let them know XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  for my father who had been very ill these couple of years so I missed it! They started a dispute and let me know I would only be credited for XXXX. Meanwhile, I have been paying down my credit cards and trying to minimize the damage done by these identity theft thieves. So I get a call last week and they tell me that they credited north and have to take it back. What? I couldnt even see that they credited it but I can define see that they put it back in my card. Why would they give me a credit they said they wouldnt and continue to mess with my accounts. I asked for accountability by contacting corporate. They also locked my card and I could not access my money for a couple of days and no one can tell me why. They state its fraud protection but Im the only one declining. The thieves just made a purchase on Monday which is why I had to have my card shut down and replaced. They told me I could use my digital card and it declined. Spoke to someone for over 2 hours starting at XXXX on I believe Thursday and they said it was good to go. It also declined on Wednesday at a different store. Went to use it and it declined again. Had to wait until a branch opened at XXXX and speak with someone who had to do what I did but could look at my account in the computer and also see that they hadnt done what they said they were doing. The person at the branch was XXXX XXXX and he got it taken care of and gave me his number because this was a crazy, unprofessional and negligent situation Chase kept putting me in. Made no sense. This also caused a ripple affect because I was supposed to have XXXX but could not because I had to take care of my banking situation and go into places I would not have the day before XXXX. I got sick and had to reschedule so I am not happy! I have lost money, time and trust. I have been belong with Chase for almost 20 years. This is insane. Please pull the calls. There are so many including the call about the dispute where he stated they would not give more than the credit for XX/XX/XXXX. And listen to their reasoning for doing it. Conversations should be in XXXX and XXXX of this week and last week. They person that called me to take back the funds was XXXX even though I explained everything to her and could not see the transaction. And when I asked why they did it. They said they wanted to start the claim accuracy was not priority. This is my money they are playing with. And I have spent hours on the phone with them throughout the week. They state this is protection. Please also pull XXXX and/or XXXX when they allowed someone complete access to my account while adding another credit card and they did not shut my stuff down. I specifically asked how much time and what else they could have done to my account. They did not know they said they would investigate and go from there. They didnt change my debit card or suggest switching accounts. They didnt put fraud alerts on my transactions. This year with chase has been Hell!! I believe the hey locked my card in retaliation yesterday because I complained and called corporate. No one could explain it not even the branch. My kids were late to school. Hours of my life gone. {$100.00} gone. At this point they know someone has been messing with my account and they have been sort of the process for months.

According to Bank of America agents, in order to pay extra toward our mortgage principal balance we now must wait until the initial payment has cleared and then make a second payment otherwise it will be allocated automatically to the next month 's bill, therefore not reducing interest accrual. The delay they are causing means consumers will pay more in interest and we believe that many people will not bother to make the second payment meaning the bank makes more money and the consumer loses a valuable tool to pay less.

If a creditor attempts collection efforts on a discharged debt, the debtor can file a motion with the court, reporting the action and asking that the case be reopened to address the matter.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Every month, Bank of America has been furnishing incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete and unverifiable information to my consumer profile and I have made them aware of this for the past 7 months since XX/XX/XXXX. This is regarding the credit account # ending in XXXX that was charged off in XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a letters to the consumer reporting agencies requesting an investigation into the accuracy of this account which they then forwarded to Bank of America, who then had the LEGAL OBLIGATION to conduct the investigation. 

In the letter, I specified areas of inaccuracies that I had identified such as the payment history and account status. The FCRA ONLY ALLOWS up to 30 days for this initial investigation. I demanded that if the consumer reporting agencies were unable to verify the account as accurate and complete, then they should then delete this account from my profile. Also for Bank of America to cease from furnishing this account! 

The consumer reporting agencies responded back by updating the account information as verified by Bank of America. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent the the consumer reporting agencies a method of verification letter in which I requested account level documents from the data furnisher ( Bank of America ) and further proof of their verification/validation method. I again asked for the consumer reporting agencies to delete the account if they were not able to verify the information within the 15 day window that is allowed by the FCRA for this second verification/reinvestigation period. The consumer reporting agencies did NOT respond back within the 15 days, which is a VIOLATION of the FCRA! Neither did Bank of America provide them any documents to verify their method of their investigation. 

So around XX/XX/XXXX, which was well over 90 days since my initial letter was sent, I sent a complaint via the CFPB requesting that the account be deleted because the CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND BANK OF AMERICA FAILED TO PROVIDE ME WITH THE METHOD OF VERIFICATION/VALIDATION WITHIN THE 15 DAY PERIOD ALLOWED BY THE FCRA! Around XXXX, XXXX, the account seemed to have been removed by the consumer reporting agencies which led to a significant FICO score increase. 

But then it was evident that the account was reinserted days later and updated as verified by the consumer reporting agencies. They responded in their online portal and stated that Bank of America had verified the information as accurate and complete. But HOW CAN THE ACCOUNT BE verified as accurate when the original date opened was XX/XX/XXXX but there is NO PAYMENT HISTORY REPORTING until XXXX XXXX XXXX? How is the payment history accurate when the last payment date is showing as XX/XX/XXXX as well as XX/XX/XXXX? How is the payment history accurate when every month, they keep updating my account as charged off, which is re-aging my profile, which is illegal. 

It is now XX/XX/XXXX and the BOA charge off with account # XXXX is still being reported to my consumer profile! And there is still inaccurate information being reported such as the payment history, account status and date of last payment! At this point, this is willful non-compliance and deliberate reporting of inaccurate information to my consumer profile which is yet another violation of my consumer rights which are protected under the FCRA! 

I DEMAND THAT BANK OF AMERICA STOP FURNISHING THIS ACCOUNT TO THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES BECAUSE THEY ALREADY FAILED TO PROVIDE THE REQUESTED METHOD OF VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF DEBT WITHIN THE TIMEFRAME ALLOWED BY THE FCRA SINCE XXXX AND XX/XX/XXXX! I ALSO WANT BANK OF AMERICA TO STOP FURNISHING THIS ACCOUNT TO MY PROFILE BECAUSE IT INDEED HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE INCORRECT, INCOMPLETE, INACCURATE AND UNVERIFIABLE! I WANT THIS ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY DELETED FROM MY CONSUMER REPORTS AND I WANT BANK OF AMERICA TO STOP FURNISHING THIS ACCOUNT!

My agency, which exclusively serves XXXX clients, relies heavily on these funds to operate and meet financial obligations. 

Upon realizing the issue, I immediately attempted to contact WePay, only to discover that they do not have a phone number for customer support. All communication is restricted to the submission of tickets, making it nearly impossible to get timely assistance. Out of desperation, I visited my Chase bank branch, hoping for a resolution, but they were unable to help. They informed me that while WePay is associated with Chase, it operates separately, leaving me in a confusing and frustrating situation. This lack of coordination is baffling, especially given Chases heavy promotion of its small business services, which was a major reason I moved my operations to Chase in the first place. I specifically chose Chase because of its inbuilt invoicing system, which I now realize is managed by WePay, yet they have no direct way to assist me in accessing the funds that I need to operate my company. 

In compliance with their requests, I promptly provided the following : Last three months of bank statements Receipts for all my invoices Correspondence with my clients Despite countless tickets submissions, full cooperation and submission of all required documentation, both WePay and Chase have failed to provide any justification for the continued withholding of my funds. Moreover, they have not communicated any next steps or provided a timeline for resolution. 

This unexplained freezing of funds has had a devastating impact on my business, causing severe financial strain and preventing me from fulfilling my commitments to clients. Despite multiple visits to my Chase branch, I am told that all resolutions must be handled through WePay, leaving me with no clear path forward. 

As of now, my funds remain unjustly frozen without any explanation or resolution in sight, critically undermining my ability to operate my business and meet my financial responsibilities.

I was not made aware of this until calling back and once again asking them to reverse both fees, since I never received the card.

This was an illegitimate annual fee as I never received the card. In addition, I was told the fee was reversed before payment was due. I also wasn't notified that the fee was still outstanding until it was basically too late to avoid a late payment report to the credit agencies when no payment was actually due.

It has unequivocally come to my attention that PORTFOLIO has already engaged in unauthorized reporting to my credit report without obtaining my explicit consent. Federal law, as outlined in the FCRA, explicitly mandates that the consent of the consumer is a non-negotiable requirement for such reporting activities under Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ). 

In addition to federal law, Missouri state law provides specific protections for consumers regarding credit reporting. These laws emphasize the necessity of consumer consent for credit reporting and establish clear guidelines for the fair reporting of consumer credit information. 

I assert with unwavering certainty that I have not provided consent for PORTFOLIO to report any information to my credit report. This undeniable lack of explicit permission constitutes a blatant violation of my rights, resulting in potential damage to my creditworthiness and an unequivocal disregard for federal and state laws. 
I demand, with the utmost certainty, that PORTFOLIO immediately ceases any further reporting of information to my credit report without obtaining my explicit consent, as mandated by Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA and the Missouri Credit Reporting Act. Failure to comply within the stipulated 30-day timeframe will be viewed as willful noncompliance, subject to penalties under applicable laws, including identity fraud laws. 

I emphasize that obtaining consent is not a discretionary choice but a legal obligation under these specific sections of the FCRA and Missouri state law. This is not a negotiation ; it is a demand for compliance with both federal and state regulations, protecting consumers like myself from unauthorized and damaging credit reporting. 

I anticipate your immediate attention to this matter and expect that PORTFOLIO will promptly rectify these egregious violations, respecting my rights under federal and state laws.

On XX/XX/year> at XXXX, I informed the debt collector XXXX XXXX I was disputing the debt in question and that I had sent a formal dispute letter, which they should receive by [ Expected Arrival Date, e.g., XX/XX/XXXX ]. 

Despite my clear communication, the debt collector attempted to coerce me into discussing the contents of my dispute letter over the phone, which I am not legally obligated to do. When I refused, they threatened to mark my account as a refusal to pay and report this to the credit bureaus, even though the formal dispute had already been initiated. 

These actions comprise an unlawful attempt to intimidate me and violate my rights under the FDCPA, particularly the provisions that prevent debt XXXXollectors from taking adverse actions against a consumer without resolving a disputed debt. The collectors threat to report my account as a refusal to pay, despite my formal dispute, also violates my right to a fair debt resolution process and the protections afforded to me under 12 C.F.R. 1026.13 ( d ) ( 1 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1692e.

Moreover, I started receiving calls from this debt collector and, although I had been making regular payments, I realized that I had never received any statement balance or information on how much I owed or to whom I was making these payments. Concerned about this lack of transparency, I contacted the debt collector to inquire about the address where they had been sending my statements.

the debt collector has been sending mail containing my personal and financial information to the wrong address, despite me providing my correct address multiple times. This breach of cybersecurity is deeply concerning, as I do not know what sensitive information was included in the misdirected mail, and the agency has confirmed that they sent these communications to the incorrect addresses. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), financial institutions are required to ensure the security and confidentiality of consumer information, and this careless handling of my data is a clear violation of that law.

Furthermore, the debt collector provided misleading information regarding the reporting of my debt to the credit bureaus. Before this debt appeared on my credit report, I was never notified or informed that this would happen. I had been making regular payments to this collection agency, under the impression that doing so would prevent the debt from being reported to the credit bureaus. However, the debt suddenly appeared on my credit report without any prior notice. This constitutes a deceptive practice, as I was misled into believing that my payments would keep the debt off my credit report, which was not the case.

Under the FDCPA, 15 U.S. Code 1692e ( 10 ) prohibits the use of any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt. The debt collectors failure to inform me that my debt would be reported to the credit bureaus despite my payments is a clear violation of this provision.

I request that Reliant Capital Solutions be investigated for these violations, and that all negative reporting associated with this account be removed from my credit report. Additionally, I seek assurance that the agency will cease any further collection efforts on this disputed debt until the matter is fully resolved.",,"Reliant Capital Solutions, LLC",TN,373XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-11,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9777822

Upon reviewing my accounts, I came to know that the Citibank Diamond Preferred account was closed due to inactivity.

I received the letter in the mail on XX/XX/2024. My complaint is how can you execute an action on the account without notifying me in advance of the action? If the account and all of my other lines of credit are in excellent condition, why would Citibank not provide me an opportunity to avoid the account being closed? Why is my other Citibank credit card account still open and active when I haven't used that card in over 15 months as well?

I believe their actions constitute violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ).

Summary of Issues : 1. Inadequate Response to Mortgage Assistance Request : - I submitted a complete application ( Borrower Response Package ) to PHH Mortgage after my home was severely damaged due to a disaster. Despite this, PHH denied our claim for mortgage assistance without properly reviewing all the facts or contacting me to discuss the situation.

- I made multiple attempts to communicate with PHH, specifically requesting that the assigned representative, XXXX XXXX, contact me to discuss my hardship. Despite emailing several times and requesting callbacks on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I never received a response. 

2. Inappropriate Alternative Offered : - When I eventually spoke to someone in the loss mitigation department on XX/XX/XXXX, the only assistance offered was a home equity line of credit. I felt this was grossly inappropriate, as it seemed like PHH was more interested in profiting from a loan with a higher interest rate rather than providing genuine assistance to help me stay in my home.

3. Lack of Knowledge and Failure to Review : - The representative I spoke with appeared to lack knowledge about loss mitigation options. When I inquired about a forbearance, the representative was unfamiliar with the term.

- I also requested that PHH review our application with XXXX XXXX, the investor of our mortgage, but this was never done.

4. Misleading and Inaccurate Communication : - On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from PHH stating that they would not issue a lender-placed insurance policy, which I never requested. They never explained what this was or why they were doing it.

The letter also claimed that PHH 's research suggested our insurance claim would be denied, even though it was never submitted to the insurance carrier. It is unclear how they could predict this outcome without submitting the claim.

5. Poor Communication and Reassignment : - Throughout this process, PHH has failed to maintain adequate communication. Despite numerous requests, I have never spoken to my assigned account representative. The only communication I have received from PHH has been generic letters that do not indicate any real evaluation of my situation.

- Furthermore, PHH recently reassigned us to a new representative, who has also failed to reach out or respond to any emails or phone calls.

Request for Action : I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate PHH Mortgage for their handling of my mortgage assistance request and their potential violations of RESPA. I believe their failure to properly review my application, provide appropriate assistance, and maintain communication constitutes a breach of their obligations under RESPA.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

This is a real steal, XXXX cant believe the bank could do that. I tried to send them a message through XXXX and they immediately.blocked me.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am filing a complaint against World Acceptance Corporation, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX for inaccurate reporting of a charged-off debt, violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). 

World Acceptance Corporation has reported a charged-off debt to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX on my credit report. This is in violation of the FDCPA, which states that when an account is more than 180 days past due, it must generally be charged off. Despite being charged off, World Acceptance Corporation has failed to provide me with a 1099-C form, as required by IRS code 4681. 

World Acceptance Corporation has violated the FCRA ( 15 US. .Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ) by reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. Specifically, they have reported the charged-off debt without having reasonable cause to believe that the information is accurate. This has severely affected my overall score and financial stability. 
World Acceptance Corporation actions also violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 CFR 31.3 and the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. By continuing to report the charged-off account as a debt, World Acceptance Corporation is engaging in deceptive conduct that harms consumers. 

Furthermore, World Acceptance Corporation has violated my rights under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. World Acceptance Corporation improperly disclosed my personal information to credit reporting agencies, specifically XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 

Additionally, World Acceptance Corporation has violated the GLBA ( 15 U.S.C. 6802, also known as section 502 ( b ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) by failing to provide me with a clear and conspicuous notice of their intent to share my nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, such as XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. This coincides with 16 CFR 313.7 ( Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ) 16 CFR 313.10 ( Limits on disclosure of non-public personal information to nonaffiliated third parties ) and 248.124 ( Reasonable opportunity to opt out ).

-- - XXXX XXXX XXXXConsumer Financial Protection BureauXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX XXXX : XXXX Dispute of Collection Account - Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) **To Whom It May Concern : ** I am writing to formally dispute a collection account that was recently added to my credit report between XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>, by the collection agency XXXX XXXX XXXX The original creditor listed for this account is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I believe this collection account has been reported in violation of several pro

visions under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). **Specific Violations : ** 1. **Unauthorized Access and Reporting ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ) : ** Under FCRA, my consumer report can only be accessed for permissible purposes. This collection account does not have a permissible purpose, and I did not authorize the inclusion of this account on my credit report. 

2. **Communication Restrictions ( 15 U.S.C. 1692c ) : ** The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from communicating with third parties about my debt without my consent. Any communication or reporting of this debt without my explicit consent is a violation.

3. **Prohibition Against Selling Disputed Debts ( 15 U.S.C. 1692e ) : ** It has come to my attention that the debt associated with this collection account has been sold to another debt collector. This practice is deceptive and violates the FDCPA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692e, which prohibits any false, deceptive, or misleading representation concerning the collection of a debt.

4. **Validation of Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) : ** Under FDCPA, I have the right to request validation of this debt. I have not been provided with any such validation, and the debt has been sold, further complicating the matter. This lack of validation and subsequent sale is a direct violation of my rights.

5. **Reinvestigation of Disputed Information ( 15 U.S.C . 1681i ) : ** Under FCRA, if disputed information is reported to a credit reporting agency, the agency is required to conduct a reinvestigation. This collection account was added without proper investigation, and I demand a reinvestigation and removal of this account.

**Additional Violation by TransUnion : ** TransUnion has repeatedly reinserted this collection account into my credit report after its removal, which is a clear violation of FCRA. Under **15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) **, a credit reporting agency can not reinsert previously deleted information without notifying the consumer and providing documentation that the information is accurate. This repeated re-insertion without proper notification or validation is unlawful and must be addressed immediately.

Given these clear violations of federal law, I request the immediate removal of this collection account from my credit report. I also request that any subsequent debt collector be informed of this dispute and that any further attempts to collect or report this debt be ceased.

Please provide me with written confirmation of the actions taken in response to this dispute within 30 days, as required by law.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

I reached out to Chases claims department and confirmed that this transaction was unauthorized. To my surprise, I learned that unauthorized transactions with XXXX had been occurring since XXXX, which I had not been aware of. 

After resolving the initial dispute, I found a discrepancy in the refund amount. Upon further inquiry, I was informed that claims could only be filed within 60 days of the statement date. Unfortunately, many of the larger charges I initially flagged were beyond this 60-day window. 

There are still four other fraudulent charges totaling {$850.00} that I was unable to dispute because of this time limitation. 

I understand the 60-day rule, but I assure you that if I had been aware of these fraudulent charges sooner, I would have addressed them immediately. I discovered them while handling another issue, and I feel deeply violated by this situation. When I initially reached out to Chase, no one mentioned the 60-day restriction. I only learned about it when following up on the additional charges. Although I requested an exception, it was denied, with the explanation that I was informed of this policy when I opened my account nearly three years ago. 

I am asking for some understanding and compassion in this matter. I worked long hours in a demanding job and rarely checked my account, so the oversight was unintentional.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Dear MIDLAND CRED, I am writing to address a blatant violation regarding the unauthorized reporting of information to my credit report, as confirmed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under Sections 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), 1681c ( a ) ( 2 ), and 1681s-2 ( a ), and the Missouri Credit Reporting Act.

It has unequivocally come to my attention that MIDLAND CRED has already engaged in unauthorized reporting to my credit report without obtaining my explicit consent. Federal law, as outlined in the FCRA, explicitly mandates that the consent of the consumer is a non-negotiable requirement for such reporting activities under Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ). 

In addition to federal law, Missouri state law provides specific protections for consumers regarding credit reporting. These laws emphasize the necessity of consumer consent for credit reporting and establish clear guidelines for the fair reporting of consumer credit information. 

I assert with unwavering certainty that I have not provided consent for MIDLAND CRED to report any information to my credit report. This undeniable lack of explicit permission constitutes a blatant violation of my rights, resulting in potential damage to my creditworthiness and an unequivocal disregard for federal and state laws. 
I demand, with the utmost certainty, that MIDLAND CRED immediately ceases any further reporting of information to my credit report without obtaining my explicit consent, as mandated by Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA and the Missouri Credit Reporting Act. Failure to comply within the stipulated 30-day timeframe will be viewed as willful noncompliance, subject to penalties under applicable laws, including identity fraud laws.

I emphasize that obtaining consent is not a discretionary choice but a legal obligation under these specific sections of the FCRA and Missouri state law. This is not a negotiation ; it is a demand for compliance with both federal and state regulations, protecting consumers like myself from unauthorized and damaging credit reporting.

I anticipate your immediate attention to this matter and expect that MIDLAND CRED will promptly rectify these egregious violations, respecting my rights under federal and state laws.

It has unequivocally come to my attention that DISCOVERBANK has already engaged in unauthorized reporting to my credit report without obtaining my explicit consent. Federal law, as outlined in the FCRA, explicitly mandates that the consent of the consumer is a non-negotiable requirement for such reporting activities under Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ).

In addition to federal law, Missouri state law provides specific protections for consumers regarding credit reporting. These laws emphasize the necessity of consumer consent for credit reporting and establish clear guidelines for the fair reporting of consumer credit information. 

I assert with unwavering certainty that I have not provided consent for DISCOVERBANK to report any information to my credit report. This undeniable lack of explicit permission constitutes a blatant violation of my rights, resulting in potential damage to my creditworthiness and an unequivocal disregard for federal and state laws. 
I demand, with the utmost certainty, that DISCOVERBANK immediately ceases any further reporting of information to my credit report without obtaining my explicit consent, as mandated by Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA and the Missouri Credit Reporting Act. Failure to comply within the stipulated XXXX timeframe will be viewed as willful noncompliance, subject to penalties under applicable laws, including identity fraud laws. 

I emphasize that obtaining consent is not a discretionary choice but a legal obligation under these specific sections of the FCRA and Missouri state law. This is not a negotiation ; it is a demand for compliance with both federal and state regulations, protecting consumers like myself from unauthorized and damaging credit reporting. 

I anticipate your immediate attention to this matter and expect that DISCOVERBANK will promptly rectify these egregious violations, respecting my rights under federal and state laws.

( a ) Notice of debt ; contents Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 1 ) the amount of the debt ; ( 2 ) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector ; ( 4 ) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector ; and ( 5 ) a statement that, upon the consumers written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.

( b ) Disputed debts If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection ( a ) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector. Collection activities and communications that do not otherwise violate this subchapter may continue during the 30-day period referred to in subsection ( a ) unless the consumer has notified the debt collector in writing that the debt, or any portion of the debt, is disputed or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Experian and temporarily lifted my credit freeze from XXXX to XXXX. On XXXX, I had finished what I needed to do, so I called Experian to try to replace my freeze for security. Their automated phone system didn't provide that option, but it asked me if I wanted to permanently remove my credit freeze, and I very distinctly said "" NO ''. Then it said, "" Your credit freeze has been permanently removed '' and gave me no options to say that was wrong and not what I said to do. I called back, and it asked me again if I wanted to permanently remove my credit freeze, and I again said "" NO '', and it concluded OK, so I thought perhaps the previous call was a technical glitch. Then I received a letter from Experian saying my security freeze had been permanently removed. I had identity theft in XXXX documented in a police report, so this is terrible that Experian has permanently lifted my freeze, putting my credit at risk, especially when I clearly said "" No '' to lifting my freeze.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Other personal consumer report,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to express my deep frustration and anger regarding my recent experience with LexisNexis, a consumer reporting agency that I had never even heard of until they intruded into my life in the most unsettling way. All I was trying to do was shop for cheaper car insurance while diligently working on improving my credit scorea task that is hard enough without interference. However, what I discovered has left me outraged. 

Imagine my shock when I was informed by XXXX that they had obtained a report on me from LexisNexis. This report, which I had never authorized, detailed how many times I had shopped for car insurance this year. Let me be clear : I never shared this information with LexisNexis or any other third party. I was under the impression that I was simply looking at prices, browsing quotes, and gathering information. I had no idea that every click was being monitored, stored, and shared behind my back. 

But that wasnt the end of it. The report also contained details about my driving history. Again, I askhow did this information find its way into LexisNexis hands? I never gave them permission to collect or store such personal data. The fact that a company I have never interacted with can so easily compile and distribute such sensitive information without my consent is not just troublingits terrifying. 

What makes this situation even more infuriating is the impact it has had on my life. Since LexisNexis provided this unauthorized report to XXXX, I have noticed that 15 to 20 insurance companies now refuse to even provide me with a quote, let alone sell me a policy. I was just trying to find a more affordable option, and instead, Ive been effectively blacklisted, through no fault of my own. The system that was supposed to help me is now working against me, and it all leads back to LexisNexis. 

In an effort to understand how this could happen, I decided to order a consumer report on myself directly from LexisNexis. I provided them with all the necessary information : my full name, Social Security number, drivers license numbereverything they requested. Yet, in return, I received a letter stating that they couldnt identify any account associated with my name. This was not just confusingit was enraging. How is it that they couldnt find my account when I gave them all this personal information, but had no problem identifying me when XXXX requested my data? Whats even more bewildering is that XXXX doesnt have access to my Social Security number, yet LexisNexis had no trouble pulling together a report on me. 

Determined to get answers, I called LexisNexis, only to be told that I would need to provide the same personal information over the phone to verify my identity. I can not express how infuriating it was to hear that I needed to verify myself to a company that has been collecting my data without my consent for who knows how long. When I pressed the customer service representative on whether LexisNexis follows any data ethics practices, his response was chilling : "" Im afraid I dont know what that is, '' followed by a blunt admission that "" No, we just buy data from third parties ; we dont follow any data ethics premises. '' This entire experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. I feel violated, angry, and helpless. My privacy has been invaded, my personal information has been collected and shared without my consent, and now Im being penalized by insurance companies as a result. Its clear to me that LexisNexis operates with a complete disregard for consumer privacy and data ethics. 

I am filing this report with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) because this kind of behavior can not go unchecked. No company should be allowed to operate with such blatant disregard for the rights and privacy of consumers. I urge the CFPB to investigate LexisNexis and hold them accountable for their actions. This is not just about methis is about protecting every consumer from the reckless and unethical practices of companies like LexisNexis.",,LEXISNEXIS,FL,336XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9793513

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am filing this complaint regarding a serious violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which prohibits conduct that harasses, oppresses, or abuses any person in connection with debt collection. An unknown third-party collection agency has reported an alleged debt from 2019 on my credit file, despite this debt having been previously disputed and removed. This action not only violates the FDCPA by harming my reputation, but also potentially infringes upon the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by reporting inaccurate information. The reappearance of this removed debt suggests a failure to conduct proper investigations as required by the FCRA. Furthermore, I have no contract with this third-party agency, raising concerns about the legitimacy of their collection attempts. This situation may extend beyond mere regulatory violations into more serious territory. The coordinated effort to repeatedly report a removed debt could be indicative of a conspiracy to violate consumer protection laws. The attempt to collect on a debt with no legitimate claim, while damaging my credit report, may constitute a form of financial extortion. Additionally, the mishandling of my personal and financial information in this manner raises significant concerns about privacy violations and potential identity theft. I assert that these actions collectively represent a concerted effort to harass and coerce payment through improper means, causing undue harm to my financial standing and reputation. I demand an immediate investigation into these practices, the removal of this inaccurate information from my credit report, and cessation of all collection activities related to this alleged debt. I reserve the right to pursue all available legal remedies, including statutory damages under the FDCPA, actual damages for harm to my credit score and reputation, and any other applicable remedies under consumer protection and criminal laws.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Lockhart, Morris & Montgomery Inc.",SC,29203,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9774332

2024-08-10,Debt collection,I do not know,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Report Information dear cfpb I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate information on my credit report. Specifically, I am referring to a charge-off reported by MCA, which is over XXXX XXXX XXXX. This charge-off is significantly impacting my credit score and hindering my ability to secure housing. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as charge-offs should not be reported on a consumers credit report after 7 years from the date of first delinquency ( FCRA 605 ( a ) and ( b ) ) 1. The inclusion of this outdated charge-off is a violation of my rights under the FCRA. 

Furthermore, as a resident of XXXX XXXX, Washington, I am protected under the Washington Law Against Discrimination ( WLAD ) and the Fair Housing Act ( FHA ). These laws prohibit discrimination in housing based on disability and ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to housing opportunities23. The erroneous entry of this outdated charge-off on my credit report is hindering my fair chances of securing housing, which is a violation of these protections. 

This erroneous entry has detrimentally affected my credit score, dragging it below XXXX, and is severely limiting my opportunities to secure housing. As I am on a fixed income, receiving only XXXX, my ability to pay for housing is already constrained. The presence of this outdated charge-off further exacerbates my situation, making it nearly impossible to find fair housing. 

I kindly request that cfpb investigate this matter and remove the inaccurate charge-off from my credit report immediately. I do not remember owning any money to sound credit union and i was never contacted until recently by XXXX XXXX XXXX for owing any money until XXXX collection agency contacted me.below i have copy and pasted part of my credit report highlighting the disputed item, as well as a cease and desist request letter for XXXX as i felt their collection tactics were unethical and innapropriate.

2024-08-10,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX, with instructions and screencaps on how to set-up an auto-pay account with Alliance Bank ( see XXXX XXXX ). I cant recall the reason for the abrupt switch, but I honestly didnt care at the time. 

Approximately 5 years later, I received a certified mail with a demand letter from XXXX XXXX for fines and late fees totaling {$200.00}. I was completely dumbfounded, the main reason why I voluntarily signed up for auto-pay was to ensure that my assessments would be paid on time every month and late fees avoided. I had been receiving payment confirmation emails ( see XXXX  XXXX ) from Alliance Bank at the end of every month for approximately 5 years and there was nothing to indicate that anything was amiss. As a paperless household, I use auto-pay to help manage all of my bills. From my utilities to internet, I would basically set them all on auto-pay and be worry-free to focus on other things. Not once have I ever had a problem or issue with auto-pay until I started using Alliance Bank , solely at the behest of XXXX XXXX . We really didnt have a choice, if we wanted to use auto-pay, Alliance Bank was the only option available. 

According to XXXX XXXX, the late fees and subsequent fines were accrued whenever the HOA increased our monthly assessments and I failed to adjust my auto-pay accordingly to reflect the higher amount owed. They had explained that anytime the full amount is not received, its considered late and a fine would be assessed. I still didnt quite understand what the issue was since the balance for some of my other bills would fluctuate month-to-month and auto-pay has been working flawlessly for me. How is it possible to be setup on auto-pay and still accrue late fees at the same time? It was oxymoronic to me, so I decided to investigate and logged on to my account with Alliance to learn more. After the initial auto-pay setup that occurred 5 years earlier, I realized I had never logged back on because how often would anyone need to do that after setting up their auto-pay? After clicking on the XXXX link to the Alliance Bank web portal, I did not recognize the user interface and immediately needed a password reset to gain access to my account ( see XXXX  XXXX ). 

Once I was able to gain access, what I had discovered was really shocking and unlike any other auto-pay service I had ever used or witnessed ( XXXX  XXXX ). My first observation was the {$1.00} fee per ACH transaction, I have never been charged a fee to use auto-pay before. On top of that, this {$1.00} fee was never once mentioned nor disclosed in any of the screen caps from XXXX XXXX XXXX instructional email, nor do I recall ever being asked for my consent. 

Whats even more troubling was the verbiage right under the Fixed Amount box, a sentence and acknowledgement that I found to be highly unusual, impractical, and offensively intrusive to my financial privacy rights. It reads, You acknowledge and agree that your Association may update, however, is not required to updated your payment amount when a new assessment is assigned by the Association. As a grammatical sentence, its completely meaningless, incomprehensible, and misleading. Its only purpose was to inform the account holders that other people or the Association would have access and authority to change the auto-pay amount without their knowledge or consent. This is a completely outrageous, invasive, and patently ridiculous requirement of Alliance Bank for the use of its {$1.00} per payment auto-pay service. As the sole provider of the auto-pay service to homeowners at XXXX, Alliance Bank has a complete monopoly, courtesy of XXXX XXXX and potentially in violation of the United States antitrust laws. In exchange for this quid pro quo arrangement, Alliance Bank has given XXXX XXXX, veily disguised as the Association, unfettered access to its banking customers accounts without prior consent or proper authorization. 

Needless to say, I was livid and felt totally betrayed by Alliance Bank as a client and eventually decided to close my account. In an email exchange with XXXX XXXX, the HOA Support Specialist for Alliance Bank, about unauthorized access, he had indicated ( XXXX  XXXX ) that you logged youre your payment account on XX/XX/XXXX, but the ip address for that activity and specified date was inexplicably and conveniently omitted from their account log. Whereas my password reset request and activity back on XX/XX/XXXX, was logged with my home ip address, the activity back on XX/XX/XXXX was completed XXXX. I have requested proof of prior consent and even emailed associates of Alliance Bank many similar questions to XXXX XXXX. Their responses or a lack thereof, has been repetitive, evasive, and consistent all the way up to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX ). Please refer to your homeowners association appears to be the standing order and standard response for all Alliance Bank associates. The idea that our XXXX XXXX, a non-profit entity located in XXXX XXXX Texas, and its governing documents, would have direct impact, influence, and oversight of Alliance Bank operations is a concept beyond my limited comprehension. Does it also supersede federal banking laws, regulatory compliance, and jurisdiction of XXXX XXXX, Nevada? What does my HOA have to do with an ACH payment transaction conducted at a bank located approximately XXXX miles away in a different state and time zone? What happens if the Association used it XXXX  privileges to adjust the auto-pay amount to {$1000.00} on an account belonging to an XXXX  resident like my next-door neighbor, XXXX XXXX, who is XXXX XXXX XXXX and doesnt own a computer or tech savvy enough to uncover this gross invasion of privacy perpetrated by XXXX XXXX  in cooperation with Alliance Bank? How can we be certain that it hasnt happened already? 

When I later tried to log back on to my account, I learned that I had been placed on hold ( XXXX XXXX ). When I confronted Alliance Bank about my current status and reminded them of their complete monopoly over the auto-pay service for XXXX residents, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the HOA Operations Manager , said, You do have the option to mail a check or by using your financial institutions XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX ). 

Following XXXX XXXX advice, I inconveniently mailed my assessment check to Alliance Bank well in advance of the XX/XX/XXXX due date but nevertheless, I was still assessed a late fee by XXXX XXXX. Learning from my earlier mistake that trust must be earned and not given, I brought the check, stamped envelope, and visited the nearest USPS post office. I asked XXXX XXXX XXXX to mail, sign and bear witness ( XXXX  XXXX ) to the check and letter being sent. Nevertheless, the outcome was the exactly the same and my check didnt clear until well over a month later ( XXXX  XXXX ), providing XXXX XXXX with the perfect opportunity to assess another late fee and fine to my account. Its either an unbelievable coincidence or Alliance Bank was intentionally withholding my check as retaliation for my actions and demand of accountability from XXXX XXXX, an Alliance Bank business partner and co-conspirator against commerce, market competition, and fair trade. Its no wonder why Alliance Bank has earned such high praise and rave reviews from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX ). 

According to XXXX XXXX, Chief Operating Officer & Partner at XXXX XXXX XXXX, Alliance Association Bank does what they do better than anyone else because it is their true specialization. So, what exactly is it that Alliance Bank specializes in that gives it a competitive advantage over all of the other banks in Texas? Why would a property management company located in XXXX, Texas, force homeowners of the XXXX community located in XXXX XXXX, Texas, to send money and patronize a bank from the state of Nevada? Well, as it turns out, no other bank can intentionally manipulate the auto-pay option quite like Alliance Association Bank , a subsidiary of Western Alliance Bank , a reputable organization with a sterling reputation and well-established Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that all employees must agree to, as a condition for employment. 

When homeowners and/or consumers sign up for auto-pay, a vast majority of them use the Total New Balance option. Its not an insider secret and this option is practically synonymous with auto-pay. When you say auto-pay, it means paying the total balance or whatever amount is owed on a specific calendar day. No one signs up for auto-pay so he or she can periodically log back in to make adjustments, thats completely nonsensical and counter-intuitive to the whole concept of auto-pay. 

When you access the Alliance Bank portal to set-up a scheduled auto-pay, you will notice they only offer 2 convenient options for a fee of {$1.00} to XXXX homeowners. A one-time payment and a scheduled payment ( XXXX  XXXX ). The XXXX and most widely-used option of any auto-pay service has completely disappeared. Is this the illusion, magic trick, and specialization that XXXX XXXX was raving about? Well, spoiler alert, theres nothing special about deceptive business practices, thats why Texas has the Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the federal government has the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If you simply scroll down to the bottom of the page ( XXXX  XXXX ) and click on the Online Payment Terms and Conditions, on the 2nd page of their 12-page pdf file titled ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICE END USER TERMS AND CONDITIONS, you will learn that Total New Balance is the 3rd option of their Scheduled Payment Program ( XXXX  XXXX ). Its very important to read the fine prints, I would highly recommend that Alliance Association Bank start with their own. 

Not only is this unethical, Alliance Association Bank is an active participant in a fraudulent scheme and racket against its own paying customers. By intentionally removing the 3rd and most important scheduled payment option, Alliance is creating the ideal condition and confounding environment for busy individuals and unsuspecting homeowners to mess up so XXXX XXXX will have the opportunity to assess its infamous {$25.00} late fees. Its helping to generate an additional revenue stream for XXXX XXXX that may or may not go back to the coffers of the XXXX XXXX, a Texas non-profit entity. Last I checked, XXXX XXXX and Alliance Association Bank are not 501 ( c ) organizations. 

Its not a coincidence for XXXX XXXX to choose a bank in Nevada to open an account for an HOA with an estimated annual budget of {$4.00} XXXX. Alliance Association Bank is located outside the jurisdiction of Texas state laws, district court orders, and well beyond the reach of our community governing documents aka covenant. Alliance Association Bank works with property management companies like XXXX XXXX, not HOAs, its a very important distinction. Our web portal link to the bank is XXXX not XXXX, so there should be no doubt about who has control of the XXXX XXXX bank account at Alliance Association Bank. If I were a betting man, I would have my money on XXXX XXXX XXXX, our former property manager and current property director, a position they mustve created just for her. I would be very surprised if any of the board members actually have access to the bank account as required by the covenant. For these reasons and more, I thought it was only appropriate to file this formal complaint with the CFPB and I hope a referral to US Attorneys Office and/or FBI field office to investigate this matter further will soon follow.

Page 2 of 5 2 When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability ; common queries include, but are not limited to, the following ( i ) whether COINBASE did not take notice of any rule, law, or regulation, and/or possibly missed any material elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety ; ( ii ) whether by virtue of COINBASEs custodianship over my funds or by its control over them, they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so, whether that duty was breached ; ( iii ) whether COINBASE promoted the transaction ( s ) in question despite being aware of the nature of the transaction ( XXXX ) in question ( iv ) whether COINBASE was in compliance with its own policies and procedures ; ( v ) whether COINBASE owed duties to myself, what the scope of those duties was, and whether COINBASE did not uphold those duties ; ( vi ) whether COINBASEs conduct was unfair ; and ( XXXX ) whether COINBASE has XXXX its power the ability to, and should, compensate me for the harm that has befallen me. 
Upon identification of such unusual or suspicious activity, it is crucial that the relevant staff member adequately describe the factors making an activity or transaction suspicious, thoroughly depict the extent and nature of this activity and properly communicate to the customer that such activity meets the relevant criteria of fraud. 
In providing its services to a customer, a financial institution is required by law to exercise the care and skill of a diligent, prudent banker. In this case, this means that the payment service provider should not turn a blind eye to known facts pointing to a real possibility that their customer is being scammed. In other words, COINBASE must have had special knowledge of what was occurring or been alerted to a real possibility of fraud taking place. The financial institution must have known or reasonably ought to have known that I was dealing with a scammer. 
Granted, there is room for diversity of view insofar as reasonableness is concerned. Indeed, there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable person involves in its application a subjective element. 
However, it must be remembered that the correct test is always reasonable care in all circumstances, not average care. The fact that most people behave in a certain way may be good evidence that the conduct is reasonable, but this is not necessarily the case. Although reasonableness is a very fluid concept, all of the evidence suggests that COINBASE did not foresee the fraud and disregarded even the most obvious dangers in this respect.

2024-08-10,Checking or savings account,CD (Certificate of Deposit),Managing an account,Problem with renewal,"I opened a XXXX CD for {$XXXX} with Synchrony Bank XXXX XX/XX/year>, knowing that I would need the money at the end of the term. I did not realize and do not recall being informed that the XXXX  would be automatically renewed at the end of the term. Synchrony Bank automatically renewed the XXXX  at the end of the XXXX  months without my permission, and when I learned this after the fact and contacted them, they refused to end the new term and let me withdraw the money ( not including interest earned from the new term -- I am totally fine to forfeit that ). After finding that I couldn't do anything about it on their website, an online chat with customer service, and two phone calls with customer service in which I was given the runaround about unrelated issues, a manager told me on the phone that there was no way they could close the XXXX  without a mandatory penalty of 6 months interest -- or more than XXXX of the money I had earned from the first 14 month term. So my money is stuck with them for another 14 months or I have to pay $ XXXX in penalty. 

It is important to note that I live in XXXX on a XXXX XXXX XXXX as a civil servant ( I have been here XXXX years now ), which is one reason I received the notice that the XXXX  had been renewed so late and may have also contributed to problems I experienced when trying to use their website, though I have generally been able to use all other financial institutions ' websites with no problem here. 

Here are the other problems I experienced with Synchrony Bank : 1 ) I couldn't access their website to check on the account several months before it matured, even after calling technical support for help and spending a long time on the phone trying different things. 2 ) It wasn't clear to me when I established the XXXX  that it would automatically renew if I didn't take action. 3 ) Synchrony Bank sent me emails saying I had a message from them and wanted me to log on to their site to see what the message was instead of clearly informing me what was about to happen. This was after I had had problems with their website, and I didn't log on. 4 ) The only paper notice that I know I received arrived weeks after the XXXX  had already renewed and the 7 (? ) day "" grace period '' had already expired. I called within 24-48 hours of receiving the letter, and they would not let me close the account without a large penalty. As far as I can tell, I never received a paper notification beforehand saying the XXXX  would automatically renew. 5 ) Synchony still won't let me provide instructions now to automatically withdraw the money at the end of the new XXXX  term. They told me it is impossible to do that now and said I must call them within 45 days of the end of the new term to give them my instructions.

Taken together, this is absolutely unacceptable treatment. And when I called and offered a very reasonable solution ( offering them several more weeks to get the money back to me and letting them keep two months interest from the new term ), they did nothing to help resolve the problem and instead made me jump through hoops to even discuss the problems I was experiencing. I believe Synchrony is also using deceptive business practices.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9777316

My communication with XXXX XXXX began on XXXX and then was taken to text messaging via our cell phones ( I have copies of all online and text message conversations from XXXX and XXXX ). In XXXX XXXX XXXX did transport me to and from the procedure in XXXX, TN, waited, and brought me home after the procedure.

On that Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, I sent him a XXXX deposit, on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I sent him the remaining XXXX before or around XXXX XXXX. He confirmed he had sent both sums of money and Zelle confirmed that via emails ( I have those emails ). He then confirmed the time he would pick me up.

The package was picked up by XXXX on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, and was out for delivery Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXXXXXX XXXX The package was delivered at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX without any kind of signature confirmation required. I was at work all day, but I was aware that a delivery had happened. At about XXXX XXXX., an unknown person was let into the apartment building by a neighbor who was exiting for a smoke. This man went to the 5th floor via the elevator and then walked down to the 4th floor from the 5th floor, appearing to be scanning the area. for packages. He went down to the third floor, and then made his way to the second floor where I live and he located my package. On my XXXX  camera, as well as on multiple different high quality cameras that the building was kind enough to provide me with, he was caught on camera taking the package into the staircase between the second and first floor, opening the package and removing my items, and then disposing of the shipping box in the third floor trash room. He then left the building. I was not aware that a theft had occurred until I returned back home from work around XXXX XXXX that day. When I noticed that there was no package in front of my door nor in the lobby by the mailboxes, I immediately opened my XXXX  camera and looked to see if there was anything abnormal. I then found footage of the theft. I called the local police precinct to ask them what I should do and they informed me to call XXXX  and to file a police report with officers. I did so. After compiling the video footage from my own XXXX camera as well as from the building, alongside the official police report, I reached out to XXXX the same night as the theft. I spoke to somebody on the phone and explained the situation, and a claim was opened with XXXX  to investigate further steps. I was under the impression by the agent I spoke with that I would be protected by XXXX because I had not received my order and this was not my fault. I had even asked the representative what would happen if the claim was denied by XXXX  to which I was told, "" don't worry, XXXX will take care of you.. From then on, I was not too concerned. The next day, a detective from the XXXX visited my apartment while I was at work. We spoke over the phone since I was not there to answer the door for him. We discussed the events that happened and I provided him with all of the footage I received, which he then had added to my police report filing. I was informed that facial recognition is going to be run on the thief, since we had such high quality video including multiple full-face angles. I continued to not be too concerned because I was under the impression that I was protected financially for this loss by either the merchant, the payment processor or my credit card company. Later on that evening of Friday the XXXX, I received an email from XXXX informing me that the claim was rejected by XXXX due to the package showing as delivered and that XXXX was refusing to take responsibility for the stolen package. I was shocked to read this, so I reached out to PayPal where I made my purchase through knowing they had buyer protection. I explained the situation and was met with very similar verbiage that they will not be responsible for a package being stolen. I was baffled that their buyer protection policy, that specifically states if you did not receive your purchase, you will be protected and issued a refund. I was very shocked to hear that PayPal 's buyer protection did not have my back as they have advertised. I reached out to XXXX, who was the funding card for my split pay plan, and was met with the same answer. I called XXXX again and was told the same thing. I was told to continue working with law enforcement, which I am, however I am confused how buyer protection for not receiving your order does not apply to a theft that was very much not in ones control. I do not live in a single family home where someone can just walk up to a porch and walk away with a package, this thief trespassed on the property and I was not home or able to protect myself or the package from the theft. I am currently out exactly {$190.00}. The investigation is still ongoing with the XXXX for the theft, although I am less confident of a positive outcome, as I have seen the responses I received from the merchant, payment processor, and credit card company essentially blaming me for being robbed. What I am seeking is financial relief in the amount of my purchase price from some kind of consumer protection insurance clause that will protect me from this unforeseeable financial loss that was well beyond my reasonable control.",,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",NY,11435,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9795497

The harassing nature of your collection attempts is causing me undue stress and XXXX. 

It has come to my attention that the vehicle in question was repossessed and sold by your company. According to my understanding of the laws governing such situations, the proceeds from the sale of the repossessed vehicle should be used to offset the outstanding balance on the loan. Any remaining amount, known as the deficiency balance, is what the borrower is typically responsible for paying. 

I request that you provide me with a detailed breakdown of the sale of the vehicle, including the sale price, any associated fees, and the calculation of the remaining balance. I believe that the amount you are currently attempting to collect from me does not accurately reflect the deficiency balance after the sale of the vehicle. 

Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention that the constant communication and pressure from your company constitute harassment under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). I respectfully request that you cease all communication with me until this matter is resolved appropriately. 

Please provide me with the necessary documentation to support your claim for the full amount and an explanation for the discrepancy between the sale price of the vehicle and the amount you are attempting to collect from me.

They somehow opened a debit card, XXXX # XXXX. XXXX XXXX cvc XXXX. XXXX. ( I just received it in the mail ). I think the fraudulent transactions generated from that card.

2024-08-10,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"In XX/XX/year>, I ordered a table from XXXX XXXX that was advertised as ready to ship. After XXXX weeks with no shipment, I contacted XXXX XXXX, and they informed me that it would be several months before the table would be available. I decided to cancel my order and notified Affirm, through XXXX XXXX, about the cancellation. Affirm instructed me to wait for XXXX XXXX to process the refund. 

At the end of XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX confirming the cancellation and stating that I would be refunded within 10 business days. However, the refund did not arrive. I then opened a dispute on the XXXX XXXX app, but continued to receive non-payment notifications. When I called Affirm, they suggested opening a dispute but consistently failed to follow through. Despite my efforts to resolve the issue, including forwarding over 15 emails from XXXX XXXX, Affirm claimed they did not receive these emails and suggested I reach out to XXXX XXXX directly. 

Throughout this process, I was advised to continue making payments to avoid affecting my credit score. However, despite my clear communication that I wanted to resolve the issue and avoid credit damage, Affirm did not formally open a dispute. Consequently, they reported the issue to the credit bureaus, which severely impacted my credit score. 

This unresolved situation has placed an undue financial burden on me, hindering my ability to secure a mortgage at a reasonable rate. After exhausting all efforts to resolve the matter, I eventually paid the total amount. I have since filed a complaint with the Ohio Attorney Generals office, yet I have still not received a refund from either XXXX XXXX or Affirm, and the issue remains on my credit report.",,"Affirm Holdings, Inc",CA,93711,,Consent provided,Web,2024-08-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9793858
