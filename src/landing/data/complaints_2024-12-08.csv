2024-12-08,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"Subject : Discrimination Based on Immigration Status in KeyBanks Checking Account Promotion I am writing to file a complaint regarding KeyBanks discriminatory practices related to their {$300.00} checking account bonus promotion. I believe this policy unjustly excludes XXXX XXXX holders ( XXXX XXXX ) and violates protections against discrimination based on immigration status or national origin. 

Details of the Incident : On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to open a checking account online to qualify for KeyBanks {$300.00} bonus promotion. During the process, I was informed that online applications were restricted to U.S. citizens only and that, as a XXXX XXXX holder, I would need to apply in person at a branch. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I visited the KeyBank branch located at : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, WA XXXX. 

A banker began opening the account for me. However, during the process, the banker needed to call for confirmation regarding the bonus eligibility. After the call, the banker informed me that the bonus could not be applied in person and confirmed that the promotion was effectively limited to U.S. citizens because online applications for XXXX XXXX holders were not allowed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX customer service for further clarification. The representative again confirmed that the {$300.00} bonus was available only to U.S. citizens since XXXX XXXX holders could not apply online, and the bonus could not be applied in-branch. 

Basis for Complaint : This practice by KeyBank appears to discriminate against XXXX XXXX holders, violating protections under federal laws such as : 1. Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) Prohibits discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status in financial services.

2. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of XXXX Prohibits discrimination based on national origin by institutions receiving federal financial assistance. 
3. UDAAP Regulations ( Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices ) Enforced by the CFPB to ensure fair treatment of consumers. 

As a lawful permanent resident, I meet all the standard eligibility requirements for the checking account and promotion. Excluding me solely based on immigration status is unfair and discriminatory. 


Washington state also has strong protections against discrimination that apply in this situation, in addition to federal laws. 

XXXX. Washington Law Against Discrimination ( WLAD ) RCW 49.60 Scope : WLAD prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, including financial services and banking, based on race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, among other protected classes.

Application : Banks are considered places of public accommodation, and denying a promotion to XXXX XXXX holders while offering it to U.S. citizens could violate WLAD. 
Enforcement : The Washington State Human Rights Commission ( WSHRC ) enforces this law.

2. Consumer Protection Act ( CPA ) RCW 19.86 Scope : Protects against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in trade and commerce, including banking services.

Application : Excluding XXXX XXXX holders from an advertised promotion could be seen as an unfair practice under this law. 

XXXX. XXXX Municipal Code ( SMC ) Chapter 14.06 Scope : The City of XXXX prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on national origin, citizenship, or immigration status. 
Enforcement : The XXXX Office for Civil Rights ( XXXX ) handles related discrimination within the city. 


Requested Action : I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and ensure that XXXX promotional offers are applied fairly and without discrimination based on immigration status or national origin. Furthermore, I ask that KeyBank be required to extend the {$300.00} bonus offer to eligible XXXX XXXX holders who meet all other conditions.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Dear CFPB, I am filing this complaint regarding serious inaccuracies in the reporting of my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) ** by Experian and XXXX XXXX Specifically, this account falsely reflects late payments in XXXX and XXXX of last year, along with inconsistencies in the reporting details across both credit bureaus. I have taken screenshots documenting these discrepancies as evidence. 

The reporting practices of XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus violate several provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and related U.S. laws. I demand immediate action to address and rectify these violations. 

Violations of Federal Law 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports Credit reporting agencies are required to maintain and report accurate consumer information. The blatant inconsistencies and inaccuracies in this case demonstrate a failure to uphold this obligation, resulting in harm to my creditworthiness.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) Dispute Resolution Obligations Upon disputing inaccuracies, credit bureaus must conduct a timely and reasonable investigation. Past attempts to resolve this matter have been ignored or mishandled, failing to meet legal standards for a proper investigation. 

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Furnisher Responsibility to Report Accurate Information XXXX XXXX XXXX as a furnisher of information, is prohibited from reporting information it knows or should reasonably know to be inaccurate. False late payments violate this provision. 

15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) Obsolete Information The inclusion of unverifiable or false late payments contravenes the mandate to exclude inaccurate or outdated information. 

15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) Permissible Purposes for Reporting Consumer Information Reporting entities must comply with permissible purposes and ensure consumer data is not misrepresented or mishandled. XXXX XXXX false and conflicting data breaches this obligation. 

Impact of Violations The inaccurate late payments have adversely affected my credit score, jeopardizing my ability to obtain credit on fair terms. This financial and emotional harm is a direct result of negligent and unlawful reporting practices. The FCRA provides consumers with protection against such actions, yet XXXX XXXX, Experian, and XXXX have collectively failed to comply. 

My Requests Immediate Removal of Late Payments : Remove the false late payments reported for XXXX and XXXX of last year from my credit reports. 
Corrections Across All Bureaus : Ensure that my account is accurately reflected across all reporting agencies.

Full Investigation : Conduct a thorough investigation into XXXX XXXX reporting practices and ensure compliance with FCRA standards. 
Written Confirmation : Provide written confirmation of receipt of this dispute and resolution updates. 
Evidence Provided I have attached screenshots of the inconsistent and inaccurate reporting for your review. 

I urge the CFPB to address this matter promptly. The continued disregard for federal law by XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus demands immediate accountability. I trust that the CFPB will ensure my rights under the FCRA and related statutes are protected.

XXXX XXXX Subject : Urgent Demand for Removal of Unauthorized Accounts and Violations of Federal Law XXXX  has demonstrated a clear failure to maintain consistency and transparency in its handling of your dispute, further compounding the harm caused by its already unlawful practices. On one hand, XXXX sent written correspondence stating that your disputes were deemed frivolous because they were previously verified or lacked new relevant information. Yet, when you called XXXX representatives, they contradicted this claim by asserting that the FTC report you submitted, along with other supporting documents, was invalid or not reflected in their system. This blatant inconsistency in communication highlights systemic negligence, internal disorganization, and possibly intentional efforts to delay or obstruct dispute resolution. 

Key Issues with XXXX Contradictions 1. Misleading Written Statements : The letter implied that your disputes were frivolous, suggesting there was no new information to warrant further investigation. However, the supporting documentation you submitted, including proof of identification, proof of address, and the FTC Identity Theft Report, satisfies the requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 for blocking disputed items. 
2. Disregard of Submitted Documents : XXXX  claim during your phone call that the FTC report was invalid reflects either a failure to properly process submitted documents or intentional misrepresentation of its obligations under federal law. 
3. Obstruction of Consumer Rights : The conflicting statements prevent you from effectively resolving the dispute and exercising your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). By sending contradictory information, XXXX undermines its obligation to provide a clear and efficient dispute resolution process. 
4. Possible Profit-Driven Motives : The delays caused by these contradictory statements may be a tactic to continue profiting from unauthorized or inaccurate information on your credit report, as credit reporting agencies often benefit financially from retaining more data on consumers. 
5. Violation of FCRA Procedures : According to 15 U.S.C. 1681i, XXXX must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information and can not arbitrarily declare disputes frivolous, especially when documentation is provided. 

Legal and Regulatory Implications 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : XXXX must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information on your credit report. Failing to process valid disputes and providing contradictory information violates this mandate. 
15 U.S.C. 1681n : Willful noncompliance with the FCRA exposes XXXX to statutory, actual, and punitive damages. 
Section 5 ( a ) of the FTC Act : Misleading consumers through contradictory communication may constitute unfair and deceptive practices, subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 
Consumer Financial Protection Act ( 12 U.S.C. 5536 ) : XXXX actions may violate the prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ). 

Demand for Accountability XXXX  inability to provide consistent and accurate information underscores a broader systemic failure within its dispute resolution processes. I will not tolerate the continued violation of my rights. Your contradictory communications must be resolved, and the following actions must be taken immediately : 1. Remove all unauthorized accounts and information in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2.

2. Provide a written explanation reconciling the discrepancies between your written and verbal statements.

3. Implement internal compliance measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future. 





To Whom It May Concern, This formal complaint demands the immediate removal of unauthorized accounts and inaccurate information from my consumer report. Despite my compliance with all legal requirements under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( Section 605C2 ), these accounts remain unlawfully reported. Furthermore, I have IRS-confirmed evidence of Form 1099-C cancellation for the debts associated with these accounts, proving they are no longer valid or collectible. 
The fact that these canceled accounts remain on my report, despite their resolution with the IRS, demonstrates not only your noncompliance with federal law but also a potential fraudulent financial intent. If these items are not promptly removed, I reserve the right to report your continued actions to the IRS under their whistleblower program, as the profit gained from unauthorized reporting constitutes tax fraud and abuse. 
Accounts to Be Removed Immediately : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Violations of Federal Law and Additional Actions : 1. FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 : All disputed information must be blocked within four ( 4 ) business days upon submission of proper documentation. Despite fulfilling all requirements, including FTC Identity Theft Report, identification, and proof of address, these accounts remain unblocked.

2. IRS Reporting Requirements : The debts associated with the accounts above have been canceled via Form 1099-C and accepted by the IRS. Continuing to report these accounts as valid debts constitutes a misrepresentation of their status. Additionally, this behavior indicates potential violations of tax laws if these debts are used for financial gain or inaccurate reporting purposes.

3. Fraudulent Intent and Misrepresentation : By retaining and profiting from inaccurate and unauthorized information, your actions may violate 18 U.S.C. 1962 ( RICO ) and 18 U.S.C. 894 ( Extortionate Credit Practices ).

4. Whistleblower and Audit Risk : If this noncompliance persists, I will report your activities to the IRS for further investigation and audit. The whistleblower program rewards accurate reporting of tax fraud and abuse, which includes the exploitation of consumer data for monetary gain.

5. Breach of Consumer Rights : Your failure to remove canceled debts constitutes ongoing harm to my financial reputation, with severe consequences for your compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681b and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act protections. 
Immediate Demands : 1. Immediate Removal of All Accounts Listed : All canceled debts and unauthorized accounts must be removed from my credit report within seven ( 7 ) business days of receiving this notice. 
2. Written Confirmation of Compliance : Provide written confirmation that these accounts have been permanently removed and will not be re-reported. 
3. IRS Whistleblower Avoidance : Take corrective action immediately to avoid being reported for fraudulent financial practices and unauthorized profit from canceled debts. 
Conclusion : XXXX, Experian, and XXXX continued failure to comply with federal law is a direct attack on my financial stability and consumer rights. I have met all requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, and the additional inclusion of 1099-C evidence further cements that these accounts have no basis for continued reporting. 
This is your final opportunity to resolve this matter. Failure to comply will result in further escalations, including filing whistleblower complaints with the IRS and pursuing legal remedies for damages under the FCRA, CFPB regulations, and RICO statutes.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,33993,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11071659

No chat agent ever responded and over {$200.00} was debited. I had to borrow money from my children to avoid becoming overdrawn. I attempted again today to turn off autopay so I can manually make upcoming payments. 

I was told Sezzle could not do that, only I could do reschedules ( not what I asked ) through the app. This is a violation of the law.

Despite my efforts to resolve this issue directly with both the merchant and Bank of America, the matter remains unresolved. The details of my complaint are as follows : Disputed Amount : {$8800.00} Merchant : XXXX XXXX XXXX Date of Dispute Initiation : XX/XX/year> I have been a loyal Bank of America customer for 17 years and have consistently maintained an excellent payment history. However, when I encountered an issue with an unresponsive merchant, Bank of America failed to protect my interests and uphold its commitment to its customers. 

Details of the Dispute : I was charged {$8800.00} by the merchant for services/products that were not provided as agreed. Despite multiple attempts to contact the merchant, I have received no response or resolution. I subsequently raised this issue with Bank of America, expecting their support in this dispute. Unfortunately, Bank of America 's response has been inadequate, and the matter remains unresolved. 

I am seeking the CFPB 's assistance in ensuring that Bank of America fulfills its obligation to protect its customers and resolves this dispute promptly. Attached to this letter are copies of relevant documents, including my credit card statements, correspondence with the merchant and Bank of America, and any other supporting materials. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in resolving this issue.

While reviewing my loan disclosure and the TILA I noticed that mortgage loan was miscalculated and the amount financed should have been {$280000.00} but I was financed at {$280000.00}. I also noticed various other TILA violations that I brought to their attention such as escrow payments and appraisal value being inflated and the appraisal is invalid because I was told I would get an in person appraisal but it was performed virtually. I was not given 3 days to review my closing disclosure so I was unable to catch the errors. I recieved my closing documents on XXXX and I closed on XXXX. I even questioned walking away from the loan on closing day because they miscalculated closing cost and asked me to go get some additional funds, and when I called my mortgage broker I was misinformed and I was never told that I had the right to rescind. The seller paid the additional funds on my behalf and that amount is also not documented. I still closed on the XXXX and I was not give the 3 days prior to closing and I was not given an additional 3 days after changes had to be made to the funding or cost to close. 

I sent an letter to the escalalations department on XX/XX/year> and I have not heard from them. I have a forbearance that ended on the XXXX and I tried to wait to hear from the escalation department about the corrections but after I did not hear from them I turned in my modification application. As of today I still have not heard from either department. 

This does not outline all the errors but I have attached the letter that was sent to the escalations department along with a copy of the closing disclosure.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION,AL,35215,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11071215

The violations are as follows : FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : You are reporting fraudulent accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me, thus infringing upon my privacy rights. I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. I insist that my hard inquiries and account information not be shared on my credit report. 
FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : The information you are reporting falsely suggests that I applied for multiple inquiries and accounts, when in reality, these were the result of a scammer 's actions. Such false reporting misleads future creditors. By reporting these unverified items, you violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and fail to comply with its fairness requirements.

FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : You accepted credit information about me without verifying its accuracy firsthand. This willful noncompliance is punishable by civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation.

FCRA Section 605B - Aggravated Identity Theft : You shared my personal information with numerous creditors without obtaining my consent, making you criminally liable for aggravated identity theft, which carries a penalty of up to 2 years of imprisonment.

Violation of Identity Theft Laws : Creditors obtained my information without my true consent and used it to obtain credit from other financial institutions, constituting identity theft.

I made the XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX ; which was reversed by XXXX due to they didn't have the packet yet from XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent the payment back through. I made XX/XX/XXXX, payment, then on XX/XX/XXXX I called in to schedule XXXX with XXXX, conf # XXXX which XXXX said they never recieved, because I was told the payment was deferred and was charged {$2000.00}. I received documentation concerning the homestead exemption ; my taxes went down to {$60.00} a year. I spoke with XXXX and was given the email address to send, which was received by email on XX/XX/XXXX per email from XXXX. I called XXXX to see when the analysis would be made, and I was told on XX/XX/XXXX, I asked about the refund of the escrow because of the taxes being lowered and was told no, there's no refund. I was told account was going into foreclosure, and that I could do a modification to save my home. Which was done on XX/XX/XXXX, before then I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1900.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX about another VA Refinance and was told that I qualified and was given an account number, I called her several times for the status, no returned phone call. When I called again I was told that I was in a forebearance and that I couldn't refinance. The forebearance was for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX with no payment. I then found out that the loan was transferred on XX/XX/XXXX to Carrington Mortgage. I called Carrington to see what was going on and was told I had to wait for 60 days for them to receive the packet and run an analysis, and it would be done on XX/XX/XXXX and to make sure I made my payment and I did. No analyis was ran. When I spoke with XXXX I was told it would be done on XXXX, then XXXX said that it would be XXXX or XXXX, and that the forebearance was reenstated till XX/XX/XXXX, I also asked why my payment went up I was told due to the shortage in the Escrow. I tried to call the Customer Care and was told that I was in collections byXXXX, and that I can't talk to Customer Care because the calls would only come back to collections.

I'm still reeling from XXXX XXXX and they are holding the checks from the insurance company, I need to pay contractors. I was told it takes 48 hours to upload, another 10 business days to review, and call me with the specifics. I overnighted the checks back because I had forgotten to sign.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Subject : Complaint Against XXXX XXXX XXXX Compliance Department Regarding Improper Use of My Credit File To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX for violations of federal statutes related to the improper use of my credit file, reporting of information without consent, and failure to comply with legal obligations regarding debt reporting and income recognition. 

1. Unauthorized Use and Reporting of Credit Information : XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which specifies permissible purposes for obtaining and using consumer credit reports. I never provided written consent for XXXX XXXX XXXX to report any information to my credit file. According to 16 CFR 313.7, financial institutions must obtain explicit authorization from consumers before sharing nonpublic personal information unless an exception applies, none of which are applicable here.

Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to do. Their actions also appear to violate 15 U.S.C. 6805, which empowers regulatory bodies to enforce these provisions.

2. Charge-Off Reporting and Misclassification : A charge-off is a bookkeeping designation used by creditors for tax purposes when they consider a debt uncollectible. Under federal tax law, a charge-off can be treated as a cancellation of debt, which may constitute income to the debtor. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX did not issue a XXXX ( Cancellation of Debt ) form to me, as required under IRS regulations XXXX to substantiate that the debt was canceled and classified as income. Without this form, their reporting of the charge-off to credit reporting agencies is not only improper but also misleading. 

Moreover, a charge-off does not represent a valid certificate of indebtedness. A certificate of indebtedness reflects a binding obligation that is enforceable ; a charge-off, by its nature, implies that the debt has been resolved or abandoned by the creditor. Reporting a charge-off to credit bureaus under these circumstances constitutes inaccurate reporting. 

XXXX. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : XXXX XXXX XXXX has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 68026805 ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ). 

Additionally, I request clarification and appropriate remediation regarding : 1.The absence of a XXXX form to substantiate the charge-off as canceled debt. 
2.The improper classification of a charge-off as a certificate of indebtedness.

3.The unauthorized reporting of information to credit bureaus without my explicit written consent. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in ensuring compliance and protecting my rights as a consumer.

'' This reinsertion violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and raises concerns regarding compliance with federal law.

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 1. Failure to Provide a Certificate of Accuracy ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ) Experian has
reinserted the account information for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX without providing the required certification of accuracy. According to FCRA guidelines, a certification must be provided to validate the accuracy of information before it can be reinserted into a consumer report. I demand that Experian immediately provide this certificate or remove the account from my report.

2. Identification of the Account as Other Account and Lack of Furnisher Agreement ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 5 ) ) The account is labeled as other account on my report, which misrepresents the nature of the debt. Furthermore, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a recognized furnisher with an agreement to report such information to credit bureaus. Courts do not report such accounts to consumer reporting agencies. This inaccurate reporting violates your duty to maintain the maximum possible accuracy of consumer reports.

Violations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) 1. Improper Sharing of Personal Information ( 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( c ) and 6802 ( d ) ) Experian and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX appear to have violated the GLBA by sharing my personal information with third-party institutions without proper authorization. I demand that you provide evidence of my consent to such sharing, as required by law, or immediately cease and rectify this unlawful practice.

Demands To resolve this matter, I demand the following actions : 1. Immediate deletion of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account from my credit report.

2. A full investigation and validation of the information, including the certificate of accuracy, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ).

3. Evidence of any furnisher agreements allowing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to report such information.

4. Confirmation that my personal information is not being shared with unauthorized third parties, in compliance with the GLBA.

5. Deletion of personal addresses I have never resided at : "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX MI XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX MI XXXX '' If Experian fails to address these violations promptly, I am prepared to escalate this matter by filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my state attorney generals office.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter within 30 days and confirm the specific actions taken to resolve this dispute. You may contact me in writing at the address provided above.

Experian is in clear violations of the above mentioned. I have uploaded proof of my dispute. I sent my dispute over 30 days ago. United States Postal Service tracking number is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Dear CFPB Representative, I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against Experian for its willful noncompliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and to demand immediate action pursuant to my rights under federal law. 

Background The following account appear on my credit report as negative items XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Account Number : XXXX This record have been deleted from the record of the original data furnisher, XXXX XXXX This was confirmed by a direct inquiry with XXXX, which no longer maintains these records. 

Legal Basis for Dispute 1. Inaccuracy of Reported Information Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information they report. Because the source of this information, XXXX, no longer maintains these records, Experian is reporting inaccurate and incomplete information by continuing to include these items on my credit report. 

2. Obligation to Remove Information FCRA 605 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) requires the removal of inaccurate items from the credit report within 4 days of a dispute being submitted. Given that these records are demonstrably inaccurate, Experian 's failure to promptly remove them violates this statutory obligation.

3. Willful Noncompliance Under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, Experian is liable for willful noncompliance with the FCRA. This includes failing to conduct a reasonable investigation into the accuracy of the disputed items and failing to act in accordance with the law to ensure only verified and accurate information remains on my credit report. 

Demand for Resolution I demand that the following actions be taken immediately : The removal of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) from my Experian credit report within the time frame required by FCRA 605 ( b ).

Confirmation from Experian that these items have been removed, along with a revised copy of my credit report reflecting these changes.

Request for CFPB Action I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly to ensure Experian complies with its legal obligations under the FCRA. This is a clear case of willful noncompliance, and I expect immediate corrective action. 

Enclosed are copies of supporting documents, including correspondence with XXXX confirming the deletion of these records and my dispute history with Experian.

I have been given extensions, and have been charged late payments even if I pay earlier in the month. 

I have been told that 11 payments were extended. I have asked for the extension paperwork which I have not received. Extensions were explained to me that they go on the back of the loan which extends the length of time that I pay for the car. 

My issue is that the balance owed is incorrect, which makes it look as if I am not paying for the car. When I looked at my XXXX credit report it states incorrectly that I have only made one payment, since XXXX, which is not correct and the car would have been repossessed. I need this corrected on my credit reports to reflect that I have been making payments which should decrease the balance. 

I am being contacted constantly by the company, but have not been able to speak to anyone higher than customer service to get this corrected.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To : Experian, XXXX and XXXX I am writing to formally address the ongoing inaccuracies and reporting violations on my credit reports. Despite my previous attempts to resolve these issues, the inaccurate information remains, and the credit bureaus have failed to respond appropriately. The continued inaction and false reporting of my personal information are direct violations of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other applicable federal and state laws. 

Accounts to be Corrected : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) The inaccurate information reported by XXXX on my credit report, including incorrect account status, balances, or any other erroneous reporting, must be corrected. If this account has been reported as open or active while it is closed, or if there are any discrepancies with the dates and balance reported, this must be corrected immediately. 

XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX  has reported inaccurate information on my credit file. This includes any incorrect account status or outstanding balances that do not reflect the actual state of the account. The account status, dates, and balances reported by XXXX XXXX  must be verified and corrected immediately. 

Unauthorized Hard Inquiries Additionally, I have noticed multiple unauthorized hard inquiries that were made to my credit report without my consent. According to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( c ), no one may obtain a credit report or perform a hard inquiry without my written consent. These inquiries need to be removed immediately as they were made in violation of my rights under the FCRA.

Legal Violations : Failure to Correct Inaccurate Information - 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( e ) : Under 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( e ), you are required to investigate and correct any inaccuracies in my credit report upon receiving a dispute. Despite my prior notifications, the inaccuracies remain uncorrected, violating this provision. 
Failure to Provide Results of Investigation - 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( i ) : 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( i ) mandates that you conduct a reasonable investigation upon receiving notice of a dispute and provide the results of that investigation. The continued reporting of false information after I have disputed it is a violation of this statute. 
Violation of Consumer Protection Laws- HJR 192, XXXX, XXXX & XXXX : The XXXX XXXX XXXX resolution and the 1099C and 1099A guidelines require that if a debt is written off or canceled, it must be reported as such, and a 1099-C form should be issued. I have never received such documentation, and the reporting of this debt as active is a clear violation of these rules. 

Failure to Remove Inaccurate Information - FCRA Section 611 ( XXXX ) and FCRA Section 605 ( c ) : FCRA Section 611 ( XXXX ) requires the removal of inaccurate or unverifiable information upon investigation. Furthermore, FCRA Section 605 ( c ) restricts the reporting of certain negative information beyond a specific timeframe, and your continued reporting of this account is in violation of this limitation. 

Right to Rescind Credit Transactions- 15 U.S. Code 1635 : According to 15 U.S. Code 1635, I have the right to rescind credit transactions under specific circumstances. The continued erroneous reporting of my credit history disregards this right, particularly regarding debts that may be canceled or rescinded.

Debt Collection Violations- 15 U.S. Code 1692 : Under 15 U.S. Code 1692, debt collectors are prohibited from reporting false or misleading information to credit reporting agencies. The account being reported on my credit file is inaccurate, and there has been no action taken to rectify this violation.

Errors in Credit Report : I find that the following information provided on my credit report is an error. This account was never late or owed any amount ( pursuant to XXXX XXXX XXXX ). You are alleging that I owe a debt without furnishing any proof of this debt, including a full accounting ledger or proof of any 1099s that were filed on behalf of my principal. You have failed to demonstrate that you have followed all relevant laws and regulations for reporting this debt. 

Therefore, you must remove this account from my credit report immediately. 

It is against the law to report any information that has not been proven accurate. Under Georgia law, including provisions found in Georgia Code Title 7 - Banking and Finance, and under relevant statutes such as Georgias Fair Business Practices Act ( FBPA ), a deficiency claim can not be asserted unless all required notices were properly and timely given, and all allowable redemption and cure time limits were adhered to. 

Additionally, as outlined in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are required to adhere to the following provisions : 15 U.S.C. 1692a ( 1-7 ) : Definitions and regulations governing what constitutes fair and unfair practices in debt collection.

15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 1-12 ) : Prohibits false or misleading representations in connection with debt collection.

15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a-c ) : Requires validation of debts upon request, including the provision of evidence supporting any alleged debt.

15 U.S.C. 1666 : Governs billing errors and prohibits creditors from imposing unauthorized fees.

15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) : Requires accurate reporting of information and protection of consumer privacy. 

Supreme Court Cases : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : The U.S. Supreme Court in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX emphasized that a consumer reporting agency must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information it provides to others. If the information being reported is inaccurate, the consumer has the right to dispute and seek correction. This case reinforces my right to challenge and have corrected any inaccuracies that are being reported about my credit file. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : In XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Supreme Court held that a consumer must demonstrate a concrete injury in order to bring a claim under the FCRA. The Court made it clear that when a consumer 's personal information is misused, especially in ways that can harm their financial reputation, they are entitled to seek legal remedies. The inaccurate reporting and unauthorized hard inquiries on my credit report have caused harm, and I am entitled to seek remedies under these precedents. 

Consequences of Non-Compliance : The alleged claim of a deficiency is null and void, and any continued collection activities or reporting of this invalid claim on my credit reports will be considered a violation of the FDCPA and FCRA.

If you fail to comply with the above requests, I reserve all rights to seek damages against all parties involved under applicable state, federal, and Georgia-specific remedies. 

Legal Demand : Under the FCRA and Georgia law, you are required by law to ensure the accuracy of all information reported. The continued failure to correct these inaccuracies despite repeated notifications is a direct violation of federal consumer protection laws. 

In addition to correcting the inaccuracies, I am entitled to damages under the FCRA, including actual damages, punitive damages up to {$1000.00}, and attorney fees. Moreover, I am entitled to damages for mental anguish in the amount of {$10000.00} due to the ongoing distress caused by the inaccurate reporting and the misuse of my personal information. 

Total Damages : Actual Damages : To be determined based on the impact this has had on my financial health. 

Punitive Damages : Up to {$1000.00} under the FCRA. 
Attorney Fees : To be determined. 
Mental Anguish : {$10000.00} each for emotional distress caused by the continued reporting of inaccurate information, unauthorized use of my data, and the failure to correct these errors. 

Risk of Further Legal Claims : As a data furnishing company involved in the buying, selling, transferring, and securitizing accounts and personal information, you are privately profiting off my personal information. This practice not only increases the risk of data breaches but also raises concerns about identity theft. 

These activities expose you to the potential for legal claims due to mishandling consumer data and may place you at significant risk for further legal consequences. I want to make it clear that continuing these practices could expose you to claims related to past data breaches, identity theft, and violations of consumer protection laws.

If this situation is not resolved promptly, you may face additional claims for damages resulting from these violations.

Corrective Action Required : Immediate Removal of the inaccurate information from my credit reports, including the incorrect account status, dates, and balances on all three credit bureaus.

Verification of Debt : Provide proof that the reported debt is accurate, and if it is a written-off account, issue a 1099-C form as required.

Investigation Results : Provide written confirmation that a reasonable investigation has been conducted, and include the results of the investigation and any corrective actions taken.

Removal of Unauthorized Hard Inquiries : All unauthorized hard inquiries on my credit report must be immediately removed, as they were made without my written consent.

Deadline for Resolution : Please correct these errors and provide the requested documentation within 7 days of receipt of this letter. Failure to comply will leave me no choice but to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursue legal action to seek damages under the FCRA, Georgia law, and other applicable state and federal laws. 

Conclusion : The continued reporting of these inaccuracies, failure to respond to my disputes, and the false reporting of my personal information have caused significant harm. I expect these issues to be addressed immediately, and I look forward to your prompt resolution of this matter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30047,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11075176

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/year> Subject : Complaint Against XXXX XXXX XXXX Regarding Improper Use of My Credit File To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX for violations of federal statutes related to the improper use of my credit file, reporting of information without consent, and failure to comply with legal obligations regarding debt reporting and income recognition. 
1. Unauthorized Use and Reporting of Credit Information : XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which specifies permissible purposes for obtaining and using consumer credit reports. I never provided written consent for XXXX XXXX XXXX to report any information to my credit file. 
According to 16 CFR 313.7, financial institutions must obtain explicit authorization from consumers before sharing nonpublic personal information unless an exception applies, none of which are applicable here. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX failed to do. Their actions also appear to violate 15 U.S.C. 6805, which empowers regulatory bodies to enforce these provisions.

2. Charge-Off Reporting and Misclassification : A charge-off is a bookkeeping designation used by creditors for tax purposes when they consider a debt uncollectible. Under federal tax law, a charge-off can be treated as a cancellation of debt, which may constitute income to the debtor. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX did not issue a 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) form to me, as required under IRS regulations , to substantiate that the debt was canceled and classified as income. Without this form, their reporting of the charge-off to credit reporting agencies is not only improper but also misleading. 

Moreover, a charge-off does not represent a valid certificate of indebtedness. A certificate of indebtedness reflects a binding obligation that is enforceable ; a charge-off, by its nature, implies that the debt has been resolved or abandoned by the creditor. Reporting a charge-off to credit bureaus under these circumstances constitutes inaccurate reporting.

3. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : XXXX XXXX XXXX has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. XXXX ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ). Additionally, I request clarification and appropriate remediation regarding : 1. The absence of a 1099-C form to substantiate the charge-off as canceled debt.

2. The improper classification of a charge-off as a certificate of indebtedness.

3. The unauthorized reporting of information to credit bureaus without my explicit written consent. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in ensuring compliance and protecting my rights as a consumer.

The accounts in question are : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX ( Experian, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  Account Number : XXXX ( Experian, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX ( Experian, XXXX ) Violations of Federal Law The reporting by these entities violates several provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and related laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports Credit reporting agencies are legally obligated to ensure that consumer information is accurate. These accounts reflect false late payments and inconsistent data, demonstrating a clear failure to comply.

Pursuant to 15 USC 1681e ( b ) please complete this inaccurate account or delete it from my consumer reports.

The Law Cleary States : ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation required ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

I DO NOT consent to any E-OSCAR verification as this method is not reliable or lawful, according to the standards set for by the FCRA.

I am requesting that you validate the following items non-electronically, by performing a reasonable and FAIR re-investigation : Please provide the following details of the methods by which you verified these accounts : a. Identity and position of the representative contacted?

b. Date, duration, and substance of the conversation?

c. Contact details utilized?

( b ) Civil liability for knowing noncompliance Any person who obtains a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose shall be liable to the consumer reporting agency for actual damages sustained by the consumer reporting agency or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater. 

These are now multiple attempts to handle this matter privately. If these accounts keep getting verified by a faulty e-Oscar system when I know these accounts are erroneous and destroying my credit worthiness, I will in fact sue your agency for the maximum monetary damages that the FCRA allows. 

Your agency has less than 30 days to respond with a fair reasonable re-investigation or I will have no choice but to seek legal action.

Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation of Disputed Information : On XX/XX/year>, I filed a dispute with XXXX regarding inaccuracies in my credit report. I explicitly requested a manual review of the disputed information due to its complexity. I provided clear supporting evidence, including highlighted copies of my credit report identifying the errors. However, Experian used the E-Oscar system to process my dispute electronically rather than conducting the manual review I requested. This process fails to ensure a thorough investigation, as required under the FCRA. 
The response I received was vague and did not provide sufficient detail regarding the methods, sources, or procedures used to verify the disputed information. My specific questions about the investigation process remain unanswered. 
2. Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance by a Collection Agency : Account Name Account Number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Despite my dispute, Experian, XXXX, and XXXX continue to report this collection account without verifying its validity or requiring the collection agency to issue a 1099-C. This raises questions about the legitimacy of the debt and violates federal regulations.

Key Violations : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : o Experian violated 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) by failing to conduct a manual review of my dispute as explicitly requested.

o The use of E-Oscar resulted in an inadequate and incomplete investigation.

2. Failure to Provide Details of Investigation : o Experian failed to provide the methods, sources, and documentation used in their investigation, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 4 ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ).

3. Inaccurate Reporting and Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance : o Experian, XXXX, and XXXX continue to report inaccurate information, violating my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

o The collection agencys failure to issue a 1099-C for canceled or forgiven debt violates IRS regulations and raises concerns about the accounts validity.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30134,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11072974

Complaint Summary : I am submitting this complaint against EXPERIAN regarding the inaccurate information reported in my credit report, which violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
On XXXX XXXX of Credit Report, I discovered discrepancies in the following account ( s ) : Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Disputed Information : Inaccuracies, account number is reported as incomplete, high balance is reported differently in the credit agencies, date of last activity, last payment, and credit. 

Under Section 611 of the FCRA, I have the right to dispute inaccuracies and request prompt investigation. I formally requested a reinvestigation of the account information and cited relevant sections of the FCRA, including : 1. Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Requirement for verification of accounts through original documentation.

2. Section 611 : Right to dispute inaccuracies and request investigation.

3. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) : Removal of unverifiable information dont validated for creditor Original.

4. 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires that the procedures for including information in credit reports ensure maximum possible accuracy Despite my request, EXPERIAN has failed to conduct a thorough investigation or resolve these discrepancies within the required timeframe of 30 days. This negligence has led to the continued reporting of false information, which has negatively impacted on my creditworthiness.

In my request, I emphasized that any unverifiable information should be removed from my credit report INMEDEDIATLY within the mandated 30-day period, as established in 15 U.S. Code 1681i. Additionally, I referenced 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires that the procedures for including information in credit reports ensure maximum possible accuracy.

RE : Dispute Authorization and Multiple Violations of Fair Credit Reporting Act I, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, hereby authorize this dispute. It is important to note that this dispute was not sent by an unauthorized third party or "" credit clinic. '' I am writing to address several violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) that have occurred, which require your immediate attention and resolution. The violations are as follows : FCRA Section 607 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Consumer Right to Privacy : You are reporting fraudulent accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me, thus infringing upon my privacy rights. I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. I insist that my hard inquiries and account information not be shared on my credit report.

2024-12-08,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Privacy issues,"Hello, I am writing to formally report and request resolution for an urgent issue concerning my CareCredit credit card account issued by Synchrony Bank. Specifically, I have identified a concerning discrepancy regarding an unfamiliar phone number associated with my account. This inconsistency raises serious questions about the accuracy and security of my personal information. 

Details of the Issue : Unauthorized Phone Number : The credit cards app displays a phone number that does not belong to me but matches my fathers number. I have confirmed with him that he has been receiving access codes for getting into my account, which is both confusing and concerning. 
Customer Service Response : Despite contacting their team multiple times, I was assured that only my phone number is on file. This directly conflicts with the evidence I have, including a picture I took of the phone number on their app. 
Potential Security Concern : This discrepancy suggests a possible breach or technical error in their system. Unauthorized access to my accounts sensitive information could lead to significant security risks and I would like them to take immediate corrective action. 
Customer Service Experience : The dismissive attitude of their customer service agents has compounded my frustration. I called the CareCredit hotline multiple times in the past week regarding various issues surrounding my card, yet each time, my concerns were met with reassurances that do not align with the facts or address the core problem. On multiple occasions, agents downplayed the issue, referring to it as a glitch and implying there was nothing more to investigate. Some even went so far as to say, "" Well, the supervisor is just going to tell you the same thing I just told you, '' only for the supervisor to provide a different explanation that temporarily fixed the problem. Despite my persistence, these interactions have lacked the urgency and seriousness that this situation warrants, leaving me feeling disregarded and unsupported. 

Actions Requested : 1. Comprehensive Investigation : Please investigate how this phone number was associated with my account and provide a detailed explanation.

2. Immediate Correction : Ensure that the unauthorized phone number is removed and that all communications and access codes are directed solely to my verified contact information.

3. System Audit : Conduct a thorough review of your systems to identify and resolve any technical or procedural issues that may have contributed to this error.

4. Written Assurance : Provide written confirmation that my account information is secure and that steps have been taken to prevent future occurrences. 

Supporting Evidence : I have attached a screenshot from the app showing the unauthorized phone number. 

Additional Concerns : This is not the first issue I have encountered with CareCredit. For instance, I recently experienced a problem while traveling, despite having submitted a travel alert. My card was deactivated in XXXX, leaving me without access to funds. I explained to customer service that I would be stranded and they were initially unhelpful and unmoved, and the issue required intervention from a supervisor who easily reactivated the card and told me the complete opposite of what the agents initially told me. That was a dangerous situation. 

I've also had problems with cash advances recently. I filed a complaint against an operator who confidently told me that I'm unable to use my card for that and that getting transferred to the supervisor would yield the same results only to be told by the supervisor that I in fact can use my card in that manner. 

On top of all that, I've also been unable to access my rewards for the past month. They told me a ticket was submitted for the rewards issue but I never received confirmation. At the moment, I have more than XXXX points. These repeated incidents have further eroded my confidence in the reliability and security of this company. Moreover, this can happen to other customers. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Information on Credit Report and violation of the Fair credit reporting act. 
Complaint Summary : I am submitting this complaint against EXPERIAN regarding the inaccurate information reported in my credit report, which violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
On XXXX XX/XX/year> of Credit Report, I discovered discrepancies in the following account ( s ) : Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Disputed Information : Inaccuracies, account number is reported as incomplete, high balance is reported differently in the credit agencies, date of last activity, last payment, and credit. 

Under Section 611 of the FCRA, I have the right to dispute inaccuracies and request prompt investigation. I formally requested a reinvestigation of the account information and cited relevant sections of the FCRA, including : 1. Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Requirement for verification of accounts through original documentation.

2. Section 611 : Right to dispute inaccuracies and request investigation.

3. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) : Removal of unverifiable information dont validated for creditor Original.

4. 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires that the procedures for including information in credit reports ensure maximum possible accuracy Despite my request, EXPERIAN has failed to conduct a thorough investigation or resolve these discrepancies within the required timeframe of 30 days. This negligence has led to the continued reporting of false information, which has negatively impacted on my creditworthiness. 
In my request, I emphasized that any unverifiable information should be removed from my credit report INMEDEDIATLY within the mandated 30-day period, as established in 15 U.S. Code 1681i. Additionally, I referenced 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires that the procedures for including information in credit reports ensure maximum possible accuracy. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, furnishers of information are required to investigate and correct inaccurate information upon notice of a dispute.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,IN,46219,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11072264

Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 

YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown.

1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover
how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ). 

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes. 

The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"Experian has failed to conduct a proper and thorough investigation as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. The reporting of XXXX XXXX collection/Closed account on my credit report does not satisfy the FCRA 's requirement for maximum possible accuracy under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). To date, I have seen no evidence that a reasonable investigation was conducted, nor has any proof documented proof has been provided to determine the verification of such information Experian is reporting.

According to Section 611 of the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), Experian is required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information. This investigation must involve obtaining sufficient documentation to verify the validity and accuracy of the collection account. To ensure compliance with federal law, Experian must Obtain Original Source Documentation : This includes the original contract. Simply relying on information provided by the furnisher without reviewing original source documentation is insufficient to meet the statutory requirements. 

In XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), the court held that a credit reporting agency has an obligation to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy in consumer reports. Failure to verify the accuracy of disputed information and reliance solely on the furnishers ( XXXX XXXX ) response is not considered a reasonable procedure.

2024-12-08,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Personal line of credit,Getting a line of credit,,"I am filing a formal complaint against Upstart and its lending partners due to concerns over their denial of my loan application in a manner that I believe violates the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) and Regulation B. 
Details of the Issue : Applicant Name : XXXX XXXX Reference Number : XXXX Date of Adverse Action Notice : XX/XX/year> I applied for a loan through Upstart, providing secured collateral as part of the transaction. Despite this, my application was denied based on factors such as credit score, credit history, and income, as outlined in their Adverse Action Notice. I believe this decision and the evaluation process violate federal laws for the following reasons : 1. Failure to Properly Consider Secured Collateral : As a secured creditor, my application should not have been denied based solely on credit score or other traditional metrics when sufficient collateral was provided. Under ECOA ( 15 U.S.C. 1691 ), it is illegal to discriminate in credit transactions, including failing to appropriately assess applications involving secured collateral. 
2. Lack of Transparency in Decision-Making : Upstarts Adverse Action Notice does not explain how the collateral provided was factored into the decision or why my application was denied despite it. This lack of clarity does not align with Regulation B ( 12 CFR 1002 ), which requires creditors to provide specific and detailed reasons for adverse actions.

3. Potential Discrimination : The denial appears to have been based on traditional credit metrics that disproportionately impact certain consumers, particularly those with limited credit histories or non-traditional financial profiles. This may constitute an unfair practice under ECOA, which prohibits credit discrimination. 
Desired Resolution : I am seeking the following resolutions to address this matter : XXXX. Reconsideration of My Application : Request a re-evaluation of my application, taking into full account the collateral provided and my status as a secured creditor, rather than solely relying on traditional credit metrics. 
XXXX. Detailed Explanation of Decision : A clear, written explanation of how my application was evaluated, including how the collateral was considered and how the decision complies with ECOA and Regulation B.

3. Policy Review and Compliance Assurance : I request that Upstart review its credit decision-making policies and practices to ensure compliance with ECOA and Regulation B. This includes providing better transparency and accountability in evaluating secured transactions. 
XXXX. Removal of Any Adverse Credit Impact : If the denial resulted in negative impacts on my credit report ( e.g., inquiries or reporting of the denial ), I request corrective action to remove such entries. 
5. Assurances of Non-Discriminatory Practices : Upstart should commit to addressing any potential discriminatory practices in its lending decisions and provide evidence of corrective measures. 
Supporting Documents Enclosed : Adverse Action Notice dated XX/XX/year> Correspondence regarding the application ( if applicable ) [ Any other relevant documents ] I request that the CFPB investigate this matter to ensure compliance with federal laws and to promote fair and equitable lending practices.

2024-12-08,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"I am writing to formally notify Synchrony Bank of several serious violations of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), IRS Guidelines ( XXXX ), and other applicable laws. Additionally, I am demanding immediate corrective action regarding the misuse of my personal information, including its use in securities and stock trading, without my consent or any distribution of profits from such activities.

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Other Laws Right to Privacy - 15 U.S. Code 1681, Section 602 ( a ) : Under Section 602 ( a ) of the FCRA, I have the right to privacy with regard to my credit information. Synchrony Bank has violated this right by improperly disclosing or mishandling my personal financial information without my consent.

Prohibition on Furnishing Account Information Without Written Consent - 15 U.S. Code 1681, Section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) : Section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA clearly states that no consumer reporting agency may furnish my account information to third parties without my written authorization. Synchrony Bank has violated this provision by providing my account information to third parties without my express written consent. 

Exclusion of Certain Types of Information - 15 U.S. Code 1681a : According to Section 1681a, a consumer report does not include information solely related to transactions or experiences between a consumer and the entity making the report. Synchrony Bank appears to be reporting this type of information in my credit file, which is in direct violation of the statute. 

Late Payment Reporting Prohibited - 15 U.S. Code 1666b : Section 1666b prohibits a creditor from reporting a payment on an open-end consumer credit account as late unless the payment is genuinely overdue. Synchrony Bank has incorrectly reported a payment as late on my account, violating this provision. 

IRS Guidelines ( XXXX ) - Requirement for Issuing Form XXXX for Canceled Debt : IRS Guidelines XXXX XXXX ) define canceled debt as gross income and require the issuance of a Form 1099-C for any canceled debt. If my debt has been written off, Synchrony Bank has failed to issue this form, which is a violation of the Internal Revenue Code and further complicates the inaccuracies in your reporting. 

Unauthorized Use of Personal Information in Securities and Trading It has come to my attention that Synchrony Bank continues to use my personal financial information in securities, stocks, and other trade instruments, including securitization of accounts. This activity has been conducted without my consent or knowledge, and no portion of any profits generated has been returned to me. 

Per Synchrony 's filings and the continuous trade of my information until maturity, I assert that I, as the rightful owner of this personal data and associated rights, hereby claim all rights, title, and interest to the profits generated by such activities. These profits must be delivered back to me, or alternatively, I demand that you provide an open-ended credit card that will allow me to access these profits for my own financial gain. 

Failure to provide a remedy will result in a full securitization audit of your entire accounting ledger. This will include a review of all transactions, trades, and uses of my personal information. If Synchrony Bank has not disclosed these practices fully or transparently, this may result in further legal actions and penalties.

Legal Grounds for Demand and Remedies GAAP Accounting Standards : Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), companies are required to disclose the use and profitability of assets, including securitized accounts and personal information. If Synchrony Bank has been using my personal data as an asset in these transactions, you are required to disclose such actions and allocate profits to the rightful owner ( me ). Failure to do so violates GAAP, specifically the principles of disclosure and revenue recognition.

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : Under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), creditors are required to disclose all terms of credit, including any financial instruments or practices involving securitization of accounts and the use of consumer data. Synchrony Bank has failed to disclose this information adequately and transparently. This is a direct violation of the TILA, and I demand full transparency regarding any securities, investments, or other financial activities involving my personal data. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : The Court ruled that a consumer 's personal data is an asset, and any misuse or improper reporting can be grounds for damages, including emotional distress and punitive damages under the FCRA. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : The Court confirmed that the unauthorized use of personal data, especially in the context of securities and trading, constitutes a violation of privacy rights and may subject a company to both civil liability and damages. 

Immediate Actions Required Given the violations outlined above, I am requesting that Synchrony Bank take the following actions : Immediate Correction of Inaccurate Information : Correct all inaccuracies reported to the credit bureaus regarding my account, including the removal of any late payment markings that were incorrectly applied to my account. 

Issue a 1099-C Form : If any portion of my debt has been canceled, you are required by law to issue a Form 1099-C, reporting the canceled debt as gross income, as per IRS Guidelines ( XXXX ). 

Reinstatement of Privacy : Take immediate action to ensure that my personal data is no longer used for securities or trading without my consent and that any profits generated are returned to me or made available for my financial gain.

Full Disclosure : Provide full transparency regarding the use of my personal data in securities or stock trades and furnish a securitization audit if necessary. If no profits have been shared with me, I demand an open-ended credit card to access any potential profits derived from these activities.

Deadline for Resolution Please correct the inaccurate information, provide the requested documentation, and comply with my demands within 15 days of receiving this letter. Failure to do so will result in my filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), SEC and pursuing legal action, including seeking damages under the FCRA, GAAP accounting rules, TILA, and the relevant Supreme Court cases.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,GA,30047,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11074898

XXXX - NAVY FEDERAL CR UNION - DATE OPENED XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate reporting of the above-referenced account and to demand immediate corrective action pursuant to federal consumer protection laws, including but not limited to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. 

1. Dispute of Account Reporting This account has been reported as written off as a profit/loss ( charge-off ). However, I have identified that the account is being repeatedly reported as a new charge-off account with an outstanding balance, despite being previously written off. This constitutes inaccurate and misleading reporting in violation of the FCRA, specifically : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Duty to ensure maximum possible accuracy of information. 
15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : Duty to investigate disputes regarding furnished information.

By continuing to report this account inaccurately, Navy Federal Credit Union is damaging my creditworthiness, resulting in defamation of character and material harm to my financial reputation.

2. Request for 1099-C Issuance As the account has been charged off, I am requesting that you provide a copy of the IRS Form 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ). The issuance of this form is required when a debt is canceled or written off and no longer collectible. Failure to provide the required documentation further demonstrates non-compliance with applicable consumer protection laws.

3. Cease-and-Desist Notification Under the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ), this letter serves as a formal cease-and-desist notice regarding all collection efforts related to this account. You are instructed to cease all forms of communication with me, including but not limited to phone calls, emails, or letters, regarding this account.

4. Demand for Resolution To resolve this matter, I demand the following actions be taken within 30 days : Immediately correct and remove the inaccurate information from all credit reporting agencies.

Provide a copy of the IRS Form 1099-C for the cancellation of this account, if applicable.

This person was very pushy and was selling on a promotion for up to 50 % off if they check to see what I qualify for. I informed him that I had already check and was qualified for another card. I figured it could not hurt if they just check since I already know I qualify for the other card. I all of a sudden feel a lot of pressure to get the XXXX scheduled now so that I can save money. That the XXXX schedule was filling up fast so I needed to act. It was a very high pressure sell that I immediately regretted. Here I was signing up for a procedure before even having any consultation. 

The initial consultation was scheduled for XX/XX/year> and I had the XXXX scheduled for XX/XX/year> that was made on XX/XX/year> on that phone call with the solicitor from the doctor 's office. This meant that I was now scheduled for a procedure in 3 weeks when I hadn't even had my first consultation. I had scheduled consultations with 3 doctors so that way I was confident I made the right decision. I immediately contacted the doctor 's office to let them know that I did not want to move forward with the procedure.

XXXX, part of Comenity Capital Bank, has a policy that if you are not satisfied with the services then I many not be held financially responsible for the remaining balance. I informed them that I was indeed not satisfied and wanted a full refund. The doctor 's office agreed to refund {$5800.00} after telling me that I would not get a refund if I did not remove any complaints about the doctor 's office.

Now the two accounts are separated one account for the washer and one account for the dryer. I paid an original deposit for the set of washer and dryer and during the delivery mixup I had to pay another deposit for the dryer again and they couldnt fix that.

They told me to still pay that amount to avoid adversities on my credit, as of now they still have not fixed the loan account documentation to reflect the actual amount borrowed to correct the payments over a 12 month timeline and instead they have charged me late fees, additional interest, and they have yet to rectify the account to reflect what I actually borrowed, even after me calling and speaking with a manager.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Lender filed on my credit report that I was late when I was in active Loss Mitigation with them. Their fraudulent filing of my account status occurred after I followed all of their requests to the letter post Hurricane disaster declaration in Florida, as of XX/XX/XXXX when I filed a request with XXXX XXXX ( VA Loan Servicer ) for Hurricane Relief after Hurricane Idalia hit our area and disaster declared by state FL. I was granted 6 months of payments relief with understanding of sending updated information to Lender/servicer of personal financials and did so 5 times from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX. Lender deleted my account portal information from their system twice during this time and in turn claimed in XX/XX/XXXX I was not on active Loss Mitigation status after XX/XX/XXXX. However that is untrue and I have the phone call records, portal copies of my uploads of compliant information they needed to rebuild their records however to date XXXX Loss Mitigation department continues to deny they made multiple errors by filing my loan to be late as of XX/XX/XXXX. I paid the full amount due in XX/XX/XXXX in question for the Loss Mitigation status period of time from XX/XX/XXXX to the last submission of my personal information to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Again I have a record of all correspondences sent to the lender portal on the line, a record of all those files sent, a record of who I spoke to each time I spoke to the Loss Mitigation department on the phone. XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from VA representative asking if I was working through the information needed to get my loan caught up through adding on the Loss Mitigation period of time to my loan balance. They claimed they had not heard from XXXXXXXX XXXX with the facts and asked that I send them an email outline which I did. I then sent financial information to XXXX just as XXXX asked me to do the first time being XX/XX/XXXX. 
I requested a review from XXXXXXXX XXXX customer service 7 times in XXXX so far, told them their information is incorrect to file on my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX that I was late, when in fact I was declared by their own staff I was in Loss Mitigation and no late payment reporting would occur. I submitted my personal information through the portal on the line with XXXXXXXX XXXX  5 times. Each time I submitted the requested information from the lender I would receive a phone call approximately 1 week later telling me they are working on my file. I would also receive a mailing in the same time frame they are actively working on my file for Loss Mitigation. As of XX/XX/XXXX roughly 3 months into the relief time period of months I was given I began sending updated financials to the lender showing all of the details they needed to allow me to add a balance of missed payments from during Loss Mitigation to the back side of my loan balance. That is what was offered and that is what I was working towards. After that phone call from the VA rep XXXXXXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX I made sure i was to follow all requests to the letter by the book so this would stay on track and the relief I sought be resolved properly. 
However, after sending my details to the lender 5 times submitted, following all instructions, waiting for the lender to make decisions if they would allow me to add a balance to the backside of my loan, they came up with an offer that would not work for my existing loan of which I already had for 10 years of the 30 year term paid down. 
It was XX/XX/XXXX I received a less than valid offer to change my interest rate and get hammered by even higher loan rates than I would be comfortable with. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX Loss Mitigation again for what would be the 10th time I spoke to them on the phone and let them know their offer was no good and I would pay the remaining 3 months off from the Loss Mitigation period of time by no later than XX/XX/XXXX XXXX.I paid the loan current on the date agreed and received confirmation from XXXX they received my funds and credited the account as agreed. I was told Loss Mitigation is over and went on my way making payments as was normal for me to do. You see I began paying the loan on time again as I agreed to do with XXXX XXXX starting in XXXX XXXX when they continued to agree with Loss Mitigation , I would submit the information they requested from me, I spoke with XXXX Loss Mitigation and customer service at least 5 times from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX regarding keeping the payments to restart around XX/XX/XXXX while I was in active Loss Mitigation. I wanted to make sure I stayed in touch and informed so my file would stay current and I asked many times that my credit is not going to be given any late fee notes etc. while we worked through the process ; to which I was assured I would not receive late notices, no late penalties and no late fees. In turn I began all information submissions as XXXX  requested, and I restarted payments in XXXX which was 2 months earlier than the 6 months I was granted of payment forgiveness/forbearance as they agreed to allow me during the Hurricane Relief act. 
However little did I know that XXXX filed my Loss Mitigation request as a Covid Relief Act request ; which it clearly was not and when I found that out from their customer service in XX/XX/XXXX I immediately demanded they fix the record to show I was in the post Hurricane Idalia Relief Loss Mitigation program ; NOT a Covid relief. That was the first time I realized something did not seem right about XXXXXXXX XXXX and their apparent lack of integrity. I began making regular monthly mortgage payments again as stated in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX which XXXX happily accepted my money over the phone via call-in payments as they requested. 
I have all the documents of all the correspondences from and to XXXXXXXX XXXX and VA rep XXXX XXXX whom I made aware of my problems with XXXX again in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX because I did not want my mortgage to be at risk nor my exemplary credit rating of XXXX in the same time period we are talking about. 
I received the new financing offer from XXXXXXXX XXXX to subjugate my mortgage balance to add the three Loss Mitigation months of payments remained due as of when I restarted making the regular monthly payments as stated above in XXXX XXXX. The offer was horrible and contained additional fees and a terrible interest rate I was in no way going to agree to. As stated above I called them within 5 days of receiving the letter and told their team I would be paying the past Loss Mitigation period payments off XXXX XX/XX/XXXX as stated and I did so. 
All the while I was making the payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX and I was told each time I called in the payments that my loan is reported as been paid on time and all was good. The entire time I relied on the statements from XXXX XXXX  staff members as stated above. As well I received many continued requests for information of my financial details which I repeatedly agreed to do and provided to the staff immediately upon receiving their requests. 
The problem comes in that also in XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX took it upon themselves to file three credit report updates stating my loan was 150 days late, 120 days late, 30 days late then not late all within 2 weeks of one another. My Experian credit monitoring report shows all these details, I have tried a half dozen times to get XXXX to fix this. I have called their teams, I have sent them 12 messages through the portal on my account profile and they continue to refuse to fix their mistakes. The key proving that XXXX XXXX  is not only liable for filing fraudulent account statuses during their agreement I was in active Loss Mitigation, is the fact they removed my online portal access twice during the Loss mitigation period, deleted 4 months worth of messages from my profile where they received my financial details, they agreed to me sending this information through their portal as that is where they requested it since it is secure comm 's for this purpose of sending them my personal financial details. I have screen shots of my missing communications from their website portal, they deny any wrongdoing and they deny they deleted my files. However, the proof they received my files when I sent them is because their system auto generates an account email to state "" we have received your message ( XXXX ) '' and this is their request to send them the information the was I was sending it to them. 
The damage has been done to my credit rating as soon as XXXX filed their fraudulent statement of my account status after I paid them the Loss Mitigation amounts. My rating went from XXXX as I said above to roughly XXXX, and on the day they filed the experian report on my credit my score dropped at that moment XXXX points alone on that one day, then dropped again when they failed to update it correctly and allowing my account to get hammered and score dropped like a rock as I said. 
In XXXX if I had known that XXXX would intentionally have done this fraudulent filing of which affected my credit score as it did described herein I would not have been so nice to their staff as I have been since that time demanding they fix their incorrect filings and get my record straightened out rather than allow it reported late of 150 days within two weeks of my paying the account Loss Mitigation time period payments up to date. Why would I have agreed to allow them to do this, I wouldn't that is what the issue is. They did this after I paid them up from this forbearance period of time. Why else would their system continue to ask me for information and why would I receive their correspondence during the time frame I was told I was in Loss Mitigation status and my loan would not be reported late at all. But the proof is they would not arbitrarily send me this type correspondence had they not been receiving my details over and over each time they received my updated financials. Why else would they allow Loss Mitigation to continue to occur if they were not receiving my information, why else would I have 12 phone calls with their staff and the VA rep XXXXXXXX XXXX if I weren't in active Loss Mitigation? The answer is simple and it's XXXX XXXXXXXX lying about my Payments status, my Loss Mitigation Status, lying to me about deleting my account portal documents and details I sent them from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. As soon as I found this file information was missing from my portal, I immediately contacted them and told them it was missing and they needed to get it put back on my account because it is the proof I was complying with all requests. 
The further proof I can prove XXXX XXXX is scheming and lying about this is why else would they have continued to send me documents requests I updated my files with based on their received information on the portal, but they then scrubbed the portal of the information and files I sent them during this time. They still ahve the time prior to XX/XX/XXXX and after XX/XX/XXXX on my portal dashboard which includes all of my requests they need to fix my credit reporting and also that I agreed to pay up the Loss Mitigation period of time payments. They scrubbed this information from the portal only when I sent them a request to answer why they suddenly reported my loan 150 days late a month after I paid them up to date on the Loss Mitigation amount due. Paid up and followed their every demand, their staff answered me each time I spoke to them and said my account was in Loss Mitigation status, was not being reported late. I have all of these documents, and all of these details in hand. 
I have warned XXXXXXXX XXXX via secure messaging on the portal since XXXX more than enough times and they claim they are not changing their credit reporting even after they were told they filed the Covid relief incorrectly, and all other things incorrectly. That is why I think they scrubbed the messaging file of my data for those months in question because they fraudulently collected Covid funds on my behalf and that can be a problem for them. 
I would hate to file a fraud claim against XXXX XXXX with the FBI for wire fraud but I will do so as I am well aware of my rights against this malpractice they are guilty of doing to me and costing my credit score to be damaged in dramatic fashion as I have stated. 
All of these statements have the paperwork to back them up, and I have warned XXXXXXXX XXXX  staff I was going to proceed with this claim because they offer me no other alternative to get my credit reporting corrected. 
This is the second instance of a fatal error on my account by XXXXXXXX XXXX when they took over servicing my mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXXXXXX XXXX. XXXX failed to timely pay my property flood insurance policy in XX/XX/XXXX even after they were warned they needed to send the remittance, when my agent reached out to them, they have the calling records to prove it, and the email threads with XXXXXXXX XXXX Insurance department personnel as proof. When this occurred the missed payments caused my flood insurance to lapse ( my insurance is escrowed in my payments ), and turn my policy with its grandfathered parameters was then cancelled and I received a 3 times more expensive flood insurance policy from the same carrier because XXXXXXXX XXXX made these mistakes and we have the proof of all of these details as well. 
To date XXXXXXXX XXXX has cost me more than XXXX credit points on my credit rating, and cost me more than {$5000.00} per year in additional insurance costs due to them not paying my premiums on time for renewal as of XX/XX/XXXX caused the policy to lapse even after being warned repeatedly by my insurance agents, and also by my phone calls to their customer service department. This again has not been mitigated by XXXXXXXX XXXX nor will they do anything about it. I have a feeling they need to be sued to get them to respond to all of this with an effective solution. 
I feel they are dismissing my rights, misrepresenting my credit worthiness by not correcting my personal credit file ( also the same issue on my wife 's credit reporting has been done and her score dropped just the same at the same exact times as stated above ). I want XXXXXXXX XXXX to be investigated fully, as I can only imagine they have done this same thing to others along the way. The problem I have with changing to another lender is my loan interest rate is 3.5 % and you know I can not get that rate any longer. 
Please help me, please get the lender to fix my credit reporting, have them fix my customer account portal and return all of my files and information promptly, go back review their files for missed payments on my flood insurance policy from XXXX and make it right to fix all of their mistakes on my account information promptly. I will hold off filing a fraudulent inducement, and wire fraud complaint against them with the FBI pending the outcome of your investigation.

However little did I know that Freedom filed my Loss Mitigation request as a Covid Relief Act request ; which it clearly was not and when I found that out from their customer service in XX/XX/XXXX I immediately demanded they fix the record to show I was in the post Hurricane Idalia Relief Loss Mitigation program ; NOT a Covid relief. That was the first time I realized something did not seem right about Freedom Mortgage and their apparent lack of integrity. I began making regular monthly mortgage payments again as stated in XXXX XXXX XXXX which Freedom happily accepted my money over the phone via call-in payments as they requested. 
I have all the documents of all the correspondences from and to Freedom Mortgage and VA rep XXXX XXXX  whom I made aware of my problems with Freedom again in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX because I did not want my mortgage to be at risk nor my exemplary credit rating of XXXX in the same time period we are talking about. 
I received the new financing offer from Freedom Mortgage to subjugate my mortgage balance to add the three Loss Mitigation months of payments remained due as of when I restarted making the regular monthly payments as stated above in XXXX XXXX. The offer was horrible and contained additional fees and a terrible interest rate I was in no way going to agree to. As stated above I called them within 5 days of receiving the letter and told their team I would be paying the past Loss Mitigation period payments off XXXX XX/XX/XXXX as stated and I did so. 
All the while I was making the payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX and I was told each time I called in the payments that my loan is reported as been paid on time and all was good. The entire time I relied on the statements from Freedom Mortgage staff members as stated above. As well I received many continued requests for information of my financial details which I repeatedly agreed to do and provided to the staff immediately upon receiving their requests. 
The problem comes in that also in XX/XX/XXXX when Freedom took it upon themselves to file three credit report updates stating my loan was 150 days late, 120 days late, 30 days late then not late all within 2 weeks of one another. My XXXX  credit monitoring report shows all these details, I have tried a half dozen times to get Freedom to fix this. I have called their teams, I have sent them 12 messages through the portal on my account profile and they continue to refuse to fix their mistakes. The key proving that Freedom Mortgage is not only liable for filing fraudulent account statuses during their agreement I was in active Loss Mitigation, is the fact they removed my online portal access twice during the Loss mitigation period, deleted 4 months worth of messages from my profile where they received my financial details, they agreed to me sending this information through their portal as that is where they requested it since it is secure comm 's for this purpose of sending them my personal financial details. I have screen shots of my missing communications from their website portal, they deny any wrongdoing and they deny they deleted my files. However, the proof they received my files when I sent them is because their system auto generates an account email to state "" we have received your message ( XXXX ) '' and this is their request to send them the information the was I was sending it to them. 
The damage has been done to my credit rating as soon as Freedom filed their fraudulent statement of my account status after I paid them the Loss Mitigation amounts. My rating went from XXXX as I said above to roughly XXXX, and on the day they filed the XXXX  report on my credit my score dropped at that moment XXXX points alone on that one day, then dropped again when they failed to update it correctly and allowing my account to get hammered and score dropped like a rock as I said. 
In XXXX if I had known that Freedom would intentionally have done this fraudulent filing of which affected my credit score as it did described herein I would not have been so nice to their staff as I have been since that time demanding they fix their incorrect filings and get my record straightened out rather than allow it reported late of 150 days within two weeks of my paying the account Loss Mitigation time period payments up to date. Why would I have agreed to allow them to do this, I wouldn't that is what the issue is. They did this after I paid them up from this forbearance period of time. Why else would their system continue to ask me for information and why would I receive their correspondence during the time frame I was told I was in Loss Mitigation status and my loan would not be reported late at all. But the proof is they would not arbitrarily send me this type correspondence had they not been receiving my details over and over each time they received my updated financials. Why else would they allow Loss Mitigation to continue to occur if they were not receiving my information, why else would I have 12 phone calls with their staff and the VA rep XXXXXXXX XXXX if I weren't in active Loss Mitigation? The answer is simple and it's Freedom Mortgage lying about my Payments status, my Loss Mitigation Status, lying to me about deleting my account portal documents and details I sent them from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. As soon as I found this file information was missing from my portal, I immediately contacted them and told them it was missing and they needed to get it put back on my account because it is the proof I was complying with all requests. 
The further proof I can prove Freedom Mortgage is scheming and lying about this is why else would they have continued to send me documents requests I updated my files with based on their received information on the portal, but they then scrubbed the portal of the information and files I sent them during this time. They still ahve the time prior to XX/XX/XXXX and after XX/XX/XXXX on my portal dashboard which includes all of my requests they need to fix my credit reporting and also that I agreed to pay up the Loss Mitigation period of time payments. They scrubbed this information from the portal only when I sent them a request to answer why they suddenly reported my loan 150 days late a month after I paid them up to date on the Loss Mitigation amount due. Paid up and followed their every demand, their staff answered me each time I spoke to them and said my account was in Loss Mitigation status, was not being reported late. I have all of these documents, and all of these details in hand. 
I have warned Freedom Mortgage via secure messaging on the portal since XXXX more than enough times and they claim they are not changing their credit reporting even after they were told they filed the Covid relief incorrectly, and all other things incorrectly. That is why I think they scrubbed the messaging file of my data for those months in question because they fraudulently collected Covid funds on my behalf and that can be a problem for them. 
I would hate to file a fraud claim against Freedom Mortgage with the FBI for wire fraud but I will do so as I am well aware of my rights against this malpractice they are guilty of doing to me and costing my credit score to be damaged in dramatic fashion as I have stated.

All of these statements have the paperwork to back them up, and I have warned Freedom 's staff I was going to proceed with this claim because they offer me no other alternative to get my credit reporting corrected. 
This is the second instance of a fatal error on my account by Freedom Mortgage when they took over servicing my mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX  Freedom failed to timely pay my property flood insurance policy in XX/XX/XXXX even after they were warned they needed to send the remittance, when my agent reached out to them, they have the calling records to prove it, and the email threads with Freedom Mortgage Insurance department personnel as proof. When this occurred the missed payments caused my flood insurance to lapse ( my insurance is escrowed in my payments ), and turn my policy with its grandfathered parameters was then cancelled and I received a 3 times more expensive flood insurance policy from the same carrier because Freedom Mortgage made these mistakes and we have the proof of all of these details as well. 
To date Freedom Mortgage has cost me more than XXXX credit points on my credit rating, and cost me more than {$5000.00} per year in additional insurance costs due to them not paying my premiums on time for renewal as of XX/XX/XXXX caused the policy to lapse even after being warned repeatedly by my insurance agents, and also by my phone calls to their customer service department. This again has not been mitigated by Freedom Mortgage nor will they do anything about it. I have a feeling they need to be sued to get them to respond to all of this with an effective solution. 
I feel they are dismissing my rights, misrepresenting my credit worthiness by not correcting my personal credit file ( also the same issue on my wife 's credit reporting has been done and her score dropped just the same at the same exact times as stated above ). I want Freedom Mortgage to be investigated fully, as I can only imagine they have done this same thing to others along the way. The problem I have with changing to another lender is my loan interest rate is 3.5 % and you know I can not get that rate any longer. 
Please help me, please get the lender to fix my credit reporting, have them fix my customer account portal and return all of my files and information promptly, go back review their files for missed payments on my flood insurance policy from XXXX and make it right to fix all of their mistakes on my account information promptly. I will hold off filing a fraudulent inducement, and wire fraud complaint against them with the FBI pending the outcome of your investigation.

TransUnion LLC Subject : Urgent Demand for Removal of Unauthorized Accounts and Violations of Federal Law XXXX  has demonstrated a clear failure to maintain consistency and transparency in its handling of your dispute, further compounding the harm caused by its already unlawful practices. On one hand, XXXX sent written correspondence stating that your disputes were deemed frivolous because they were previously verified or lacked new relevant information. Yet, when you called XXXX representatives, they contradicted this claim by asserting that the FTC report you submitted, along with other supporting documents, was invalid or not reflected in their system. This blatant inconsistency in communication highlights systemic negligence, internal disorganization, and possibly intentional efforts to delay or obstruct dispute resolution. 

Key Issues with XXXX Contradictions 1. Misleading Written Statements : The letter implied that your disputes were frivolous, suggesting there was no new information to warrant further investigation. However, the supporting documentation you submitted, including proof of identification, proof of address, and the FTC Identity Theft Report, satisfies the requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 for blocking disputed items. 
2. Disregard of Submitted Documents : XXXX  claim during your phone call that the FTC report was invalid reflects either a failure to properly process submitted documents or intentional misrepresentation of its obligations under federal law. 
XXXX. Obstruction of Consumer Rights : The conflicting statements prevent you from effectively resolving the dispute and exercising your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). By sending contradictory information, XXXX undermines its obligation to provide a clear and efficient dispute resolution process. 
4. Possible Profit-Driven Motives : The delays caused by these contradictory statements may be a tactic to continue profiting from unauthorized or inaccurate information on your credit report, as credit reporting agencies often benefit financially from retaining more data on consumers. 
5. Violation of FCRA Procedures : According to 15 U.S.C. 1681i, XXXX must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information and can not arbitrarily declare disputes frivolous, especially when documentation is provided. 

Legal and Regulatory Implications 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : XXXX must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information on your credit report. Failing to process valid disputes and providing contradictory information violates this mandate. 
15 U.S.C. 1681n : Willful noncompliance with the FCRA exposes XXXX to statutory, actual, and punitive damages. 
Section 5 ( a ) of the FTC Act : Misleading consumers through contradictory communication may constitute unfair and deceptive practices, subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 
Consumer Financial Protection Act ( 12 U.S.C. 5536 ) : XXXX actions may violate the prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ). 

Demand for Accountability XXXX  inability to provide consistent and accurate information underscores a broader systemic failure within its dispute resolution processes. I will not tolerate the continued violation of my rights. Your contradictory communications must be resolved, and the following actions must be taken immediately : 1. Remove all unauthorized accounts and information in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2.

2. Provide a written explanation reconciling the discrepancies between your written and verbal statements.

3. Implement internal compliance measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future. 





To Whom It May Concern, This formal complaint demands the immediate removal of unauthorized accounts and inaccurate information from my consumer report. Despite my compliance with all legal requirements under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( Section 605C2 ), these accounts remain unlawfully reported. Furthermore, I have IRS-confirmed evidence of Form 1099-C cancellation for the debts associated with these accounts, proving they are no longer valid or collectible. 
The fact that these canceled accounts remain on my report, despite their resolution with the IRS, demonstrates not only your noncompliance with federal law but also a potential fraudulent financial intent. If these items are not promptly removed, I reserve the right to report your continued actions to the IRS under their whistleblower program, as the profit gained from unauthorized reporting constitutes tax fraud and abuse. 
Accounts to Be Removed Immediately : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  : Account XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Account XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX : Account XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX : Account XXXX XXXX. XXXXXXXX XXXX : Account XXXX Violations of Federal Law and Additional Actions : 1. FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 : All disputed information must be blocked within four ( 4 ) business days upon submission of proper documentation. Despite fulfilling all requirements, including FTC Identity Theft Report, identification, and proof of address, these accounts remain unblocked.

2. IRS Reporting Requirements : The debts associated with the accounts above have been canceled via Form 1099-C and accepted by the IRS. Continuing to report these accounts as valid debts constitutes a misrepresentation of their status. Additionally, this behavior indicates potential violations of tax laws if these debts are used for financial gain or inaccurate reporting purposes.

3. Fraudulent Intent and Misrepresentation : By retaining and profiting from inaccurate and unauthorized information, your actions may violate 18 U.S.C. 1962 ( RICO ) and 18 U.S.C. 894 ( Extortionate Credit Practices ).

4. Whistleblower and Audit Risk : If this noncompliance persists, I will report your activities to the IRS for further investigation and audit. The whistleblower program rewards accurate reporting of tax fraud and abuse, which includes the exploitation of consumer data for monetary gain.

5. Breach of Consumer Rights : Your failure to remove canceled debts constitutes ongoing harm to my financial reputation, with severe consequences for your compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681b and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act protections. 
Immediate Demands : 1. Immediate Removal of All Accounts Listed : All canceled debts and unauthorized accounts must be removed from my credit report within seven ( 7 ) business days of receiving this notice. 
2. Written Confirmation of Compliance : Provide written confirmation that these accounts have been permanently removed and will not be re-reported. 
3. IRS Whistleblower Avoidance : Take corrective action immediately to avoid being reported for fraudulent financial practices and unauthorized profit from canceled debts. 
Conclusion : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX continued failure to comply with federal law is a direct attack on my financial stability and consumer rights. I have met all requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, and the additional inclusion of 1099-C evidence further cements that these accounts have no basis for continued reporting. 
This is your final opportunity to resolve this matter. Failure to comply will result in further escalations, including filing whistleblower complaints with the IRS and pursuing legal remedies for damages under the FCRA, CFPB regulations, and RICO statutes.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,33993,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11071614

Despite my disputes, these errors remain unresolved, causing harm to my credit profile and financial stability. The details of the inaccuracies and violations are outlined below : Inaccuracies Identified : Payment Status : The account is listed as Collection/Charge-off, with a past due amount of {$2900.00}, even though the account shows a closed date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
The account status should not reflect ongoing derogatory reporting for a balance that was charged off over four years ago. 
Discrepancy in Reporting Date : The date of last activity is listed as XX/XX/XXXX, but the last payment date is shown as XX/XX/XXXX, which is inconsistent and impossible. 
This discrepancy violates the requirement for accurate and consistent reporting under the FCRA. 
Balance Owed and Payment Amount : The balance owed is reported as {$2900.00}, yet the payment amount is listed as {$0.00}, indicating no payment activity.

FCRA Violations : Failure to Report Accurate Information ( 607 ( b ) ) : Credit reporting agencies must ensure maximum possible accuracy. The conflicting dates and payment status indicate a failure to meet this obligation. 
Failure to Correct Errors After Dispute ( 611 ) : Despite my previous disputes, the inaccuracies remain unresolved, violating the FCRA requirement to correct or delete inaccurate information within 30 days. 
Supporting Evidence : I have documentation, including dispute letters and proof of delivery, that demonstrate my attempts to resolve these errors. 

Requested Action : Deletion of the Capital One account due to the conflicting information and unresolved inaccuracies. 
Correction of all reporting discrepancies to ensure compliance with the FCRA.

2024-12-08,Debt collection,Medical debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am filing a complaint against IC System XXXX for improperly reporting a fraudulent medical debt to credit bureaus and failing to contact me or verify the accuracy of the debt before sending it to collections. I believe their actions violate fair debt collection practices and have caused undue harm to my credit. 

Details of the Complaint Debt Collection Account : IC System XXXX opened a collection account on my credit on XX/XX/year>, for a medical debt. The agency never contacted me by mail, email, or telephone before reporting the debt to the credit bureaus, despite having all my correct contact information. 

Inaccurate XXXX XXXX : The amount reported by IC System XXXX does not match the amount billed by the medical provider. The collection agency admitted they did not verify the accuracy of the debt before sending it to collections. They stated that they don't have a copy of the bill for review. 

Underlying XXXX XXXX XXXX The medical debt in question arises from fraudulent billing practices by the medical provider, including : - Billing for unauthorized services that my PCP never ordered. 
- Billing for services not rendered or performed. 
- Billing for unnecessary services. 
- Bill for unbundling ( e.g., splitting services into separate bills to inflate costs ). 
- Falsifying my medical records to support unnecessary charges. 

Concerns of XXXX fraud at XXXX Imaging Specialists ( XXXX XXXX, CA ) : My PCP ordered XXXX ultrasound and one preventative mammogram but the radiologist, XXXX XXXX, billed for XXXX services in a single visit. For example, radiologist billed for a sonogram that was unauthorized and unnecessary, in addition to the authorized ultrasound that came out negative. Radiologist charged for a diagnostic mammogram in addition to the preventative mammogram for the same XXXX during the same visit. She billed me for the preventative mammogram by using unauthorized codes to inflate the bill. She created a second, false bill by alleging a second visit, which never occurred. She falsified my medical record to support her unauthorized services, by claiming that she found a suspicious lump. However, my PCP examined my XXXX after her report, and found that there was no XXXX lump of any kind. The medical provider has refused to correct the bill and has threatened to double the amount if unpaid, a practice I believe is illegal. This provider is currently under FBI investigation, with over XXXX other patients reporting similar fraudulent schemes. 

Impact on My Credit : The medical debt was reported to credit bureaus without my knowledge and began affecting my XXXX XXXX before I was notified. 

IC System XXXX failed to : - Verify the debt with the medical provider to ensure it was accurate or legitimate. 
- Attempt to contact me before or after reporting the debt. 
- When I contacted IC System XXXX, they confirmed they lacked a copy of the bill and had not verified its accuracy. Their failure to follow proper procedures has compounded the harm caused by the fraudulent medical provider.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"I.C.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To : XXXX, XXXX and TransUnion I am writing to formally address the ongoing inaccuracies and reporting violations on my credit reports. Despite my previous attempts to resolve these issues, the inaccurate information remains, and the credit bureaus have failed to respond appropriately. The continued inaction and false reporting of my personal information are direct violations of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other applicable federal and state laws. 

Accounts to be Corrected : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) The inaccurate information reported by XXXX on my credit report, including incorrect account status, balances, or any other erroneous reporting, must be corrected. If this account has been reported as open or active while it is closed, or if there are any discrepancies with the dates and balance reported, this must be corrected immediately. 

XXXX XXXX  Similarly XXXX XXXX XXXX  has reported inaccurate information on my credit file. This includes any incorrect account status or outstanding balances that do not reflect the actual state of the account. The account status, dates, and balances reported by XXXX XXXX  must be verified and corrected immediately. 

Unauthorized Hard Inquiries Additionally, I have noticed multiple unauthorized hard inquiries that were made to my credit report without my consent. According to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( c ), no one may obtain a credit report or perform a hard inquiry without my written consent. These inquiries need to be removed immediately as they were made in violation of my rights under the FCRA.

Legal Violations : Failure to Correct Inaccurate Information - 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( e ) : Under 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( e ), you are required to investigate and correct any inaccuracies in my credit report upon receiving a dispute. Despite my prior notifications, the inaccuracies remain uncorrected, violating this provision.

Failure to Provide Results of Investigation - 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( i ) : 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( i ) mandates that you conduct a reasonable investigation upon receiving notice of a dispute and provide the results of that investigation. The continued reporting of false information after I have disputed it is a violation of this statute.

Violation of Consumer Protection Laws- HJR 192, REMED, 1099C & 1099A : The HJR 192 REMED resolution and the 1099C and 1099A guidelines require that if a debt is written off or canceled, it must be reported as such, and a 1099-C form should be issued. I have never received such documentation, and the reporting of this debt as active is a clear violation of these rules.

Failure to Remove Inaccurate Information - FCRA Section 611 ( AX1 ) and FCRA Section 605 ( c ) : FCRA Section 611 ( AX1 ) requires the removal of inaccurate or unverifiable information upon investigation. Furthermore, FCRA Section 605 ( c ) restricts the reporting of certain negative information beyond a specific timeframe, and your continued reporting of this account is in violation of this limitation.

Right to Rescind Credit Transactions- 15 U.S. Code 1635 : According to 15 U.S. Code 1635, I have the right to rescind credit transactions under specific circumstances. The continued erroneous reporting of my credit history disregards this right, particularly regarding debts that may be canceled or rescinded.

Debt Collection Violations- 15 U.S. Code 1692 : Under 15 U.S. Code 1692, debt collectors are prohibited from reporting false or misleading information to credit reporting agencies. The account being reported on my credit file is inaccurate, and there has been no action taken to rectify this violation.

Errors in Credit Report : I find that the following information provided on my credit report is an error. This account was never late or owed any amount ( pursuant to HJR 192 REMED ). You are alleging that I owe a debt without furnishing any proof of this debt, including a full accounting ledger or proof of any 1099s that were filed on behalf of my principal. You have failed to demonstrate that you have followed all relevant laws and regulations for reporting this debt.

Therefore, you must remove this account from my credit report immediately.

It is against the law to report any information that has not been proven accurate. Under Georgia law, including provisions found in Georgia Code Title 7 - Banking and Finance, and under relevant statutes such as Georgias Fair Business Practices Act ( FBPA ), a deficiency claim can not be asserted unless all required notices were properly and timely given, and all allowable redemption and cure time limits were adhered to.

Additionally, as outlined in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are required to adhere to the following provisions : 15 U.S.C. 1692a ( 1-7 ) : Definitions and regulations governing what constitutes fair and unfair practices in debt collection.

15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 1-12 ) : Prohibits false or misleading representations in connection with debt collection.

15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a-c ) : Requires validation of debts upon request, including the provision of evidence supporting any alleged debt.

15 U.S.C. 1666 : Governs billing errors and prohibits creditors from imposing unauthorized fees.

15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) : Requires accurate reporting of information and protection of consumer privacy.

Supreme Court Cases : TransUnion LLC XXXX XXXX, 141 S. Ct. 2190 ( 2021 ) : The U.S. Supreme Court in TransUnion LLC XXXX XXXX emphasized that a consumer reporting agency must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information it provides to others. If the information being reported is inaccurate, the consumer has the right to dispute and seek correction. This case reinforces my right to challenge and have corrected any inaccuracies that are being reported about my credit file.

Spokeo , Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540 ( 2016 ) : In Spokeo v. Robins, the Supreme Court held that a consumer must demonstrate a concrete injury in order to bring a claim under the FCRA. The Court made it clear that when a consumer 's personal information is misused, especially in ways that can harm their financial reputation, they are entitled to seek legal remedies. The inaccurate reporting and unauthorized hard inquiries on my credit report have caused harm, and I am entitled to seek remedies under these precedents.

Consequences of Non-Compliance : The alleged claim of a deficiency is null and void, and any continued collection activities or reporting of this invalid claim on my credit reports will be considered a violation of the FDCPA and FCRA.

If you fail to comply with the above requests, I reserve all rights to seek damages against all parties involved under applicable state, federal, and Georgia-specific remedies.

Legal Demand : Under the FCRA and Georgia law, you are required by law to ensure the accuracy of all information reported. The continued failure to correct these inaccuracies despite repeated notifications is a direct violation of federal consumer protection laws.

In addition to correcting the inaccuracies, I am entitled to damages under the FCRA, including actual damages, punitive damages up to {$1000.00}, and attorney fees. Moreover, I am entitled to damages for XXXX XXXX  in the amount of {$10000.00} due to the ongoing distress caused by the inaccurate reporting and the misuse of my personal information. 

Total Damages : Actual Damages : To be determined based on the impact this has had on my financial health. 

Punitive Damages : Up to {$1000.00} under the FCRA. 
Attorney Fees : To be determined. 
XXXX XXXX : {$10000.00} each for emotional distress caused by the continued reporting of inaccurate information, unauthorized use of my data, and the failure to correct these errors. 

Risk of Further Legal Claims : As a data furnishing company involved in the buying, selling, transferring, and securitizing accounts and personal information, you are privately profiting off my personal information. This practice not only increases the risk of data breaches but also raises concerns about identity theft. 

These activities expose you to the potential for legal claims due to mishandling consumer data and may place you at significant risk for further legal consequences. I want to make it clear that continuing these practices could expose you to claims related to past data breaches, identity theft, and violations of consumer protection laws.

If this situation is not resolved promptly, you may face additional claims for damages resulting from these violations.

Corrective Action Required : Immediate Removal of the inaccurate information from my credit reports, including the incorrect account status, dates, and balances on all three credit bureaus.

Verification of Debt : Provide proof that the reported debt is accurate, and if it is a written-off account, issue a 1099-C form as required.

Investigation Results : Provide written confirmation that a reasonable investigation has been conducted, and include the results of the investigation and any corrective actions taken.

Removal of Unauthorized Hard Inquiries : All unauthorized hard inquiries on my credit report must be immediately removed, as they were made without my written consent.

Deadline for Resolution : Please correct these errors and provide the requested documentation within 7 days of receipt of this letter. Failure to comply will leave me no choice but to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursue legal action to seek damages under the FCRA, Georgia law, and other applicable state and federal laws.

Conclusion : The continued reporting of these inaccuracies, failure to respond to my disputes, and the false reporting of my personal information have caused significant harm. I expect these issues to be addressed immediately, and I look forward to your prompt resolution of this matter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,30047,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11074343

Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation of Disputed Information : On XX/XX/year>, I filed a dispute with TransUnion regarding inaccuracies in my credit report. I explicitly requested a manual review of the disputed information due to its complexity. I provided clear supporting evidence, including highlighted copies of my credit report identifying the errors. However, XXXX used the E-Oscar system to process my dispute electronically rather than conducting the manual review I requested. This process fails to ensure a thorough investigation, as required under the FCRA. 
The response I received was vague and did not provide sufficient detail regarding the methods, sources, or procedures used to verify the disputed information. My specific questions about the investigation process remain unanswered. 
2. Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance by a Collection Agency : Account Name Account Number XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Despite my dispute, XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion continue to report this collection account without verifying its validity or requiring the collection agency to issue a 1099-C. This raises questions about the legitimacy of the debt and violates federal regulations. 
Key Violations : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : o XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) by failing to conduct a manual review of my dispute as explicitly requested. 
o The use of E-Oscar resulted in an inadequate and incomplete investigation. 
2. Failure to Provide Details of Investigation : o XXXX failed to provide the methods, sources, and documentation used in their investigation, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 4 ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ).

3. Inaccurate Reporting and Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance : o XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion continue to report inaccurate information, violating my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

o The collection agencys failure to issue a 1099-C for canceled or forgiven debt violates IRS regulations and raises concerns about the accounts validity.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,30134,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11074087

The first payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX, which I paid. The issue I have is that the company has not deducted my payments from the balance and it looks as if I have not made any payment on this car. I have been given extensions, and have been charged late payments even if I pay earlier in the month. 

I have been told that 11 payments were extended. I have asked for the extension paperwork which I have not received. Extensions were explained to me that they go on the back of the loan which extends the length of time that I pay for the car. 

My issue is that the balance owed is incorrect, which makes it look as if I am not paying for the car. When I looked at my XXXX credit report it states incorrectly that I have only made one payment, since XXXX, which is not correct and the car would have been repossessed. I need this corrected on my credit reports to reflect that I have been making payments which should decrease the balance. 

I am being contacted constantly by the company, but have not been able to speak to anyone higher than customer service to get this corrected. When I ask about the balance on the loan and why the payments are not being reported correctly as it should be going down, I am told about the daily interest, 11 extensions, late payments etc. That does not answer the questions I am asking.

So I then asked them to provide me a description of the investigation according to 15 usc 1681i ( 7 ) : ( 7 ) description of reinvestigation procedure. A consumer reporting agency shall provide to a consumer a description referred to in a paragraph ( 6 ) ( b ) ( iii ) by not later than 15 days after receiving a request from the consumer for that description.

But they did not do that as well either.

They also are breaking these laws as well below 15 usc 1681i ( 5 ) it states this ( 5 ) treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information ( A ) in general If, after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any information disputed by a consumer an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified the consumer reporting agency shall..

( I ) promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer or modify that item of information as appropriate based on the results of the reinvestigation and ( ii ) promptly notify the furnisher of that information that the information has been modified or deleted from the file of the consumer According to 15 usc 1681s-2 it states this ( A ) reporting information with actual knowledge of errors This is unfair and if they doing it to me imagine who else they are doing this too. Can please fix ( Method of verification/the process and procedure used to verify information/name and contact information of person contacted/any contracts bearing my wet signature ) IT TOOK LONGER THAN 30 days on my investigation therefore these items by law have to be deleted",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",AR,72032,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11064757

If this debt has been forgiven, canceled, or settled for less than the full balance, the IRS 1099-C form is required to be filed under 26 U.S.C. 6050P if the amount of canceled debt exceeds {$600.00}. 
In addition to the 1099-C form, I am disputing the accuracy of the debt and requesting verification in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Reinvestigation of Disputed Information ), and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information ) . I am entitled to request and receive complete documentation to verify the accuracy and legality of this account 's reporting, and I am invoking my rights under [ Mississippi ] law to receive proper validation of this debt. 
Written Communication Only : Please be advised that I am requesting written communication only regarding this matter. 
I do not wish to receive any phone calls or other forms of communication. Any correspondence should be directed to the address listed above. This request is made pursuant to my right under 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which entitles me to request that all communication from you be in writing. 
Requests for Documentation : 1. 1099-C Form : 2.

This form is required when the forgiven amount exceeds {$600.00}. If you have not filed this form, or if you can not provide it, I will assume that the debt has been discharged and should no longer be reported as owed on my credit report. Failure to file the 1099-C may constitute fraudulent reporting of the debt. 
3. Authenticated Double Entry Accounting Records : In addition to the 1099-C, I am requesting full double-entry accounting records for the account in question. This should include a detailed breakdown that shows all transactions, including the original balance, payments, interest, fees, and any other adjustments made to the account. Please ensure that the records comply with standard accounting practices, and provide authenticated evidence of the debt, rather than a simple list of charges or account statements. The court ruling in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX 
XXXX ), states that debt collectors must provide verified and authenticated documentation, not merely conclusory statements. 
4. Proof of Legal Right to Report and Collect the Debt : I also request authenticated evidence, in compliance with [ Your State ] law, that you have the legal right to report and collect this debt. This should include the original signed contract or agreement showing my obligation to pay the debt and your legal right to enforce collection and report it to the credit bureaus. In XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), the court held that creditors must provide original signed documentation to prove the validity of a debt. Failure to provide this evidence could result in violations of both state and federal consumer protection laws. 
Request for Deletion if Evidence is Not Provided : If you are unable to provide the requested documentation or proof of the debt, I request that you immediately delete this account from my credit report in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2.

It is important to note that this dispute was not sent by an unauthorized third party or "" credit clinic. '' I am writing to address several violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) that have occurred, which require your immediate attention and resolution.

I have the sole authority to determine what information should be considered private. I insist that my hard inquiries and account information not be shared on my credit report. 

FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Misleading False Reporting : The information you are reporting falsely suggests that I applied for multiple inquiries and accounts, when in reality, these were the result of a scammer 's actions. Such false reporting misleads future creditors. By reporting these unverified items, you violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and fail to comply with its fairness requirements.

FCRA Section 616 - Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : You accepted credit information about me without verifying its accuracy firsthand. This willful noncompliance is punishable by civil liability of up to {$1000.00} per violation.

FCRA Section 605B - Aggravated Identity Theft : You shared my personal information with numerous creditors without obtaining my consent, making you criminally liable for aggravated identity theft, which carries a penalty of up to 2 years of imprisonment.

FCRA Section 603 ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information : You failed to disclose my right to opt out of sharing my personal information. This omission was deceptive and a violation of my consumer rights. 
FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) - Furnishing Deceptive Forms : You furnished inaccurate inquiries and accounts without proper validation, potentially violating Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Reporting such inaccurate information is deceptive.

Violation of Debt Collection Practices Act : You engaged in unfair practices and harassment by reporting inaccurate debts and accounts without my consent, causing me distress and unnecessary contact from creditors. 

Violation of Identity Theft Laws : Creditors obtained my information without my true consent and used it to obtain credit from other financial institutions, constituting identity theft. 

Violation of Acquiring Location Information Regulations : Debt collectors contacted third-party credit reporting agencies with my information, stating that I owed a "" debt. '' This is a clear violation of regulations that prohibit disclosing debt information to third parties.

Violation of Timely Payments Regulations : You reported "" late payments '' on my credit report without defining what constitutes a late payment, which is deceptive and inaccurate.

Violation of Finance Charge Determination : You failed to accurately determine finance charges, which is your responsibility as a credit reporting agency.

Violation of Credit Report Permissible Purposes : You reported information on my credit report without obtaining my written consent, which is a violation of the permissible purposes outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : Complaint Against XXXX XXXX XXXX Compliance Department Regarding Improper Use of My Credit File To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX for violations of federal statutes related to the improper use of my credit file, reporting of information without consent, and failure to comply with legal obligations regarding debt reporting and income recognition.

1. Unauthorized Use and Reporting of Credit Information : XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which specifies permissible purposes for obtaining and using consumer credit reports. I never provided written consent for XXXX XXXX XXXX to report any information to my credit file. According to 16 CFR 313.7, financial institutions must obtain explicit authorization from consumers before sharing nonpublic personal information unless an exception applies, none of which are applicable here.

Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to do. Their actions also appear to violate 15 U.S.C. 6805, which empowers regulatory bodies to enforce these provisions.

2. Charge-Off Reporting and Misclassification : A charge-off is a bookkeeping designation used by creditors for tax purposes when they consider a debt uncollectible. Under federal tax law, a charge-off can be treated as a cancellation of debt, which may constitute income to the debtor. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX did not issue a XXXX ( Cancellation of Debt ) form to me, as required under IRS regulations XXXX to substantiate that the debt was canceled and classified as income. Without this form, their reporting of the charge-off to credit reporting agencies is not only improper but also misleading. 

Moreover, a charge-off does not represent a valid certificate of indebtedness. A certificate of indebtedness reflects a binding obligation that is enforceable ; a charge-off, by its nature, implies that the debt has been resolved or abandoned by the creditor. Reporting a charge-off to credit bureaus under these circumstances constitutes inaccurate reporting. 

XXXX. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : XXXX XXXX XXXX has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 68026805 ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ).

Additionally, I request clarification and appropriate remediation regarding : 1.The absence of a XXXX form to substantiate the charge-off as canceled debt. 
2.The improper classification of a charge-off as a certificate of indebtedness.

3.The unauthorized reporting of information to credit bureaus without my explicit written consent. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in ensuring compliance and protecting my rights as a consumer.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am filing this complaint against TransUnion for failing to validate and correct inaccuracies in my credit report regarding the following accounts : XXXX Account # XXXX XXXX  XXXX Account # XXXX Despite submitting disputes since XX/XX/XXXX, and providing clear evidence of inaccuracies, TransUnion has repeatedly closed my disputes, stating the accounts were verified as reported. However, no documentation or validation has been provided to support this claim. 

Specific Issues : Inconsistent and Impossible Dates : The XXXX account shows discrepancies in the Date of Last Activity and Closed Date. 
The XXXX XXXX account has a future reporting date ( XX/XX/XXXX ), which is impossible. 
Contradictory Payment Status : The XXXX account is marked Current but shows late payments, which is inaccurate and misleading. 
Missing Creditor Information : The original creditor for the XXXX account is not listed, violating my right to know the source of the information under FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ).

Failure to Validate : TransUnion has not provided any proof to substantiate these accounts, violating FCRA Section 611. 

Furthermore I have asked you to delete XXXX, XXXX, XXXX from my report as this is not my name and not correct. I have supplied you with my contact information, identification and the correct spelling of my name for six months but yet this still remains. REMOVE this as it is not my information. 
Repeated Disputes Ignored : I have disputed these accounts for six months, and no corrections or valid explanations have been provided. This is a clear violation of my rights under the FCRA. 
I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate TransUnions failure to comply with the FCRA and mandate the immediate deletion of these accounts from my credit report.

Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) 1 ( a ), I am demanding that your agency perform a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the status of the disputed information.

Pursuant to 15 USC 1681e ( b ) please complete this inaccurate account or delete it from my consumer reports.

The Law Cleary States : ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation required ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

I DO NOT consent to any E-OSCAR verification as this method is not reliable or lawful, according to the standards set for by the FCRA.

I am requesting that you validate the following items non-electronically, by performing a reasonable and FAIR re-investigation : Please provide the following details of the methods by which you verified these accounts : a. Identity and position of the representative contacted?

b. Date, duration, and substance of the conversation?

c. Contact details utilized?

d. Identity, position, and tenure of your company 's employees involved?

e. Details of formal training imparted to said employee?

f. Copies of all written correspondence?

Your agency also seems to be in violation of non-compliance and negligent non-compliance with being in direct violation or the following laws : 15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance ( a ) In general Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) ( A ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than {$100.00} and not more than {$1000.00} ; or ( B ) in the case of liability of a natural person for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose, actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater ; ( 2 ) such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow ; and ( 3 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.

( b ) Civil liability for knowing noncompliance Any person who obtains a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose shall be liable to the consumer reporting agency for actual damages sustained by the consumer reporting agency or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater.

These are now multiple attempts to handle this matter privately. If these accounts keep getting verified by a faulty e-Oscar system when I know these accounts are erroneous and destroying my credit worthiness, I will in fact sue your agency for the maximum monetary damages that the FCRA allows. 

Your agency has less than 30 days to respond with a fair reasonable re-investigation or I will have no choice but to seek legal action. This investigation must be validated by the information that I have listed above. If the information is not validated, then it must be deleted immediately from my consumer report!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,33321,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11064392

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/year> Subject : Complaint Against XXXX XXXX XXXX Regarding Improper Use of My Credit File To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX for violations of federal statutes related to the improper use of my credit file, reporting of information without consent, and failure to comply with legal obligations regarding debt reporting and income recognition.

1. Unauthorized Use and Reporting of Credit Information : XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which specifies permissible purposes for obtaining and using consumer credit reports. I never provided written consent for XXXX XXXX XXXX to report any information to my credit file. 
According to 16 CFR 313.7, financial institutions must obtain explicit authorization from consumers before sharing nonpublic personal information unless an exception applies, none of which are applicable here. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX failed to do. Their actions also appear to violate 15 U.S.C. 6805, which empowers regulatory bodies to enforce these provisions.

2. Charge-Off Reporting and Misclassification : A charge-off is a bookkeeping designation used by creditors for tax purposes when they consider a debt uncollectible. Under federal tax law, a charge-off can be treated as a cancellation of debt, which may constitute income to the debtor. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX did not issue a 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) form to me, as required under IRS regulations , to substantiate that the debt was canceled and classified as income. Without this form, their reporting of the charge-off to credit reporting agencies is not only improper but also misleading.

Moreover, a charge-off does not represent a valid certificate of indebtedness. A certificate of indebtedness reflects a binding obligation that is enforceable ; a charge-off, by its nature, implies that the debt has been resolved or abandoned by the creditor. Reporting a charge-off to credit bureaus under these circumstances constitutes inaccurate reporting.

3. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : XXXX XXXX XXXX has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. XXXX ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ). Additionally, I request clarification and appropriate remediation regarding : 1. The absence of a 1099-C form to substantiate the charge-off as canceled debt.

2. The improper classification of a charge-off as a certificate of indebtedness.

3. The unauthorized reporting of information to credit bureaus without my explicit written consent. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in ensuring compliance and protecting my rights as a consumer.

XXXX XXXX Subject : Urgent Demand for Removal of Unauthorized Accounts and Violations of Federal Law Equifax has demonstrated a clear failure to maintain consistency and transparency in its handling of your dispute, further compounding the harm caused by its already unlawful practices. On one hand, Equifax sent written correspondence stating that your disputes were deemed frivolous because they were previously verified or lacked new relevant information. Yet, when you called Equifaxs representatives, they contradicted this claim by asserting that the FTC report you submitted, along with other supporting documents, was invalid or not reflected in their system. This blatant inconsistency in communication highlights systemic negligence, internal disorganization, and possibly intentional efforts to delay or obstruct dispute resolution. 

Key Issues with Equifaxs Contradictions 1. Misleading Written Statements : The letter implied that your disputes were frivolous, suggesting there was no new information to warrant further investigation. However, the supporting documentation you submitted, including proof of identification, proof of address, and the FTC Identity Theft Report, satisfies the requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 for blocking disputed items. 
2. Disregard of Submitted Documents : Equifaxs claim during your phone call that the FTC report was invalid reflects either a failure to properly process submitted documents or intentional misrepresentation of its obligations under federal law. 
3. Obstruction of Consumer Rights : The conflicting statements prevent you from effectively resolving the dispute and exercising your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). By sending contradictory information, Equifax undermines its obligation to provide a clear and efficient dispute resolution process. 
4. Possible Profit-Driven Motives : The delays caused by these contradictory statements may be a tactic to continue profiting from unauthorized or inaccurate information on your credit report, as credit reporting agencies often benefit financially from retaining more data on consumers. 
5. Violation of FCRA Procedures : According to 15 U.S.C. 1681i, Equifax must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information and can not arbitrarily declare disputes frivolous, especially when documentation is provided. 

Legal and Regulatory Implications 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Equifax must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information on your credit report. Failing to process valid disputes and providing contradictory information violates this mandate. 
15 U.S.C. 1681n : Willful noncompliance with the FCRA exposes Equifax to statutory, actual, and punitive damages. 
Section 5 ( a ) of the FTC Act : Misleading consumers through contradictory communication may constitute unfair and deceptive practices, subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 
Consumer Financial Protection Act ( 12 U.S.C. 5536 ) : Equifaxs actions may violate the prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ). 

Demand for Accountability Equifaxs inability to provide consistent and accurate information underscores a broader systemic failure within its dispute resolution processes. I will not tolerate the continued violation of my rights. Your contradictory communications must be resolved, and the following actions must be taken immediately : 1. Remove all unauthorized accounts and information in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2.

2. Provide a written explanation reconciling the discrepancies between your written and verbal statements.

3. Implement internal compliance measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future. 





To Whom It May Concern, This formal complaint demands the immediate removal of unauthorized accounts and inaccurate information from my consumer report. Despite my compliance with all legal requirements under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( Section 605C2 ), these accounts remain unlawfully reported. Furthermore, I have IRS-confirmed evidence of Form 1099-C cancellation for the debts associated with these accounts, proving they are no longer valid or collectible. 
The fact that these canceled accounts remain on my report, despite their resolution with the IRS, demonstrates not only your noncompliance with federal law but also a potential fraudulent financial intent. If these items are not promptly removed, I reserve the right to report your continued actions to the IRS under their whistleblower program, as the profit gained from unauthorized reporting constitutes tax fraud and abuse. 
Accounts to Be Removed Immediately XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Violations of Federal Law and Additional Actions : 1. FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 : All disputed information must be blocked within four ( 4 ) business days upon submission of proper documentation. Despite fulfilling all requirements, including FTC Identity Theft Report, identification, and proof of address, these accounts remain unblocked.

2. IRS Reporting Requirements : The debts associated with the accounts above have been canceled via Form 1099-C and accepted by the IRS. Continuing to report these accounts as valid debts constitutes a misrepresentation of their status. Additionally, this behavior indicates potential violations of tax laws if these debts are used for financial gain or inaccurate reporting purposes.

3. Fraudulent Intent and Misrepresentation : By retaining and profiting from inaccurate and unauthorized information, your actions may violate 18 U.S.C. 1962 ( RICO ) and 18 U.S.C. 894 ( Extortionate Credit Practices ).

4. Whistleblower and Audit Risk : If this noncompliance persists, I will report your activities to the IRS for further investigation and audit. The whistleblower program rewards accurate reporting of tax fraud and abuse, which includes the exploitation of consumer data for monetary gain.

5. Breach of Consumer Rights : Your failure to remove canceled debts constitutes ongoing harm to my financial reputation, with severe consequences for your compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681b and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act protections. 
Immediate Demands : 1. Immediate Removal of All Accounts Listed : All canceled debts and unauthorized accounts must be removed from my credit report within seven ( 7 ) business days of receiving this notice.

2. Written Confirmation of Compliance : Provide written confirmation that these accounts have been permanently removed and will not be re-reported.

3. IRS Whistleblower Avoidance : Take corrective action immediately to avoid being reported for fraudulent financial practices and unauthorized profit from canceled debts. 
Conclusion : Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX continued failure to comply with federal law is a direct attack on my financial stability and consumer rights. I have met all requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, and the additional inclusion of 1099-C evidence further cements that these accounts have no basis for continued reporting. 
This is your final opportunity to resolve this matter. Failure to comply will result in further escalations, including filing whistleblower complaints with the IRS and pursuing legal remedies for damages under the FCRA, CFPB regulations, and RICO statutes.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33993,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11071986

I have been given extensions, and have been charged late payments even if I pay earlier in the month. 

I have been told that 11 payments were extended. I have asked for the extension paperwork which I have not received. Extensions were explained to me that they go on the back of the loan which extends the length of time that I pay for the car. 

My issue is that the balance owed is incorrect, which makes it look as if I am not paying for the car. When I looked at my Equifax credit report it states incorrectly that I have only made one payment, since XXXX, which is not correct and the car would have been repossessed. I need this corrected on my credit reports to reflect that I have been making payments which should decrease the balance. 

I am being contacted constantly by the company, but have not been able to speak to anyone higher than customer service to get this corrected. When I ask about the balance on the loan and why the payments are not being reported correctly as it should be going down, I am told about the daily interest, 11 extensions, late payments etc. That does not answer the questions I am asking.

Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Disputed Information : Inaccuracies, account number is reported as incomplete, date of last activity, balance Owed, and creditor type. 

Under Section 611 of the FCRA, I have the right to dispute inaccuracies and request prompt investigation. I formally requested a reinvestigation of the account information and cited relevant sections of the FCRA, includi

ng : 1. Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Requirement for verification of accounts through original documentation. 2. Section 611 : Right to dispute inaccuracies and request investigation. 3. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) : Removal of unv
erifiable information dont validated for creditor Original.

4. 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires that the procedures for including information in credit reports ensure maximum possible accuracy Despite my request, EQUIFAX has failed to conduct a thorough investigation or resolve these discrepancies within the required timeframe of 30 days. This negligence has led to the continued reporting of false information, which has negatively impacted on my creditworthiness. 
In my request, I emphasized that any unverifiable information should be removed from my credit report INMEDEDIATLY within the mandated 30-day period, as established in 15 U.S. Code 1681i. Additionally, I referenced 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires that the procedures for including information in credit reports ensure maximum possible accuracy.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Dear CFPB, I am filing this complaint regarding serious inaccuracies in the reporting of my account with XXXX XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) ** by XXXX and Equifax . Specifically, this account falsely reflects late payments in XXXX and XXXX of last year, along with inconsistencies in the reporting details across both credit bureaus. I have taken screenshots documenting these discrepancies as evidence. 

The reporting practices of XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus violate several provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and related U.S. laws. I demand immediate action to address and rectify these violations.

Violations of Federal Law 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports Credit reporting agencies are required to maintain and report accurate consumer information. The blatant inconsistencies and inaccuracies in this case demonstrate a failure to uphold this obligation, resulting in harm to my creditworthiness.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) Dispute Resolution Obligations Upon disputing inaccuracies, credit bureaus must conduct a timely and reasonable investigation. Past attempts to resolve this matter have been ignored or mishandled, failing to meet legal standards for a proper investigation.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Furnisher Responsibility to Report Accurate Information XXXX XXXX , as a furnisher of information, is prohibited from reporting information it knows or should reasonably know to be inaccurate. False late payments violate this provision.

15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) Obsolete Information The inclusion of unverifiable or false late payments contravenes the mandate to exclude inaccurate or outdated information.

15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) Permissible Purposes for Reporting Consumer Information Reporting entities must comply with permissible purposes and ensure consumer data is not misrepresented or mishandled. XXXX XXXX false and conflicting data breaches this obligation. 

Impact of Violations The inaccurate late payments have adversely affected my credit score, jeopardizing my ability to obtain credit on fair terms. This financial and emotional harm is a direct result of negligent and unlawful reporting practices. The FCRA provides consumers with protection against such actions, yet XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax have collectively failed to comply. 

My Requests Immediate Removal of Late Payments : Remove the false late payments reported for XXXX and XXXX of last year from my credit reports. 
Corrections Across All Bureaus : Ensure that my account is accurately reflected across all reporting agencies.

Full Investigation : Conduct a thorough investigation into XXXX XXXX reporting practices and ensure compliance with FCRA standards.

Written Confirmation : Provide written confirmation of receipt of this dispute and resolution updates.

Evidence Provided I have attached screenshots of the inconsistent and inaccurate reporting for your review.

I urge the CFPB to address this matter promptly. The continued disregard for federal law by XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus demands immediate accountability. I trust that the CFPB will ensure my rights under the FCRA and related statutes are protected.

These inaccuracies, reflected by both XXXX and Equifax, include false reports of late payments and conflicting information, which violate multiple provisions of U.S. law. 

The accounts in question are : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Equifax XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, Equifax ) Violations of Federal Law The reporting by these entities violates several provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and related laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports Credit reporting agencies are legally obligated to ensure that consumer information is accurate.

Key Issues and Violations : Failure to Provide Validation : Despite multiple requests, Equifax has not provided any proof that these accounts belong to me, violating my rights under FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ).

Inconsistent and Contradictory Reporting : The XXXX account is marked as Current but shows late payments, which is contradictory. The late payments make absolutely no logical sense ( attached ) The XXXX XXXX XXXX account has inconsistent high balances and a future reporting date ( XX/XX/2024 ), which is impossible. 
Inaccurate Dates and Balances : The dates of last activity and reported balances vary between bureaus, violating FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ), which mandates accurate reporting.

Failure to Delete Unverified Information : Under FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ), if Equifax can not verify these accounts, they are required to delete them. Their failure to do so is a clear violation.

I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate XXXX failure to comply with the FCRA and mandate the immediate deletion of these accounts from my credit report.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To : XXXX, Equifax and XXXX I am writing to formally address the ongoing inaccuracies and reporting violations on my credit reports. Despite my previous attempts to resolve these issues, the inaccurate information remains, and the credit bureaus have failed to respond appropriately. The continued inaction and false reporting of my personal information are direct violations of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other applicable federal and state laws. 

Accounts to be Corrected : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) The inaccurate information reported by XXXX on my credit report, including incorrect account status, balances, or any other erroneous reporting, must be corrected. If this account has been reported as open or active while it is closed, or if there are any discrepancies with the dates and balance reported, this must be corrected immediately. 

XXXX XXXX  Similarly XXXX XXXX XXXX  has reported inaccurate information on my credit file. This includes any incorrect account status or outstanding balances that do not reflect the actual state of the account. The account status, dates, and balances reported by XXXX XXXX  must be verified and corrected immediately. 

Unauthorized Hard Inquiries Additionally, I have noticed multiple unauthorized hard inquiries that were made to my credit report without my consent. According to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( c ), no one may obtain a credit report or perform a hard inquiry without my written consent. These inquiries need to be removed immediately as they were made in violation of my rights under the FCRA.

Legal Violations : Failure to Correct Inaccurate Information - 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( e ) : Under 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( e ), you are required to investigate and correct any inaccuracies in my credit report upon receiving a dispute. Despite my prior notifications, the inaccuracies remain uncorrected, violating this provision.

Failure to Provide Results of Investigation - 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( i ) : 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( i ) mandates that you conduct a reasonable investigation upon receiving notice of a dispute and provide the results of that investigation. The continued reporting of false information after I have disputed it is a violation of this statute.

Violation of Consumer Protection Laws- HJR 192, REMED, 1099C & 1099A : The HJR 192 REMED resolution and the 1099C and 1099A guidelines require that if a debt is written off or canceled, it must be reported as such, and a 1099-C form should be issued. I have never received such documentation, and the reporting of this debt as active is a clear violation of these rules.

Failure to Remove Inaccurate Information - FCRA Section 611 ( AX1 ) and FCRA Section 605 ( c ) : FCRA Section 611 ( AX1 ) requires the removal of inaccurate or unverifiable information upon investigation. Furthermore, FCRA Section 605 ( c ) restricts the reporting of certain negative information beyond a specific timeframe, and your continued reporting of this account is in violation of this limitation.

Right to Rescind Credit Transactions- 15 U.S. Code 1635 : According to 15 U.S. Code 1635, I have the right to rescind credit transactions under specific circumstances. The continued erroneous reporting of my credit history disregards this right, particularly regarding debts that may be canceled or rescinded.

Debt Collection Violations- 15 U.S. Code 1692 : Under 15 U.S. Code 1692, debt collectors are prohibited from reporting false or misleading information to credit reporting agencies. The account being reported on my credit file is inaccurate, and there has been no action taken to rectify this violation.

Errors in Credit Report : I find that the following information provided on my credit report is an error. This account was never late or owed any amount ( pursuant to HJR 192 REMED ). You are alleging that I owe a debt without furnishing any proof of this debt, including a full accounting ledger or proof of any 1099s that were filed on behalf of my principal. You have failed to demonstrate that you have followed all relevant laws and regulations for reporting this debt.

Therefore, you must remove this account from my credit report immediately.

It is against the law to report any information that has not been proven accurate. Under Georgia law, including provisions found in Georgia Code Title 7 - Banking and Finance, and under relevant statutes such as Georgias Fair Business Practices Act ( FBPA ), a deficiency claim can not be asserted unless all required notices were properly and timely given, and all allowable redemption and cure time limits were adhered to.

Additionally, as outlined in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are required to adhere to the following provisions : 15 U.S.C. 1692a ( 1-7 ) : Definitions and regulations governing what constitutes fair and unfair practices in debt collection.

15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 1-12 ) : Prohibits false or misleading representations in connection with debt collection.

15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a-c ) : Requires validation of debts upon request, including the provision of evidence supporting any alleged debt.

15 U.S.C. 1666 : Governs billing errors and prohibits creditors from imposing unauthorized fees.

15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) : Requires accurate reporting of information and protection of consumer privacy. 

Supreme Court Cases : XXXX XXXX XXXX. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190 ( 2021 ) : The U.S. Supreme Court XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ramirez emphasized that a consumer reporting agency must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information it provides to others. If the information being reported is inaccurate, the consumer has the right to dispute and seek correction. This case reinforces my right to challenge and have corrected any inaccuracies that are being reported about my credit file.

Spokeo , Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540 ( 2016 ) : In Spokeo v. Robins, the Supreme Court held that a consumer must demonstrate a concrete injury in order to bring a claim under the FCRA. The Court made it clear that when a consumer 's personal information is misused, especially in ways that can harm their financial reputation, they are entitled to seek legal remedies. The inaccurate reporting and unauthorized hard inquiries on my credit report have caused harm, and I am entitled to seek remedies under these precedents.

Consequences of Non-Compliance : The alleged claim of a deficiency is null and void, and any continued collection activities or reporting of this invalid claim on my credit reports will be considered a violation of the FDCPA and FCRA.

If you fail to comply with the above requests, I reserve all rights to seek damages against all parties involved under applicable state, federal, and Georgia-specific remedies.

Legal Demand : Under the FCRA and Georgia law, you are required by law to ensure the accuracy of all information reported. The continued failure to correct these inaccuracies despite repeated notifications is a direct violation of federal consumer protection laws. 

In addition to correcting the inaccuracies, I am entitled to damages under the FCRA, including actual damages, punitive damages up to {$1000.00}, and attorney fees. Moreover, I am entitled to damages for XXXX XXXX  in the amount of {$10000.00} due to the ongoing distress caused by the inaccurate reporting and the misuse of my personal information. 

Total Damages : Actual Damages : To be determined based on the impact this has had on my financial health. 

Punitive Damages : Up to {$1000.00} under the FCRA. 
Attorney Fees : To be determined. 
XXXX XXXX : {$10000.00} each for emotional distress caused by the continued reporting of inaccurate information, unauthorized use of my data, and the failure to correct these errors. 

Risk of Further Legal Claims : As a data furnishing company involved in the buying, selling, transferring, and securitizing accounts and personal information, you are privately profiting off my personal information. This practice not only increases the risk of data breaches but also raises concerns about identity theft. 

These activities expose you to the potential for legal claims due to mishandling consumer data and may place you at significant risk for further legal consequences. I want to make it clear that continuing these practices could expose you to claims related to past data breaches, identity theft, and violations of consumer protection laws.

If this situation is not resolved promptly, you may face additional claims for damages resulting from these violations.

Corrective Action Required : Immediate Removal of the inaccurate information from my credit reports, including the incorrect account status, dates, and balances on all three credit bureaus.

Verification of Debt : Provide proof that the reported debt is accurate, and if it is a written-off account, issue a 1099-C form as required.

Investigation Results : Provide written confirmation that a reasonable investigation has been conducted, and include the results of the investigation and any corrective actions taken.

Removal of Unauthorized Hard Inquiries : All unauthorized hard inquiries on my credit report must be immediately removed, as they were made without my written consent.

Deadline for Resolution : Please correct these errors and provide the requested documentation within 7 days of receipt of this letter. Failure to comply will leave me no choice but to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and pursue legal action to seek damages under the FCRA, Georgia law, and other applicable state and federal laws. 

Conclusion : The continued reporting of these inaccuracies, failure to respond to my disputes, and the false reporting of my personal information have caused significant harm.

I have XXXX $ in there that they have locked from me that is mine for some unknown reason. Originally it said once I turned in documents that the next day it would unlock my account. So I uploaded the documents that very day. 

Friday the XXXX of XXXX comes and it says they are reviewing my docs I submitted and they would get back to me on XX/XX/year>. 

So I waited then on the XXXX it said the second and on the second it said the third and it has just kept pushing back the review date and they havent let me access my own money. 

I called Robinhood and they make it so difficult to get a hold of the. I got in a queue for them to call my about my issue. They call me XX/XX/XXXX and ask me what the inquiry was about. I explained to them my account has been frozen and that the day my docs are supposed to be review the date just keep getting pushed back. 

Then she started asking me about crypto transfers I have been making and if I plan on making more transfers in the future. I answered all the questions and then they said that they would review the info and get back to me. Well since that Wednesday it still says they are in the process of reviewing everything but I turned in my necessary docs a long time ago and they are just holding money that is mine and not letting me withdraw it.

2024-12-08,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Fraud or scam,,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a Robinhood account. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX i made three instant deposits/transfers from my checking accounts to my Robinhood account totaling {$1300.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to do make an instant transfer of {$1000.00} to my XXXX account and it didn't show on my available balance on XXXX. I tried to make several more attempts and they never showed up available as purchasing power. Worried that I did something wrong, I looked at my history and it had them as deposits, not instant deposits and they were set to be available in 4-5 days. I cancelled all but one of those deposits and left one {$1000.00} deposit that was set to be available out in 4-5 days. When I got home later in the day, I did some reading on why the instant deposits were not available. In my reading I found that only {$2000.00} were available for instant deposits in the beginning. I then understood that I could use my debit card for instant deposits from then forward. So, I entered my debit card, provided my ID and set of live selfies when prompted. My debit card was then authorized, and I used it to deposit another {$1000.00} into my Robinhood account. Shortly after I purchased another {$250.00} of crypto. After that I turned on two factor authorization using my phone for more protection. Around, XXXX I set up XXXX transfers on the Robinhood app. Around XXXX I sent a small amount of crypto to my secure storage/wallet to make sure there were no hiccups. Shortly after that I attempted to transfer the remainder of my crypto at the time to the same storage wallet. It was declined and within 5 mins my account was restricted. I can genuinely state that I am thankful for security. However, what Robinhood is doing now is nothing less than fraud. When the account was restricted, it asked for a copy of my ID and three more live selfies. I promptly provided the documentation. I received a message on the app stating that Robinhood would review the documents and get back with me by XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the date was changed to XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX it was changed to XX/XX/XXXX and so on. I will provide screenshots of this showing the XXXX giving an example. Every time I attempt to contact support it gives a message to take action. Then at the bottom there is only one response available, "" Yes, that's all ''. This is the response i have gotten every day since XX/XX/XXXX, what a joke? I have attempted to request a call back, Robinhoods support system stated it did not recognize my telephone number. I will provide a screen shot of me using two factor authorization and them using my telephone number showing that there is no reason to claim they don't recognize the number. I have reached out on XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  to their support bot, that's been no help. I have received four emails with case numbers ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ), when I call the provided number ( XXXX ) in the email, it states they can not verify the case numbers. I have screenshots from the Help bot stating they will call. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a pop-up text stating that Robinhood had attempted to call me. My phone had never rung, and my call log will prove that through my telephone service provider. I checked my email, and I received an email at XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that Robinhood noticed some unusual activity on my account and tried to call me on XX/XX/XXXX, it gave instructions on how to request a call through the app. I have attempted to do exactly as instructed and there is no option to request a call with their instructions given. On the app and there was a message for me to request a call. When I tap the request a call area it does absolutely nothing. Look Robinhood has had my info for over a week, they have received no less than three copies of my ID both front and back as well as 5 sets of live selfies though the app and computer. They are giving me the run around and I know that this isn't the only occurrence. There are people on social media talking about it. If any other emails, screenshots, records are needed, please let me know. After recently researching Robinhoods past they are known to do shady stuff and are not consumer friendly at all. There is no live or even live email support. I've lost opportunity and money as a result of their actions. I am just thankful that it wasn't a huge sum of money tied up with them and can wait them out to do the right thing. Either by choice or through the legal system as I am filing a complaint with my State AG this week as well. The fact that I am offering copies of all correspondence, screenshots, and making a complaint through a GOVERNMENT WEBSITE should state that I am who I say I am and have nothing to hide. I have yet to be told why my account is restricted other than unusual activity. I am inclined to say it was my attempt to transfer my crypto out of Robinhood. Or it may be that i cancelled some deposits and used my debit card. Again, their communication is leading me to believe that something illegal or shady is going on with Robinhood as I am reading similar occurrences happening more and more and this no communication game is their MO.",,ROBINHOOD MARKETS INC.,MO,652XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11074861

Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation of Disputed Information : On XX/XX/2024, I filed a dispute with XXXX regarding inaccuracies in my credit report. I explicitly requested a manual review of the disputed information due to its complexity. I provided clear supporting evidence, including highlighted copies of my credit report identifying the errors. However, XXXX used the E-Oscar system to process my dispute electronically rather than conducting the manual review I requested. This process fails to ensure a thorough investigation, as required under the FCRA. 
The response I received was vague and did not provide sufficient detail regarding the methods, sources, or procedures used to verify the disputed information. My specific questions about the investigation process remain unanswered.

Despite my dispute, XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX continue to report this collection account without verifying its validity or requiring the collection agency to issue a 1099-C.

Key Violations : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : o XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) by failing to conduct a manual review of my dispute as explicitly requested.

o The use of E-Oscar resulted in an inadequate and incomplete investigation.

2. Failure to Provide Details of Investigation : o XXXX failed to provide the methods, sources, and documentation used in their investigation, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 4 ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ).

3. Inaccurate Reporting and Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance : o XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX continue to report inaccurate information, violating my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

o The collection agencys failure to issue a 1099-C for canceled or forgiven debt violates IRS regulations and raises concerns about the accounts validity.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30134,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11076690

2024-12-08,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Other service problem,,"This complaint is directly focused on Robinhoods unacceptable customer support practices. The company is unable to handle support tickets, as evidenced by two of my most recent interactions with them. After a disruption of my ability to trade cryptocurrencies on Robinhood, I opened a chat with their customer support. As seen on the attached transcript, the company notified me at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX that their service support team is experiencing longer than normal wait times, encouraging me to cancel my case. I continued receiving the same message through XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX at which point an agent joined the chat and proceeded to close it due to a lack of response on my end ( given that it was 10 hours after my initial message and, considering the time of day, I did not see their note until later that morning ). 

Given the importance of their platform for financial transactions, not having functional support is unacceptable and can potentially cost customers significant losses. Robinhoods inability to address critical issues promptly undermines user confidence and poses a serious risk to its customers. I urge the CFPB to investigate these deficiencies to prevent further harm to consumers and to compel Robinhood to strengthen its customer support practices to address the deplorable level of service they are currently providing.",,ROBINHOOD MARKETS INC.,MA,022XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11076348

I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it weren't for an oversight, l 'd have an excellent repayment record. I made a mistake in falling behind, but since then, I have diligently paid on my account. Since then, l 've had a spotless record of on-time payments. 
My wife and I are planning to apply for a mortgage, and it's come to my attention that the missed payments on my record could hurt my ability to qualify. I truly believe that it doesn't reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts. It would help me immensely if you could give me a second chance and make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payments. 
Thank you for your consideration, and I hope you'll approve my request.

I have evidence that this XXXX used predatory lending. Tactics to lure me into giving them all kinds of financial information that considering bthey have a reputation I wish I would have found out before but now that I know why their earnings are gettting according to their is because all the people just as XXXX XXXX are being told to get the not only all my bank information and making me not use debit card alone but why both and forced me in order to get my contract finished and I really need transportation I had doubts that a large corporation trusted to manage so much money had misrepresented themselves after the etf cleared my account and several attempts of putting all my bank info and more info I gave them then when I bought my home. I didnt not feel right but they have you sign telling you that they will not make any transaction in the account I which they took my funds that were not in their which could have been bouncing all my other financial obligation and they only use etf because banks will not reverse them or return them. They did not care what I had in the bamk. My financial information is definitely in jeopar and for once I love XXXX XXXX. They kept removing documents lying and saying that I missed the deadline putting paper work in. They ran my credit. I never signed a line or permission for them to put a hard inquiry on my credit. I went on the usiness bureau abd they have done to so many consumers and allowed to do so like we have no regulations at all. Im terrified snd my dog needs medical care. He may need e XXXX  and they stole my down payment and wont freturn my calls or emai, in which one letter informed them that I am see, ing legal action. In the meantime their earning sky rocketed. Of course your money you have stolen from your customers down payments are being used for Ilegal financial gain an if you please go to the XXXX XXXX XXXX your going to read thousands of recent identical complaints that people just feel no recourse to let them act like XXXX. Please help and please I beg you to stop them from laundering money of low income cand badly damaged consumers with low credit scores that fir a predatory demographic to target and I never seen a company lying and cheating with consumers lost and stolen car down payments taken by them and jeopardizing their identity and financials. Please help bring justice. They have done other illegal things. Yesterday the ceo bragged indignantly about all the things about them that were flat out lies. I really would like my down payment returned immediately and after your investigation that I hope you dont let slip threw the crack they owe millions of consumer fraud dollars are destroying the hopes and causing pain, emotional, and final damage with unethical, and illegal activity to pull themselves out of near bankruptcy by destroying peoples lives. Please please read the XXXX XXXX XXXX complaints. My money as a down payment will never be returned because none of the complaintees down payments were returned they let me belie I was being sold a car and they had waited so desperate for the electric transfer to hit their bank then after feeling violated already. They have my debit card and bank info they proceed to tell me deal is off. They never brought up my down payment refund because they dont believe they have to and dont believe that I will suit them. I have already been looking for a consumer lawyer and XXXX represented another XXXX of their victims. I dont have the emotional capacity and unlike them I just want the down payment XXXX $ returned for the sake of moving on but if o sue them I can and will take so much more money and eventually a class action will destroy Them. Not interested in destroying anything. I just want to feel not so disgusting taken advantage and violetec with out my down payment I need because someone else who is not doing strange things offered financing and o cant give them the money. Ive spent more my dog who had very late stage XXXX and now I will probably end up barely making it until my railroad retirement XXXX check hits my bank on XXXX.

Previous Dispute Submitted to Equifax : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  CFPB Case Number : XXXX Equifax recently closed my dispute without blocking the fraudulent late payment. This violates FCRA 605B, which mandates that fraudulent information be blocked from a consumer 's credit report within four business days of receiving proper documentation. 

I am a victim of identity theft and the Equifax data breach. The fraudulent late payment pertains to an auto loan opened at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, under account number XXXX. It was reported as delinquent in XX/XX/XXXX. I do not recognize this late payment or the account and have provided substantial evidence supporting my claim, including : A valid identity theft affidavit ( FTC Identity Theft Criminal Complaint # XXXX ) Proof of address A copy of my government-issued identification Documentation linking me to the Equifax data breach Despite receiving this evidence, Equifax failed to block the disputed items within the four business days required by FCRA 605B . Instead, they "" verified '' the fraudulent accounts without disclosing the sources or evidence used, violating FCRA 611. 

Equifax has not blocked the fraudulent late payment from my credit file, as required under 605B of the FCRA. This non-compliance is particularly egregious given that I am a known victim of the Equifax data breach. 

Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation ( FCRA 611 ) Equifax 's investigation did not meet the standards outlined in 611. They failed to provide details of their verification process, including the sources and furnishers contacted. This lack of transparency undermines my right to accurate credit reporting.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NH,030XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11076954

I received the results and noticed that they did not fix nothing. There are breaking FEDERAL LAW!

According to 15usc 1681e ( b ) it states this ( b ) accuracy of report Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedure to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 
So I then asked them to provide me a description of the investigation according to 15 usc 1681i ( 7 ) : ( 7 ) description of reinvestigation procedure. A consumer reporting agency shall provide to a consumer a description referred to in a paragraph ( 6 ) ( b ) ( iii ) by not later than 15 days after receiving a request from the consumer for that description.

But they did not do that as well either.

They also are breaking these laws as well below 15 usc 1681i ( 5 ) it states this ( 5 ) treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information ( A ) in general If, after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any information disputed by a consumer an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified the consumer reporting agency shall.. 
( I ) promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer or modify that item of information as appropriate based on the results of the reinvestigation and ( ii ) promptly notify the furnisher of that information that the information has been modified or deleted from the file of the consumer According to 15 usc 1681s-2 it states this ( A ) reporting information with actual knowledge of errors This is unfair and if they doing it to me imagine who else they are doing this too. Can please fix ( Method of verification/the process and procedure used to verify information/name and contact information of person contacted/any contracts bearing my wet signature ) IT TOOK LONGER THAN 30 days on my investigation therefore these items by law have to be deleted",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",AR,72032,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11065478

Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) states that a consumer reporting agency can not furnish account information without my explicit written instructions, which I have not provided. Furthermore, per 15 U.S.C. 1681a paragraph ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ), transactions improperly reported that do not meet consumer reporting standards should be excluded from my consumer report. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1666b, a creditor may not treat payments on a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose unless proper notice is mailed to the consumer at least 21 days before the due date. To my knowledge, I did not receive any such notice or statement. Lastly, 15 U.S.C. 1637b requires that creditors provide clear and timely disclosures of payment terms, which I did not receive in relation to this account.

Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) 1 ( a ), I am demanding that your agency perform a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the status of the disputed information.

Pursuant to 15 USC 1681e ( b ) please complete this inaccurate account or delete it from my consumer reports.

The Law Cleary States : ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation required ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

I DO NOT consent to any E-OSCAR verification as this method is not reliable or lawful, according to the standards set for by the FCRA.

I am requesting that you validate the following items non-electronically, by performing a reasonable and FAIR re-investigation : Please provide the following details of the methods by which you verified these accounts : a. Identity and position of the representative contacted?

b. Date, duration, and substance of the conversation?

c. Contact details utilized?

d. Identity, position, and tenure of your company 's employees involved?

e. Details of formal training imparted to said employee?

f. Copies of all written correspondence?

Your agency also seems to be in violation of non-compliance and negligent non-compliance with being in direct violation or the following laws : 15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance ( a ) In general Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) ( A ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than {$100.00} and not more than {$1000.00} ; or ( B ) in the case of liability of a natural person for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose, actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater ; ( 2 ) such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow ; and ( 3 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court. 
( b ) Civil liability for knowing noncompliance Any person who obtains a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose shall be liable to the consumer reporting agency for actual damages sustained by the consumer reporting agency or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater. 

These are now multiple attempts to handle this matter privately. If these accounts keep getting verified by a faulty e-Oscar system when I know these accounts are erroneous and destroying my credit worthiness, I will in fact sue your agency for the maximum monetary damages that the FCRA allows. 

Your agency has less than 30 days to respond with a fair reasonable re-investigation or I will have no choice but to seek legal action. This investigation must be validated by the information that I have listed above. If the information is not validated, then it must be deleted immediately from my consumer report!",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33321,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11065413

Then, I asked for a method of verification letter which they were required to respond to within 15 days and they failed to do so. They reinserted it on my credit report that it had been verified through XXXX XXXX and the bankruptcy courts, but that was simply not true. XXXX XXXX, nor the bankruptcy courts verify public records with Equifax, XXXX, or XXXX. The record has been removed from XXXX XXXX and since Equifax claimed that it was verified through them, it wasn't, then Equifax has to remove it immediately. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has ruled that section 349 of the bankruptcy code was intended to UNDUE the bankruptcy and to restore BOTH parties to pre-petition financial status. How does a PRIVATE company like Equifax think that it's okay to override the highest court in the United States of America? I can't dispute anything with Equifax because they repeatedly send me letters stating that my ID was not clear, even though it obviously is, because all the other bureaus accepted it, and it was sent at the same time. I feel like this is a worn-out stall tactic that Equifax uses in order REQUIR to evade the law. I'm wondering if they will come up with that same excuse now. EQUIFAX IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO REMOVE THIS ENTRY. XXXX XXXX informed me that they will also notify Equifax since they are the ones who reported it, even though they don't verify it. Obviously, this shouldn't be on my report since it was removed from XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX! I have uploaded proof as well.

Going over my report, I have found it has errors. It has come to my attention that you are reporting what I believe to be inaccurate data, which I dispute, and this letter is an appeal for your assistance. As a consumer reporting agency, 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( o ), you are governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, et seq., which protects consumers from inaccurate, outdated, or invalidated information reporting of their consumer file. The FCRA states that it's the consumer reporting agency 's responsibility to ensure that all information contained within consumer files is accurate and free from errors. Your company is regularly engaged in the business of assembling, evaluating, and disbursing information concerning consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( d ), to third parties.

According to federal law, you are required to comply with the requirements imposed under the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., including but not limited to : Follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information in the consumer report, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). This section imposes a high and often disregarded standard on consumer reporting agencies. See, e.g., XXXXXXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, at XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX XXXX.

'' ( quoting XXXX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) ) : Comply with the investigation requirements, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ; Should not provide consumer files to companies without determining that these companies had a permissible purpose to obtain consumer files pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ; Provide consumer file pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681g. 

Accordingly, I request your company to provide veritable documentary proof ( e.g., original consumer contract or similar proof bearing my wet ink signature on it ) you have on file. 

I am writing to formally dispute the accuracy of the information in my LexisNexis report.

1. Dispute of Account Reporting This account has been reported as written off as a profit/loss ( charge-off ). However, I have identified that the account is being repeatedly reported as a new charge-off account with an outstanding balance, despite being previously written off. This constitutes inaccurate and misleading reporting in violation of the FCRA, specifically : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Duty to ensure maximum possible accuracy of information.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : Duty to investigate disputes regarding furnished information.

By continuing to report this account inaccurately, Target Card Services is damaging my creditworthiness, resulting in defamation of character and material harm to my financial reputation.

2. Request for 1099-C Issuance As the account has been charged off, I am requesting that you provide a copy of the IRS Form 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ). The issuance of this form is required when a debt is canceled or written off and no longer collectible. Failure to provide this required documentation further demonstrates non-compliance with applicable consumer protection laws.

3. Cease-and-Desist Notification Under the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ), this letter serves as a formal cease-and-desist notice regarding all collection efforts related to this account. You are instructed to cease all forms of communication with me, including but not limited to phone calls, emails, or letters, regarding this account.

4. Demand for Resolution To resolve this matter, I demand the following actions be taken within 30 days : Immediately correct and remove the inaccurate information from all credit reporting agencies.

Provide a copy of the IRS Form 1099-C for the cancellation of this account, if applicable.

Confirm in writing that you have ceased all collection activities and communications related to this account.

Failure to comply with this dispute may result in legal action to enforce my rights under federal law.

I am writing to formally complain about XXXX XXXX ( VA location ) and her unprofessional, shocking, and downright appalling behavior during our recent phone and email interactions. She represents your company, Kinum, in the most unprofessional and disrespectful way imaginable. Her actions have left me angry, frustrated, and utterly shocked. 

During our interactions, she mocked my employment status, made inappropriate comments, and even threatened me by referencing my full address in an email, asking, Is this you? She also mentioned that Kinum has my full address, birthday, and Social Security number, which came across as a clear intimidation tactic. Such conduct is beyond unacceptableits outrageous and unethical. 

I demand that all communications, including calls and emails, be reviewed to confirm her behavior. Her remarks about how I pay my rent and her sarcasmsuch as saying, Seems like you dont have a car or a job. Stay warmI bet its cold out thereare insulting, degrading, and completely uncalled for. This is not how a customer or anyone should be treated, especially by someone acting on behalf of a professional organization.

This kind of behavior is a disgrace to your companys reputation, and I urge you to take immediate and decisive action. I expect a full investigation into this matter and appropriate disciplinary measures to ensure that no other customer experiences such mistreatment. I can not believe a company like Kinum allows this type of conduct from its employees. 

Please know that I am taking this matter very seriously and will be following up daily until I receive confirmation that this has been fully addressed and resolved. I will also be exploring all other avenues, including filing complaints with the CFPB, FTC, and my state attorney general, if I do not receive a satisfactory resolution.",,"Kinum, Inc., Indianapolis, IN Branch",MI,482XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11076677

Your continued refusal to address the substance of my dispute, properly validate the debt, or remedy the violations under applicable laws leaves me no choice but to escalate this matter. If a resolution is not achieved within 15 days, I will file for arbitration under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) rules, as outlined in your Consumer Credit Card Customer Agreement. 

Additionally, I have been a victim of XXXX XXXX, which has directly impacted the alleged debts in question. This information necessitates additional protections and remedies under federal and state laws. I urge you to review precedent where such debts were deemed invalid under these extraordinary circumstances. 

Key Issues and Legal Grounds Failure to Validate the Debt Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are required to provide adequate validation of debts and ensure the accuracy of information reported.

Case Law : In Saunders v. Branch Banking & Trust Co., 526 F.3d 142 ( 4th Cir. 2008 ), the court held that failing to report a debt as disputed is inherently misleading, violating 1681s-2 ( b ). You have failed to validate the account to address specific inaccuracies I previously highlighted.

Provide full documentation, including original creditor records, payment history, and the precise steps taken to verify the account. Without this, continued reporting constitutes a willful violation of FCRA. 

Impact of XXXX XXXX  on Debt Validity Debts incurred under duress, coercion, or through fraud related to trafficking are often invalidated. In Doe v. Debt Collector, courts have acknowledged the extraordinary circumstances and dismissed claims against trafficking victims.

Federal law ( 18 U.S.C. 1595 ) allows survivors of trafficking to seek damages and void debts incurred as a result of coercion. Your continued reporting of this account ignores these protections.

Reasonable Investigation Not Conducted Case Law : In Johnson v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX., 357 F.3d 426 ( 4th Cir. 2004 ), the court emphasized that furnishers must conduct a reasonable investigation upon notice of a dispute. Your failure to address material discrepancies I raised constitutes a breach of this obligation.

Damages Sought Wells Fargos ongoing violations of FCRA and FDCPA have caused significant emotional distress and financial harm. Courts, including in Gorman v. Wolpoff & Abramson , LLP, 584 F.3d 1147 ( 9th Cir. 2009 ), have recognized the right of consumers to recover damages for such violations.

Arbitration Intent In accordance with your Consumer Credit Card Customer Agreement, I will proceed with arbitration under the XXXX if this matter is not resolved within 15 days. I demand the following remedies : Immediate cessation of all reporting on this account. 
Full documentation validating the debt or written confirmation that the debt is invalid. 
Compensation of {$9000.00} for damages caused by your violations, including the emotional toll of your practices. 
Conclusion I urge you to address this matter promptly and provide a substantive resolution within the timeline specified. Failure to do so will result in immediate arbitration and pursuit of all applicable remedies under federal and state law.

2024-12-08,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"A {$7500.00} balance transfer that I had requested was posted on XX/XX/XXXX. For this transaction I was charged a 5 % fee with a promised promotional 0 % APR for 12 months. The balance transfer went through with no issues and I continued to use the credit card for new purchases regularly in the months following thinking that I would be able to pay off the new purchases each statement as normal while applying any excess to the promotional balance transfer balance. It is also relevant to include that at that time I had four active "" plans '' as part of the "" MY CHASE PLAN '' program that were posted on my XXXX statement totaling {$3100.00}. 

Now it is XX/XX/XXXX and I am finding on my last two posted statements that Chase is applying any payments that I make in excess of the minimum payment to the 0 % APR promotional balance transfer balance of {$7500.00} first, and charging me interest at 27.49 % APR for any new purchases that I make. I believe that this is a violation of the Credit Card Act of 2009 which requires credit card companies to apply payments in excess of the minimum payment amount to higher interest balances first. 

I contacted Chase with these concerns on XX/XX/XXXX by phone. They stated that the reason they are applying the payments so is because my credit card terms stipulate that I may only have one active promotion at a time, and the four "" MY CHASE PLAN '' offers that I had summarized before were already active and therefore negate the balance transfer that had already posted to my account with the 5 % fee applied. I am also confused as none of this was disclosed to me clearly in terms that I could understand and the balance transfer that I had requested had clearly been accepted and posted to my account with fees charged accordingly. Additionally, I had four "" plans '' active at the time which seems to contradict what Chase was saying about the card terms only allowing one promotion at a time.

Clearly I would have never initiated the balance transfer had it been disclosed to me honestly how future payments would be applied. Now, not only am I out the 5 % fee they charged me for the balance transfer, but I am continuing to pay the extremely high standard APR on balances that I didn't plan to carry as I had expected my payments to apply to the higher interest balance first.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,MI,48335,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11075097

2024-12-08,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Chrysler capital XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX Acct : XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to dispute inaccurate information on my credit report regarding the charge-off on the account referenced above. This letter is a formal request under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i, and I respectfully request the immediate removal or correction of the inaccuracies related to this account.

The following points outline my specific dispute : 1. Inaccurate XXXX Reporting : The charge-off listed on this account is inaccurate and must be corrected or removed. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681c, accounts that have been charged off must reflect the correct reporting of account status, including whether the debt was paid or settled. If the charge-off was reported in error or the information is not substantiated, it is required by law that it be corrected.

Please provide proof of the charge-off date and details of any payments or settlements made, as I believe this information is incorrect. If I have made any payments or settlements, I request that the reporting be updated to reflect this. If not, I request that this item be removed from my report as per the regulations governing charge-offs.

2. Joint Account Misreporting : The account in question is listed as a individual account, which is incorrect. Under 15 U.S.C. 1692a ( 6 ), debt collectors are required to report accurate information regarding the ownership and responsibility for a debt. If this account was mistakenly listed as a joint account, it must be corrected. As per 15 U.S.C. 1692f, the information provided must be accurate, and if there is any error in reporting joint responsibility, it should be rectified.

I request that the credit reporting agency verify the account and correct it to reflect the accurate responsibility ( either individual or joint ) for this debt.

3. 1099-C Request Ignored : I have submitted a request for a 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) form, as required by the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) 6050P. This form is necessary for reporting canceled debt that exceeds {$600.00}, which could affect my tax obligations. Despite my request, I have not received the 1099-C form or an appropriate response.

Under IRS guidelines, failure to issue the 1099-C form within a reasonable timeframe is a violation. I am requesting immediate action to provide me with the required 1099-C form and the appropriate documentation showing that the debt was canceled.

4. Request for Removal from Credit Report : Given the inaccuracies and failure to issue the necessary documentation, I am requesting that this account be removed from my credit report. Under the FCRA, inaccurate or unverifiable information must be deleted, and failure to respond to my dispute request within the legally mandated timeframe ( 30 days ) requires the immediate removal of this item from my credit file.

I kindly request that you thoroughly investigate these inaccuracies and remove any incorrect or unverifiable information related to this account from my credit report. If I do not receive a timely response, I will pursue further action under the FCRA and other applicable consumer protection laws.

Please respond in writing to my address listed above within the 30-day period mandated by the FCRA.",,"SANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.",TN,372XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11075280

I made payments of {$590.00} a month on this loan for a few years. Unfortunately, tough times hit again, and I fell behind on my payments. After several attempts to negotiate a solution with OneMain, which offered no help, I ultimately defaulted on the loan. Three years later, I found a collection for approximately {$12000.00} listed on my credit report. 

I called OneMain to negotiate a settlement and requested that the collection be removed from my credit report. We reached an agreement stating that I would begin making payments on the settlement, and in return, OneMain would remove the collection. However, OneMain has not honored their part of the agreement.

I have been a victim of identity theft, and as a result, I have been actively disputing several fraudulent entries on my credit report. I have followed the necessary steps to address this issue, including filing reports with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and initiating disputes with the relevant credit bureaus. While XXXX and XXXX have successfully removed the fraudulent accounts after verifying my claims, XXXX and XXXX have failed to comply with the proper procedure and continue to report inaccurate and fraudulent information on my credit report. 



As required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ), I am requesting that the fraudulent accounts be immediately removed from my credit file. The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies block any information that has been identified as fraudulent within four business days of receiving formal notice. The following accounts have been confirmed as fraudulent and should be removed from my reports without delay : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Removed XX/XX/year> ) XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( Removed XX/XX/year> ) XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Removed XX/XX/year> ) XXXX, XXXX ( Removed XX/XX/year> ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Removed XX/XX/year> ) XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( Removed XX/XX/year> ) XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX ( Removed XX/XX/year> ) I have already sent the necessary documentation, including FTC reports, to XXXX and XXXX, but despite these efforts, these bureaus have failed to act in accordance with the FCRA. 



I respectfully demand that you take immediate action to block these fraudulent items from my credit report as required by law. I would also like confirmation of their removal at the earliest possible opportunity. Should these accounts not be removed within the stipulated time frame, I will be compelled to escalate this matter further, including filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant regulatory bodies. 



I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your immediate compliance.

I dispute this debt in full, and I believe that your company is violating my consumer rights under federal law.

1 No Debt Owed ( 18 U.S.C. 8 ) : I assert that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 8, I owe no debt to your company or to any entity for the stated amount. This section of the U.S. Code generally pertains to obligations owed to the federal government. I reference this statute to clarify that no legal debt exists in my name with your company, nor do I owe any financial obligation for the amount claimed.

2 Violation of Privacy Rights ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ) : Your company is in violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which governs the permissible purposes for obtaining a consumer report. I do not consent to your company accessing or using my personal information without a lawful and permissible purpose. If you have accessed my credit report without such a valid reason, this constitutes a violation of my privacy rights.

3 Unauthorized Reporting ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ) : Furthermore, I assert that your company has no permission to report any information to credit reporting agencies regarding the alleged debt. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681e, reporting inaccurate or unauthorized information is prohibited, and you are required to ensure the information provided is accurate and authorized.

Given these violations, I demand the following : Immediate cessation of any further reporting or sharing of my personal or financial information with credit bureaus or third parties regarding this debt.

Verification of the debt and a complete itemized statement of the account, including the original creditor, any interest or fees charged, and the basis for your claim.

A written response confirming the removal of any inaccurate or unauthorized information reported to any credit bureaus.

Please note that if you continue to report this debt or take any collection actions against me without validating the debt or providing proper documentation, I will be forced to file a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and may pursue legal action for violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
I look forward to your prompt response. Failure to provide the requested documentation within 30 days will be considered a further violation of my consumer rights. 
Sincerely, [ Your Name ] [ Your Signature ( if sending by mail ) ] Notes : 1 Addressing the Statute Issue : 18 U.S.C. 8 doesn't directly apply to consumer debt, so Ive replaced the reference to clarify that you're disputing the debt and citing consumer protection laws ( FCRA ) instead.

2 Follow Up : Be sure to keep a copy of this letter for your records. Consider
sending it via certified mail with a return receipt requested to ensure it is received.

3 Monitoring : After sending this letter, keep track of any responses and continue to monitor your credit reports for any updates or actions taken by Cavalry Portfolio Services. 
Let me know if you'd like further revisions or help with any other legal letters!",,"CAVALRY INVESTMENTS, LLC",GA,30315,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11072901

2024-12-08,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"I opened a Discover account in XX/XX/2024. On XX/XX/2024 I went to my Discover card app and it was flagged that there was a problem with the account and for more info call Discover. 

I found out that Fraud Protection automatically CLOSED my account for no other reason than I apparently did not respond to a phone call from them for more identifying information about me. There was no balance due on the account and my payments had never been late. 

People get thousands of scam phone calls a day. This fact has apparently escaped Discover. At NO time, did Discover attempt to message me through the official app, where I would be assured that I was actually speaking with a Discover Card employee about my account. The telephone number I was given via voicemail was not the openly published Discover card number. I checked my account on the app when I received the voicemail to see that there were no fraudulent charges and I disregarded the call as a likely scam. 

When I saw the banner on the app I called Discover and was transferred to Discovers Fraud Protection department. I was told that they could not reopen the account. It was closed automatically by their computer system because I did not respond to Fraud Protection calls for more information about me. They acknowledged that there was not a problem with any balance owing on the account and my payments had been made on time, but closed the account anyway. There were no new or fraudulent charges on the account. 

They told me my only option was that I had to RE-OPEN a new account and they transferred me to a person working in new accounts. I answered all the questions to open a new account and I was then told that despite making XXXX figures and having a high XXXX  score, my request to open an account was DENIED because of the current status of my Discover account. 

I did nothing wrong - the account was paid timely and in full! While they can put a banner up on the app after the account is closed indicating that there is a problem with the account, they cant at least message me through their official app before they arbitrarily decided to close it?

Discover erroneously closed my account and now my credit has been affected because of the status of that closed account. I cant reopen the old account and I was denied opening a new account for no other reason than the creditor closed my account!

I have talked to countless people at Discover and have been transferred to numerous departments. Every single person has told me there is nothing they can do. I have never even heard of anything like this.

I want the account status restored and I do not want this affecting my credit score in any way.

We uploaded our master insurance policy ( effective XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) through their online portal. On XX/XX/XXXX, Pennymac reviewed and accepted this document, sending us a notice stating : "" The lender-placed coverage we reserved on your behalf has been canceled effective XX/XX/XXXX. ( see attached ) '' However, on XX/XX/XXXX, Pennymac unexpectedly asked us to provide proof of XXXX insurance coverage for the period XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. They warned that if we could not provide this proof, we would be charged for coverage during that time. This is the first time Pennymac has ever requested coverage beyond our master policy, and they are now asking us to obtain insurance retroactively. Purchasing insurance for an already-passed period is not only impossibleits completely unreasonable. 

Pennymac has since followed up twice, stating that if we can not provide the requested evidence, we will be charged {$110.00} for the coverage spanning XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Yet, after reviewing our mortgage statement today, we discovered that Pennymac created a new escrow account. Beginning next year, they plan to raise our monthly payment by {$34.00} for 12 months, totaling $ XXXXfar exceeding the previously mentioned {$110.00} ( see attached ). Furthermore, there is no assurance that these charges wont continue to escalate over time. 

We find this situation unfair for several reasons : Conflicting Information and Lack of Communication : If Pennymac found our initial evidence insufficient, why did they send a notice confirming that the lender-placed coverage was canceled? From XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, there was no mention of needing XXXX insurance for the earlier period. How can a customer be expected to purchase insurance retroactively? Moreover, how can a {$110.00} fee supposedly protect our property or the lenders interest now, when the coverage period has already passed?

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, MO. XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Complaint Against Gateway Financial Solutions Compliance Department Regarding Improper Use of My Credit File To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against Gateway Financial Solutions for violations of federal statutes related to the improper use of my credit file, reporting of information without consent, and failure to comply with legal obligations regarding debt reporting and income recognition. 

1. Unauthorized Use and Reporting of Credit Information : Gateway Financial Solutions has failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which specifies permissible purposes for obtaining and using consumer credit reports. I never provided written consent for Gateway Financial Solutions to report any information to my credit file. According to 16 CFR 313.7, financial institutions must obtain explicit authorization from consumers before sharing nonpublic personal information unless an exception applies, none of which are applicable here.

Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which Gateway Financial Solutions failed to do. Their actions also appear to violate 15 U.S.C. 6805, which empowers regulatory bodies to enforce these provisions.

2. Charge-Off Reporting and Misclassification : A charge-off is a bookkeeping designation used by creditors for tax purposes when they consider a debt uncollectible. Under federal tax law, a charge-off can be treated as a cancellation of debt, which may constitute income to the debtor. However, Gateway Financial Solutions did not issue a 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) form to me, as required under IRS regulations , to substantiate that the debt was canceled and classified as income. Without this form, their reporting of the charge-off to credit reporting agencies is not only improper but also misleading. 

Moreover, a charge-off does not represent a valid certificate of indebtedness. A certificate of indebtedness reflects a binding obligation that is enforceable ; a charge-off, by its nature, implies that the debt has been resolved or abandoned by the creditor. Reporting a charge-off to credit bureaus under these circumstances constitutes inaccurate reporting. 

3. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : Gateway Financial Solutions has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate Gateway Financial Solutions practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. XXXX ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ).

Additionally, I request clarification and appropriate remediation regarding : 1.The absence of a 1099-C form to substantiate the charge-off as canceled debt.

2.The improper classification of a charge-off as a certificate of indebtedness.

3.The unauthorized reporting of information to credit bureaus without my explicit written consent. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in ensuring compliance and protecting my rights as a consumer.

I did not authorize or provide consent for this credit inquiry to be made. Therefore, this inquiry is in violation of my rights under the FCRA.

1. Unauthorized Inquiry and Request for Removal The unauthorized inquiry in question must be removed from my credit report immediately. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b, it is a violation for a credit report to be accessed without the consumer 's consent for an impermissible purpose. I request that you investigate this matter and remove the unauthorized inquiry from my report in accordance with the law.

2. Damages and Penalties In addition to the removal of the unauthorized inquiry, I am requesting {$1000.00} in damages under the provisions of the FCRA. Specifically, 15 U.S.C. 1681n provides for statutory damages for willful violations of the FCRA, which includes the unauthorized access of a consumers credit report. In accordance with this provision, I am entitled to receive damages for any harm caused by this violation, including the {$1000.00} statutory damages allowed for willful noncompliance.

Further, under 15 U.S.C. 1681o, I am entitled to actual damages if it is found that the inquiry was not only unauthorized but also caused harm to my creditworthiness, and any additional penalties for reckless disregard of the FCRA.

3. Request for Written Response Please provide a written response within 30 days of receiving this letter confirming that the unauthorized inquiry has been removed from my credit report, and that the necessary action has been taken to address this violation of the FCRA. Additionally, please provide any documentation of the investigation and corrective actions taken regarding this matter.

XXXX XXXX refunded XXXX, the cost of the storage shed due to unknown reasons. The green house was never delivered and when we attempted to resolve the issue with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) they did not make delivery of the greenhouse or issue a refund. 
I contacted Citizens bank on XXXX XXXX and filed a claim to dispute the XXXX charge. Citizens Bank initially issued a credit for XXXX following which I received a correspondence from Citizens on XXXX XXXX stating that the 'merchant provided documents shows that the services were rendered as contracted '. The letter from Citizens also noted that I am obligated to pay the entire disputed amount of XXXX ( please note that the amount I disputed is XXXX ( XXXX ). This letter also informed me that if I wished to continue the dispute to submit additional information to Citizens Bank no later than XXXX XXXX. 
When I received this letter from Citizens Bank, I contacted Citizens bank on XX/XX/year> via Phone and spoke to a supervisor in the fraud department and notified him that I am still disputing the claim. He filed two claims, claim number XXXX for the claims department and XXXX for the executive office, apparently to escalate my complaint to the respective departments. I informed the supervisor during this call that I would like all correspondence from Citizens Bank in writing only. 
Please note that the documentation submitted to Citizens Bank by XXXX XXXX and subsequently delivered to me in the later dated XX/XX/year> was very difficult to read due the font size and contrast. I did locate a XXXX tracing number that XXXX XXXX had included in the correspondence contacted XXXX, and was told by XXXX to contact XXXX XXXX products, and provided with a XXXX phone number to XXXX. I contacted XXXX and was informed that XXXX deals with home appliances and not with green houses and hence they were unable to assist me further. 
I informed Citizens bank via email, as a return email to a previous correspondence that I received from Citizens, on XXXX XXXX to inform them about the above conversation with XXXX and XXXX and asked Citizens to investigate this transaction further. 
I did not receive any reply to my email dated XXXX XXXX or to the two claims filed by the supervisor in the fraud department as XXXX XX/XX/year>. When I contacted Citizens Bank on XXXX XXXX I was informed that claims department had noted on my account that they did not receive any correspondence from me as of XX/XX/year> ( which is not true, I sent an e-mail on XXXX XXXX as noted above ) and hence the dispute is closed and the charge of XXXX has been applied to my account for me to pay. 
Please note that I had extensive conversations with Citizens on XXXX XXXX during which I was notified that I am unable to speak to someone in claims department in a customer initiated phone call which makes it difficult to resolve the issue or provide information to the department that is directly involved in this dispute.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",MI,48183,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,In progress,Yes,,11073024

Despite three previous attempts to resolve these issues and over 90 days passing since my initial disputewell beyond the legally mandated 30-day period under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) these inaccuracies remain unresolved. The credit bureaus have not complied with federal and state laws requiring the removal and blocking of fraudulent accounts and inquiries.

Violations Committed : Failure to Investigate and Resolve Disputes : FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) mandates that credit bureaus investigate and resolve disputes within 30 days. More than 90 days have elapsed since my initial dispute without resolution.

Failure to Notify of Negative Information : Under 15 U.S.C. 1692g, creditors are required to notify consumers within five days of reporting a debt. I was never notified of these fraudulent accounts and inquiries. 

Failure to Ensure Maximum Accuracy : FCRA 607 ( b ) requires credit bureaus to ensure the maximum accuracy of the information they report. Discrepancies in balances, credit limits, and reporting dates indicate noncompliance.

Failure to Remove and Block Fraudulent Accounts : Under FCRA 605B, upon receipt of evidence of identity theft, credit bureaus are required to remove and block fraudulent accounts and inquiries from credit reports. Despite providing substantial evidence, this has not occurred. 

Failure to Protect Consumer Data : Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( 15 U.S.C. 6801-6809 ), financial institutions and credit bureaus are required to safeguard consumer information. The presence of these fraudulent accounts demonstrates a failure to protect my data.

Identity Theft Protections Ignored : The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ) criminalizes the unauthorized use of personal information. The fraudulent accounts and inaction by the bureaus violate my rights under this statute. 

State Law Violations : Under Florida Statute 817.568, identity theft is addressed as a criminal offense. The credit bureaus failure to act constitutes a violation of state protections. 

Fraudulent Accounts and Inquiries : XXXX  Loans ( Account # XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) : Fraudulent accounts added without consent. 

Discrepancies in balances and reporting dates. 

Violations of 15 U.S.C. 1692g as I was not notified within five days prior to their reporting. 

XXXX XXXX ( Account # XXXX ) : Fraudulent account added without consent. 

Discrepancies in balances and reporting dates. 

Violations of 15 U.S.C. 1692g as I was not notified within five days prior to its reporting.

These accounts are fraudulent and were added to my credit report without my consent. Additionally, these accounts show discrepancies and lack proper validation.

Requested Resolution : Under FCRA 605B, I demand the immediate removal and permanent blocking of these accounts and inquiries from my credit report. Additionally, I request : A thorough investigation into the reporting failures and evidence of identity theft. 

Written confirmation of the removal and blocking of these accounts and inquiries. 

Implementation of fraud alerts and compliance with federal and state identity theft protections. 

The continued presence of these fraudulent accounts on my credit report has caused significant financial harm and emotional distress. If these issues are not resolved promptly, I will pursue legal action to protect my rights and escalate this matter to other regulatory authorities.

I am distressed that you have included the information below on my credit profile and that you have failed to maintain reasonable procedures in your operations to assure maximum possible accuracy in the credit reports you publish.

Every step must be taken to assure the information reported is completely accurate and correct.The following information therefore needs to be re-investigated. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law to verify, through the physical verification of the original signed document contract, any and all accounts that you post on a credit report. Otherwise anyone paying for your reporting services could fax, mail or email in a fraudulent account. I demand to see verifiable proof ( i.e. : an original customer contract with my signature in it ) that you have on file for the accounts listed below. Your failure to positively verify these accounts has hurt my ability to obtain credit.

Account Accuracy : I request that the credit bureau confirm with the creditor all details about this account, including payment history, account balance, and charge-off validity. 

Verification Documentation : Under the FCRA, I have the right to request the documentation that verifies the legitimacy of these accounts. Without proper evidence, these entries must be removed from my credit file. 

Tax Implications : If the creditor issued a 1099-C for this account, the IRS considers the debt settled or forgiven. As such, it may not remain valid for collection or reporting as a charge-off.

Resolution Sought : Please investigate and remove all inaccuracies regarding the above accounts. If the creditors fail to provide accurate, complete, and timely documentation, I request the deletion of these entries. 

Supporting Documentation : I have enclosed copies of my credit report highlighting the disputed accounts for your reference. 

I expect a written response and resolution to this matter within 30 days as stipulated by the FCRA. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

I am listed on the mortgage, the note, and the deed, yet during my divorce, my ex-husbandwho was court-ordered to pay the mortgagefailed to make payments. Despite this, XXXX XXXX ignored the issue, and my phone calls to Rocket Mortgage always ended with them refusing to communicate with me. They repeatedly stated that I was not their client, refused to provide any assistance, and hung up on me. 

Although they refused to communicate with me, they foreclosed on the property, sending letters addressed to me, my ex-husband, and even to my unknown spouse. When I contacted their lawyers at XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was told they would go after me and destroy me. I have recordings of all my phone calls with Rocket Mortgage, as I always informed them of the recordings. 

I was ultimately forced to repurchase my house through a XXXX sale and pay a 6 % fee because Rocket Mortgage refused to address the situation. My family paid off the mortgage through the XXXX on XX/XX/year>. However, as of XX/XX/year>, I have yet to receive any discharge of mortgage or warrant of satisfaction. Despite calling and emailing their lawyers at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have been completely ignored. 

I also contacted the XXXX, but they can not provide the necessary documents from Rocket Mortgage. I have received no summary of the payments I made. Furthermore, I paid for insurance for the entire year, and when I contacted Rocket Mortgage to address this, I had to make multiple calls and speak to a XXXX. Eventually, I was informed that they had no record of the mortgage being paid off. They said they would cancel the insurance but provided no clear timeline for when this would happen or how I would be reimbursed for the premiums I had already paid. They even mentioned that if any reimbursement were issued, it would go to my ex-husbanddespite the fact that he did not contribute anything toward the mortgage. 

As of today, the mortgage is still recorded against my house, even though it was paid off XXXX months ago. I have not received any documentation, refunds for the insurance, or acknowledgment of the payoff. I was forced to pay a 6 % fee on the entire mortgage and endured extreme stress due to Rocket Mortgages refusal to act responsibly. 

The way I was treated by Rocket Mortgage was appalling. Their handling of this situation was a complete failure, marked by incompetence and unacceptable behavior.",,"Rocket Mortgage, LLC",NJ,087XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11065807

So he sent me {$50.00} thru paypal. {$53.00} all together because the way he sent it cost him a fee. I never even see a payment like he sent b4. Anyway right after he sent it I go to the transaction and says my account has limitations to verify these transactions. 1 transaction turned into me having to verify 3 times pretty much the same way. They said what was ur transaction for, I won'ted to say none of ur business. Anyway the man has a business paypal account and he said his payments come out like that. The payment had me having to create a shipping label and stuff I said I ain't never seen a payment like this. I told paypal on all 3 verifications that all it was was somebody sending me money an didn't know the difference in goods and services or friends and family that's it. Then I tried to refund the money and they wudnt let me, then wudnt even let him request a refund. This was XX/XX/XXXX a lil after 1 when the money was sent. I tried to call support and the operator wudnt put a human on because she figured she cud do everything. So I waited and waited I was hungery I was getting something to eat with that money, eventually I check my email and there a message from PayPal saying thanks for being patience were reviewing ur submissions let u know it 72 hours ... I was nice then then another message saying I sent ur submissions to the backend team there reviewing this and that. Then I said what'd there to review? A man send the money the wrong way by accident that's it problem solved. Then they said something about another 72 hours and hope I'm happy with there assistance and thanks for being a valuable customer. I said easy for somebody with money to say im waiting 72 hours for my money to feed my family I dnt plan on being a valuable customer much longer. I have all the screenshot but long story short they said I cudnt withdraw my funds til 120-180 days and I blanked on them. Didn't even tell me why so all I'm pose to think and know is because I received money from someone that sent it wrong. Something i have no control over.

I assure you that i received no email of the impending transfer and I did not receive a text message. My old mortgage servicer has all that information and could have notified me. 

If I had gotten the 15-day notice I would have immediately paid off my mortgage which is probably the exact reason NO mortgage company likes to give advance notice.

2024-12-08,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Communication tactics,"You told them to stop contacting you, but they keep trying","Issue Whether United Check Recovery Bureau , Inc. ( UCRB ) violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), and New York debt collection laws by repeatedly contacting third parties despite explicit instructions not to do so and by ignoring the complainants stated preferred methods of communication. 

Rule Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ) : Restricts unsolicited communications and mandates adherence to consumer contact preferences. 

Prohibits harassment via calls or messages, including the use of prerecorded messages or calls to unintended parties without consent. 

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : Limits debt collectors from contacting third parties except for location information, and only under strict guidelines. 

Prohibits communication after receiving instructions to stop and bans any behavior that may be construed as harassment. 

New York Debt Collection Laws ( General Business Law 601 ) : Protects consumers and third parties from harassing, oppressive, or abusive debt collection practices. 

Requires compliance with communication limitations explicitly requested by the debtor.

Application A. Preferred Contact Methods Ignored : The complainant informed UCRB to contact only via a specific phone number and email address. These instructions were ignored.

No calls were made to the specified number, nor were any emails sent, violating the TCPA and FDCPAs requirement to honor consumer communication preferences. 

B. Unauthorized Third-Party Contacts : On XX/XX/year>, XXXX from UCRB left a voicemail with an associate of the complainant seeking location information. 

Despite a follow-up voicemail from the complainant on XX/XX/year>, directing UCRB to cease contacting associates, a similar voicemail was left with at least one other associate on XX/XX/year>. 

These actions contravene both the FDCPA and New York laws restricting third-party contact. 

C. Complainant Attempts to Resolve the Issue : On XX/XX/year>, the complainant left a voicemail on UCRB 's line, clearly stating that contacting associates would be considered harassment and providing explicit instructions for contact via phone and email. 

On XX/XX/year>, the complainant left another voicemail on UCRB 's line. This voicemail, which was recorded, stated that UCRB may only contact the complainant by way of the specified email. 

On XX/XX/year>, the complainant spoke directly with XXXX, a UCRB representative. During this conversation, the complainant reiterated that UCRB may only contact him via the specified email and/or phone number. He also emphasized that they are not allowed to contact any other associates, reaffirming his communication preferences. 

D. Business Management and Contact Information : According to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ), the President of United Check Recovery Bureau , Inc. is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

E. Repeated Violations and Evidence of Harassment : UCRB ignored these instructions and continued contacting associates, engaging in behavior amounting to harassment. 
The complainant will present evidence, including : Voicemail Recordings : Voicemails left by "" XXXX '' on associates ' phones, illustrating unauthorized third-party contact. 

Phone Call Recordings : Recordings of calls between the complainant and UCRB representatives, pre-authorized by the parties involved. These recordings document the complainants clear instructions and UCRBs acknowledgment of the restrictions. 
Email Communication : A copy of the demand letter sent to UCRBs email address outlining the allegations and specifying contact restrictions. 

Preferred Outcome The complainant seeks the following outcomes : UCRB immediately ceases all violations of the TCPA, FDCPA, and New York debt collection laws. 

UCRB adheres to the complainants specified communication preferences, contacting only via the email address and phone number provided in the demand letter, two voicemails, and the verbal conversation with XXXX. 

UCRB stops all harassment via calls or messages.

UCRB prohibits further communication with the complainants associates under any circumstances.

Conclusion United Check Recovery Bureau , Inc. violated the TCPA, FDCPA, and New York debt collection laws by : Failing to adhere to the complainants specified communication methods. 
Persistently contacting third parties in direct violation of the complainants instructions. 
Engaging in harassing behavior through repeated unauthorized communications. 
The complainant has substantial evidence, including voicemail recordings, phone call recordings, and email correspondence, to substantiate claims of harassment and statutory violations.",,"United Check Recovery Bureau, Inc.",PR,00791,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11077073

If this debt has been forgiven, canceled, or settled for less than the full balance, the IRS 1099-C form is required to be filed under 26 U.S.C. 6050P if the amount of canceled debt exceeds {$600.00}.

In addition to the 1099-C form, I am disputing the accuracy of the debt and requesting verification in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Reinvestigation of Disputed Information ), and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information ) . I am entitled to request and receive complete documentation to verify the accuracy and legality of this account 's reporting, and I am invoking my rights under [ Mississippi ] law to receive proper validation of this debt.

Written Communication Only : Please be advised that I am requesting written communication only regarding this matter.

I do not wish to receive any phone calls or other forms of communication. Any correspondence should be directed to the address listed above. This request is made pursuant to my right under 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which entitles me to request that all communication from you be in writing.

Requests for Documentation : 1. 1099-C Form : 2. If the debt has been discharged, forgiven, or settled for less than the full amount, I request that you provide a copy of the 1099-C form filed with the IRS. This form is required when the forgiven amount exceeds {$600.00}. If you have not filed this form, or if you can not provide it, I will assume that the debt has been discharged and should no longer be reported as owed on my credit report. Failure to file the 1099-C may constitute fraudulent reporting of the debt.

3. Authenticated Double Entry Accounting Records : In addition to the 1099-C, I am requesting full double-entry accounting records for the account in question. This should include a detailed breakdown that shows all transactions, including the original balance, payments, interest, fees, and any other adjustments made to the account. Please ensure that the records comply with standard accounting practices, and provide authenticated evidence of the debt, rather than a simple list of charges or account statements. The court ruling in Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo, 174 F.3d 394 ( 4th Cir.

1999 ), states that debt collectors must provide verified and authenticated documentation, not merely conclusory statements.

4. Proof of Legal Right to Report and Collect the Debt : I also request authenticated evidence, in compliance with [ Your State ] law, that you have the legal right to report and collect this debt. This should include the original signed contract or agreement showing my obligation to pay the debt and your legal right to enforce collection and report it to the credit bureaus. In Spears v. Brennan, 745 N.E.2d 862 ( Ind.

Ct. App. 2001 ), the court held that creditors must provide original signed documentation to prove the validity of a debt. Failure to provide this evidence could result in violations of both state and federal consumer protection laws.

Request for Deletion if Evidence is Not Provided : If you are unable to provide the requested documentation or proof of the debt, I request that you immediately delete this account from my credit report in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2. Under these provisions, you are required to investigate and correct any inaccuracies in the information you report to consumer reporting agencies.

2024-12-08,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Formal Response to XXXXXXXX XXXX Noncompliance with U.S. Codes and CFPB Guidelines. 
XXXX XXXX Department, I am writing in response to your inadequate and dismissive handling of my complaint submitted through the CFPB Complaint Portal. Your response regarding the tradeline from NATIONAL CREDIT ADJUSTERS demonstrates a clear disregard for your obligations under federal law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and guidelines established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). Your vague assertion that XXXX is either currently processing that dispute or has recently provided results is not only insufficient but also a blatant violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), which mandates that consumer reporting agencies conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a dispute is submitted. By failing to provide transparency in your investigation process and evidence supporting the disputed tradeline, you are in clear noncompliance with the FCRA. 
Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 2 ) you are required to notify the furnisher of disputed information promptly and provide them with all relevant information regarding the dispute. Your failure to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the investigation violates this provision. Additionally, if the information can not be verified, it must be deleted from my credit report under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) Your approach is disrespectful not only to me as a consumer but also to the regulatory framework established by the CFPB, which emphasizes the importance of fair and accurate reporting practices. The continued presence of inaccurate information in my credit file and your vague responses highlight systemic noncompliance with federal law and CFPB guidelines.

I demand the following actions : 1. A **detailed explanation** of the investigation process you conducted regarding this specific tradeline.

2. **Full disclosure of all evidence and correspondence** from NATIONAL CREDIT ADJUSTERS used to substantiate their claim.

3. Immediate deletion of unverifiable or inaccurate information, as required by **15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) **.

4. A mailed copy of my **updated credit report** showing all corrections made.

Failure to meet these obligations will result in additional regulatory complaints and legal action. Under **15 U.S.C. 1681n** and **15 U.S.C. 1681o**, you are liable for both willful and negligent noncompliance with the FCRA , including statutory damages, actual damages, and attorney fees.

I expect a comprehensive response and resolution within 15 days. Any further evasion or noncompliance will be reported to the CFPB and other regulatory agencies for review and enforcement action.

Equifax Dispute Department, I am writing in response to your inadequate and dismissive handling of my complaint submitted through the CFPB Complaint Portal. Your response regarding the tradeline from XXXX XXXX XXXX demonstrates a clear disregard for your obligations under federal law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and guidelines established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). Your vague assertion that Equifax is either currently processing that dispute or has recently provided results is not only insufficient but also a blatant violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), which mandates that consumer reporting agencies conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a dispute is submitted. By failing to provide transparency in your investigation process and evidence supporting the disputed tradeline, you are in clear noncompliance with the FCRA.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 2 ) you are required to notify the furnisher of disputed information promptly and provide them with all relevant information regarding the dispute. Your failure to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the investigation violates this provision. Additionally, if the information can not be verified, it must be deleted from my credit report under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) Your approach is disrespectful not only to me as a consumer but also to the regulatory framework established by the CFPB, which emphasizes the importance of fair and accurate reporting practices. The continued presence of inaccurate information in my credit file and your vague responses highlight systemic noncompliance with federal law and CFPB guidelines.

I demand the following actions : 1. A **detailed explanation** of the investigation process you conducted regarding this specific tradeline.

2. **Full disclosure of all evidence and correspondence** from XXXX XXXX XXXX used to substantiate their claim.

3. Immediate deletion of unverifiable or inaccurate information, as required by **15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) **.

4. A mailed copy of my **updated credit report** showing all corrections made.

Failure to meet these obligations will result in additional regulatory complaints and legal action. Under **15 U.S.C. 1681n** and **15 U.S.C. 1681o**, you are liable for both willful and negligent noncompliance with the FCRA , including statutory damages, actual damages, and attorney fees.

I expect a comprehensive response and resolution within 15 days. Any further evasion or noncompliance will be reported to the CFPB and other regulatory agencies for review and enforcement action.

2024-12-08,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Dear Sirs : My third estimated tax payment for XXXX - check number XXXX in the amount of {$59000.00} payable to United States Treasury from my personal Wells Fargo checking account ( # ending in XXXX ) - was mailed to the IRS on XX/XX/XXXX. It was stolen from the US Postal Service, altered, and fraudulently cashed by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I was notified by the IRS on XX/XX/XXXX ( after filing my XXXX tax return ) that I owed {$59000.00} plus penalty and interest. I immediately searched my bank records and discovered the theft, which I promptly reported to Wells Fargo Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have filed a XXXX Police Dept Report ( XXXX # XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX and Sgt. XXXX has been assigned to the case. Their investigation is about to be launched. I also filed a report with the United States Postal Service on XXXX # XXXX being handled by Area Inspector XXXX XXXX ( phone # XXXX XXXX XXXX I am informed by XXXX XXXX that the FBI does not investigate fraud for any amount less than {>= $1,000,000}. I have not heard back from him. 
Wells Fargo Claim Department has denied my claim stating that it was not reported within thirty days of the statement date on which the check appeared which would have been the XX/XX/XXXX statement. 
This is unfair since I reported the fraud/theft promptly upon discovery. 
Despite numerous phone calls made by me to the Wells Fargo Claim Dept, they will not send me any information in their files regarding the receiving bank that cashed the check, or the manner in which it was cashed. Furthermore, they will not provide me with any information regarding what precautions/policies that Wells Fargo has in place to prevent this type of bank fraud from being perpetrated against their customers. 
In summary, Wells Fargo has ignored my request for information regarding the theft. This has and will continue to hamper further investigations to be made by law enforcement. I maintain that I reported the theft promptly to Wells Fargo and that Wells Fargo has inadequate policies in place to prevent this type of fraudulent activity. Wells Fargo Bank is liable for and should reimburse me for my entire loss in the amount of {$59000.00}.

In XXXX, I opened a personal XXXX and gold credit card with American Express using my SSN. I later opened a business XXXX card using my EIN number and they reported they needed my SSN number to verify my identity. 

I notice that my American Express business credit cards started to show up on my credit scores. I called American Express and asked them to verify to the last two number they had listed on the business credit cards for the EIN number. The last two numbers they provided were my SSN number and not the EIN number. I asked if American Express had their business credit card customers combine their personal American express credit cards together. They reported no, that they are kept different and are not combined. I then asked, then why did American express have my personal American express credit cards mixed in with my business credit cards and using my SSN for all the credit cards and not using my business EIN number as they were suppose to be doing from the very beginning. 

They asked me where on my account was I was able to see that ; I informed them I noticed it on my credit report. They were not able to provided me with an explanation as to why they used my SSN and basically put the blame on me and stated "" I should have changed it from the very beginning to my EIN and if I wanted to changed it ; I would need to close out the cards and reapply. '' I was furious as I had originally applied with my EIN number and they scammed me asking me for my SSN to "" verify '' my identity. 

They have not ruined my credit score, had charged interests on my business credit cards, have declined payments on credit cards that have "" no spending limits '' yet inform me that the payments were declined due to "" spending over my limit '' - how can I spend over my limit when the card clearly states 'there is no spending limit. '' They then started decreasing the credit limits on my other credit cards even though there was no balance due and even when payments were being made on time and "" no balance due at this time '' was indicated in the account. They also informed me I was able to receive up to 5 employee business cards with no membership fees ; I ordered two cards and then was charged a {$350.00} membership fee for each card.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,FL,349XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11064123

2024-12-08,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"In XXXX my parents made the decision to send me out of the state of Texas for college. I was enrolled into XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. I did not graduate with my degree due to lack of financial resources. I was XXXX XXXX XXXX when I was sent to Oklahoma. During the enrollment process the college advised my parents and myself that we were going to need more financial resources than what Federal Student Loans qualified me. Little did I understand how Federal Student Loan funding initially worked. XX/XX/XXXX a disbursement of {$5000.00} with a XXXX variable interest rate was made to XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX another disbursement of {$5000.00} with a XXXX variable interest rate was made to XXXX XXXX. Although I am grateful my parents made the decision to take out private student loans on my behalf, this decision was not the best financial decision for myself. Having little knowledge and understanding how a variable interest rate student loan would immensely effect my financial future. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX. of {$5300.00} was applied to the total loan equaling to {$15000.00}. XX/XX/XXXX payments began ( I had transferred to a online college to get my actual degree. I was financially unable to fund the last few classes at XXXX XXXX to obtain my XXXX XXXX in XXXX ). Again, I did not fully understand the future financial hardship this was going to cause me. The student loan was originally owned by XXXX XXXX. From XXXX until XXXX when the student loan was converted to Firstmark Services, I had already paid {$2900.00} towards the principle balance and {$6500.00} towards interest. From XX/XX/XXXX ( the time XXXX XXXX converted the student loan to Firstmark Services ) to current day, the total amount that has been paid to the principle balance is {$5800.00} and the total amount paid in interest is {$11000.00} with a 13.490 % VARIABLE. This combines a total loan payback with interest of {$17000.00}. As of XXXX XXXX a pay off quote of {$9800.00}. A loan statement as of XX/XX/XXXX shows a estimated XXXX XXXX XXXX of {$16000.00}. A late payment fee was issued on XXXX XXXX. Prior to the date payments were made on time as well as to present day, today. Again, being XXXX XXXX XXXX at the original disbursement of the college loans, I was very uneducated at the future financial downfall impact this was going to have. I have made request for lower monthly payments, I have request the remainder of loan forgiveness or even a settlement within a certain time frame of payout. I have reached out to my parents in hopes to receive advice or relief with the student loan debt I obtained at the early age of XXXX XXXX XXXX. No resolution has been found. As of today, I have filed bankruptcy, endured financial hardships, often times unable to pay my bills due to the overload of student loan debt that has a estimated combined total of {$80000.00}. The cost of living and the student loan debt has placed a hardship of living at minimal. The mental and emotional stress the student loan debt has impacted my life. With the debt to income ration with vast majority of student loans, I have been unsuccessful in obtaining a refinance loan with a lower FIXED interest rate. I have been made aware I am 'too high risk ' because of my high debt to income ratio. ' Since this financial hardship due to the student loan crisis, I have been unable and unsuccessful to start a college fund for my own child. The import thing I have learned during this process is educating myself of the lack of knowledge I had as well my parents had during my college process. I have educated myself immensely to help provide better guidance for my child when the time comes to her college education.",,"Nelnet, Inc.",OK,74403,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11071471

2024-12-08,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"This is an accurate written account of issues I have had with large corporations. Discover Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX 

I have always had amazing credit. I got a Discover credit card in XXXX after separating from my ex husband. Only my name, my account. I hardly ever used my card and when I did I paid on time every month more than the required amount owed. I had always had trouble logging into my account and when I did everything looked fine, but I did notice my balance going up after a few months and I couldnt understand why. But I didnt see anything unusual at the time. It was in XX/XX/XXXX that I lost my job. I went on XXXX  and got an XXXX XXXX to help take care of my XXXX kids. I reached out and explained my situation to Discover and for a while they were happy to defer my payments. I paid a little here and there when I had a little extra money. 

I hardly ever received any paper mail from Discover with my transactions and balance paid amounts, which I changed many times on my account when I logged in. But again, I hardly ever used the card, it was more for emergencies. When I would get an email or paper mail from them it was, your payment of $ x is due on xx/xx ). So, I paid through my bank and their link. 

It was when I wasnt able to pay on a regular basis that my amount due kept going up and up. Again, I worked with them for a long time making sure I wouldnt mess my credit score up for being late. I have held over a XXXX ( mid XXXX ) for years and years and it took me over XXXX years to get it to that, then in less than a few months it went well below a XXXX for being late just a few times. 

Then in XXXX I started receiving mail from lawyers wanting to represent me in my case against Discover. I had no idea what they were talking about. I had not received ANYTHING from Discover in over a year and I had no idea they were now trying to sue me, through the help of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. I looked up my court number ( given by a mail lawyer ) in XXXX XXXX, XXXX Said Discover had written off my account but this law firm was coming after the total amount of over {$13000.00}, again I didnt even know what purchases were made in that amount, barring the few transactions I knew I had made and that was XXXX years earlier. Also, once I was unable to pay my account I was locked out completely from my online account. So I couldnt see that my charges were going up and up. I filed paperwork with the court requesting to see what all the charges were within my Discover account. I did receive these documents from the lawyer, however, they only sent dates XX/XX/XXXX and up. I had the card several months before that so I dont even know what was charged before that. Also, when I received the credit card statements there were missing dates and many line items were blackened out for me not to see the information. If you get the billing statements, look at the date and time for many of the purchases. I'd have to be in XXXX different states on the same exact days. Many times over. Hotels, restaurants, etc. 

Anyway, looking through the charges that I used I started noticing page after page of fraudulent charges from restaurants I never ate at nor heard of, plane travel to destinations I hadnt been to, theme parks, gas stations in cities I never drove through nor lived around, hotels, XXXX, travel insurance, the list goes on. I immediately called XXXX and told them what had happened. I also had XXXX other credit cards, of smaller spending limits that were both maxed out and they sent me to collections. XXXX XXXX and XXXX. I too got a hold of those statements and found they both had fraudulent charges. I disputed them with XXXX. Discover said, we investigated the charges and they were all correct and that I disagreed. They never even called me to ask me questions. I disputed all three credit cards with known fraudulent charges, which I would have been happy to furnish, but they all basically called me a liar. 

I also found out that my ex husband had opened up a XXXX XXXX in my name and with my information. When I called XXXX I spoke with a gentleman and after telling him my name, birth date, and social security, he told me he did see an account with this information but I wasnt allowed to access it and it was in my ex husbands name, but he had opened the account while we were still married, XXXX of XXXX is when he opened it. But the line went quiet and he asked me to hold a moment. A woman then got on the phone and told me the guy had made a mistake and my social security number was not associated with this account, but my name and other information was and that I wasnt allowed to have access to it and to forget about the account and delete the information I had to log in to the account. Then she hung up. 

My ex also was receiving the government checks, we legally separated in XXXX of XXXX, he kept receiving these checks but never told me about any of them. I have mailed in a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX and I have still heard nothing from the IRS about where it was deposited to. I also ended up having to pay taxes on that money, that I didn't receive, instead of a single mom with XXXX kids getting the correct refund. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX has not been holding up their end of the bargain by making sure our information stays safe. I get spam calls and emails all the time. My bank account information has been stolen I don't know how many times and yet they still charge a fortune and won't be help responsible for financial pain and emotional suffering I have had to deal with regarding my credit card statements, bank accounts opening in my name, my social and name address etc being put on the dark web. My phone had been hacked, my emails had been hacked, I started not having any mail coming to me, including information from the IRS that I have been expecting and still havent received. Even in my new residence I was expecting a letter. Checked on the status and called and they said it was delivered to my address, but I never saw it. 

I have been taking all the necessary precautions to protect my identity, but keep getting beat down. These few accounts have completely ruined my credit and my ability to buy, rent, or get a mortgage. Large deposits have been required as a down payments, when Ive rented, security deposit, utility deposit, etc. which I have never had to do before. I am so frustrated. Once I sent the court document, I havent heard anything from anyone, including Discovers law firm. I finally contacted the law firm and Discover trying to get to the bottom of what needs to be done. The law firm said I needed to speak with Discover and Discover told me they didn't have anything to do with it any more. So I am not being helped with either party. Again, this has HUGELY impacted my life negatively. 

XXXX, XXXX, nor XXXX have helped either. They have just listened to what the companies have said and not me and what is on report doesn't help and have lowered my score. Also, XXXX and XXXX companies DO NOT have the right information on my credit file and they make it incredibly difficult to update anything and they cost a lot in order to view MY own credit score that I need to see if I have more identity theft problems. I can't even change my address and name on the accounts without calling them OR mailing MY personal information I.e a copy of my social security card, drivers license, passport, ummm all the items I'm trying to not have people steal easier then they already have. I have had phone numbers, addresses, accounts added to my credit report that were not nor ever have been mine. But they won't update my information until I mail them these items. They should just look at my social security number they have on file and review name changes and addresses, etc. 

I can send anyone the full statement reports if needed from Discover and their law firm.

I specifically made this purchase to receive a promotional credit, as advertised by Chase Bank on the app, for {$100.00} back with a Chase Travel purchase of at least {$500.00} on my Chase Freedom Unlimited card by XX/XX/year>. I never received this credit from Chase Bank ; therefore, on XX/XX/year>, I called and spoke with a Chase representative who created an escalation case and told me that I needed to send a message on the Chase app including proof of purchase. Accordingly, on XX/XX/year>, I submitted a message to Chase through the app indicating that I was waiting to receive the {$100.00} credit and providing an attachment that showed my email receipt for the travel booking made through the Chase app, including a time stamp showing that the purchase was made on XX/XX/XXXX. Over the next two weeks, I received several conflicting messages ( via app ) from Chase Card Services stating that my request had been forwarded to another department, that I would receive a response in one to two business days, and that Chase Card Services was experiencing a large volume of requests. On XX/XX/year>, I emailed Chase again via app to say that I never received a response to my message. On XX/XX/year>, Chase Card Services sent a response on the app saying that my purchase wasnt eligible because the purchase was made with my Chase Sapphire Reserve card. This response is untrue as the purchase is clearly posted on my bank statement for my Chase Freedom Unlimited Card. 

Around this time, I also received a letter in the mail dated XX/XX/year>, from Chase that states that my credit was refused because the purchase was made on XX/XX/year>. This response clearly ignored my original message with the time stamp proof. 

Since receiving the two conflicting and inaccurate responses, I have tried calling Chase multiple times and have spoken to several Chase representatives who have been unable to help me, despite verbally agreeing that the responses from Chase were erroneous. During those discussions, representatives have said that they would transfer me to a supervisor only to put me on hold for another thirty minutes, send me to an automated line stating a wait time of over 30 minutes, and send me to another representative who simply makes me file another escalation as Ive already done once. I have also sent multiple messages via the Chase app, and nobody has responded to me. 

In conclusion, despite verbal acknowledgment from Chase representatives that I am owed a {$100.00} credit, Chase Card Services has failed to truthfully and adequately respond to my complaint in writing, citing several conflicting and erroneous reasons for failing to credit my account in accordance with an advertised promotion on their application ; and is currently refusing any timely help or rectification to this issue, including the issuance of the {$100.00} credit that I am legally owed.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,VA,22202,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,In progress,Yes,,11073007

Shortly after, I was alerted that there had been a hard inquiry on my credit report by Discover. 

I have checked my rates and loan options and have gotten numerous "" pre-approved '' offers for credit/loans. No other company has needed to make a hard inquiry to show me my loan options and rates, even when they have asked, and I've consented for them to obtain a copy of my credit report. They have all been soft inquiries. 

Discover is the only company that for a pre approval has pulled a hard inquiry ... before any other portion of the application has been submitted. 

Discover failed to make it clear that I was consenting to a hard inquiry. I think at best this is negligence on their part, and at worst is a deceptive business practice to pin people into continuing with an application.

Two days before the flight in XX/XX/year>, XXXX received an email from XXXX XXXX telling her ( at first ) that her flight was cancelled, and then when she questioned why, that her reservations were cancelled. They then attempted to extort her by telling her if she would pay them an additional {$750.00}, they would refund her charge. 

Realizing she had been scammed, she went to the XXXX  site ( could not reach anyone in real time because they don't have phone service ) and saw that her reservations had indeed been made but cancelled by the passenger, that is XXXX XXXX XXXX. In the XXXX  documents sent, we can read the line entries closely and see that part of the scheme must have included using false surnames. Those were the names used on the cancellation notices which we have taken screen shots of to submit as evidence, ( see documents submitted ). It seems XXXX XXXX was able to bypass the verification code that XXXX requested before cancelling the flight. 

Although XXXX claims that their verification code provides security that the right person is cancelling, in our case the security failed as it was XXXX XXXX they were communicating with, and XXXX XXXX was cancelling using our credit card and phone information. XXXX allows bookings to be made by XXXX XXXX. There are 22 complaints against XXXX XXXX of similar scams on XXXX XXXX XXXX site . XXXX must have had similar experiences with XXXX XXXX before. 

Since the surnames did not match passport info, or for some other reason, it was XXXX which actually cancelled our reservationsat the request of XXXX XXXX.

We disputed the charge. Capital One refunded while they "" investigated ''. We sent pages of documentation. When XXXX answered with their defense, Capital One closed the case, returned the charge to my card, and said to take it up with XXXX.

Dear Cross Country Mortgage, See Attachment Please be advised that this email is in response to a letter I received on XX/XX/XXXX requesting PROOF OF HOME INSURANCE FOR THE MONTHS OF XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX IMMEDIATELY. 

Cross Country Mortgage/ Insurance , I would like to take this time to express the unprofessional and unjust behavior that I have experienced by your organization. Back around XXXX of XXXX, my wife and I entered a contractual agreement with your organization, by way of a mortgage, and in said agreement, XXXX XXXX XXXX was our chosen Home Insurance provider. Cross Country Mortgage, Insurance, you were responsible for paying my homeowner insurance policy Fast forward to the end of XXXX XXXX of XXXX, Cross Country Mortgage Insurance XXXX you failed to pay my home insurance policy, resulting in XXXX  XXXX XXXX canceling my home insurance. I, the consumer, found out that my home insurance was cancelled in XX/XX/XXXX after XXXX XXXX XXXX sent a check to my address with the cancellation information. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX demanding answers to why my policy was cancelled and their response was, "" XXXX XXXX your mortgage company Cross Country Mortgage paid your home insurance policy XXXX days late and we were forced to cancel your policy in XX/XX/XXXX ''. I then called "" You '', Cross Country Mortgage Insurance, and informed you that my Homeowners Insurance policy had been canceled due to Your late payment. You then informed me that your organization attempted to reach out to XXXX XXXX XXXX for the updated insurance policy information and received said information in XXXX of XXXX and that's when you rendered payment. Cross Country Mortgage Insurance, you never reached out to me/ the homeowner requesting said information, despite your Standard Operating Procedures, instead, after my call to you in XX/XX/XXXX, you then send a letter stating that if I do not have homeowner Insurance XXXX will be place by you which will result in a higher cost! My wife and I worked tirelessly to obtain a replacement homeowner insurance policy, despite numerous companies denying us due to our lapse in our previous policy. Because of your actions, we had to purchase a policy that was double the cost of our original one and to add insult to injury you sent us a second letter stating that you need proof of insurance from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

Cross Country Mortgage Insurance : Federal law requires the servicer to make insurance payments on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty, as long as your mortgage payment is not more than 30 days overdue. This law also states that, "" If your mortgage company 's late payments cause a lapse in your insurance coverage, they could be liable for any damages that would have been covered if your policy had remained in place. '' In closing, Cross Country Mortgage Insurance, it is very apparent that You are unwilling to bear any transparency in this situation, even after I communicated this information to numerous representatives/ supervisors and requested reimbursement, You are still unwilling to reimburse me for the difference in premium/ policy payments. Because of this fact, I am forced to report this to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where I will be filing my official complaint in hopes of being made whole after your unjust practices that have resulted in financial hardship.",,CrossCountry Mortgage LLC,NJ,08096,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11071108

Which has been a little over 2 months now and hours of my life wasted on the phone. I have other accounts with Ally ( checking, savings, credit card ) and thought this would be a seamless process. I was wrong. I have made it to their highest level of customer service and there is no urgency to fix my account. Every time I call I am told the person handling my case will contact me, which still hasn't happened after three weeks now. Meanwhile, interest/late charges accrue and they are telling me nothing can be done about that. The only other options given to pay ( mail/phone ) come with extra fees or lead to higher finance charges. This is unacceptable and I feel like I am being taken advantage of. They literally advertise in the welcome packet to download the app/create an account to have access to above stated information and pay whichever way is most convenient. I have the call logs on my phone of when I started to call, how often, and how long I spent on the phone.

According to 15usc 1681e ( b ) it states this ( b ) accuracy of report Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedure to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

So I then asked them to provide me a description of the investigation according to 15 usc 1681i ( 7 ) : ( 7 ) description of reinvestigation procedure. A consumer reporting agency shall provide to a consumer a description referred to in a paragraph ( 6 ) ( b ) ( iii ) by not later than 15 days after receiving a request from the consumer for that description.

But they did not do that as well either.

They also are breaking these laws as well below 15 usc 1681i ( 5 ) it states this ( 5 ) treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information ( A ) in general If, after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any information disputed by a consumer an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified the consumer reporting agency shall..

( I ) promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer or modify that item of information as appropriate based on the results of the reinvestigation and ( ii ) promptly notify the furnisher of that information that the information has been modified or deleted from the file of the consumer According to 15 usc 1681s-2 it states this ( A ) reporting information with actual knowledge of errors This is unfair and if they doing it to me imagine who else they are doing this too.

2. The identity of the entity or individual who authorized LexisNexis to include this information in my file.
