2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding inaccurate and adverse information that has been reported on my credit report. Despite my efforts to resolve this matter with the consumer reporting agencies, XXXX, Experian, and XXXX. My private information continues to appear on my credit file in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am seeking your assistance in rectifying this issue.

1. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b and 15 U.S.C. 1681a, consumer reporting agencies are prohibited from furnishing information without the express consent of the consumer. I have not given written consent for the reporting of the account in question, nor have I authorized the financial institution that furnished this information to report it to the credit bureaus. In fact, I have revoked any such consent, as outlined below.

2. Revocation of Consent As of the date of this letter, I am formally revoking any and all consent, whether implied or explicit, to the furnishing of this information to the credit reporting agencies. I have not provided any written consent for this account to be reported. This revocation is in full accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), which requires written consent from the consumer for information to be furnished to a consumer reporting agency. As such, I request that this information be immediately removed from my credit report.

3. Failure to Inform Me of My Rights Furthermore, the furnisher of the information,, has never informed me of my right to exercise my non-disclosure option as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ). This failure to inform me of my rights violates the obligations placed upon them by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I was not notified that I could object to or limit the disclosure of this account to consumer reporting agencies, as mandated under 12 CFR 1016.7.

4. Adverse Information Continues to Be Reported Without Consent Despite my objections and revocation of consent, the adverse account information has continued to be reported by the credit bureaus, which constitutes a further violation of the FCRA. As stated in 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602, "" There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. '' The continued reporting of this account, despite the lack of my consent, represents a failure to uphold these responsibilities.

5. Request for Immediate Action I made an attempt to resolve this issue directly by sending written notice of these issues to XXXX, Experian, and XXXX on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX However, the information has not been removed. As such, I am now seeking the assistance of the CFPB to rectify this matter.In 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) states '' Except as authorized under subsection ( b ), no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information any other adverse item of information, other than records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than seven years. '' This account is an adverse item they are reporting without my permission.

I have attached copies of all relevant documentation, including some of my correspondence with the credit reporting agencies, as well as any relevant account details. I look forward to your investigation and resolution of this matter.

Thank you for your time and attention to this important issue.

2024-12-21,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Unfair Account Closure and Charges To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a complaint against Capital One for unfairly charging me fees and closing my account after I made efforts to pay off my balance. My account was in good standing with a consistent history of on time payments. The situation has caused financial and emotional distress, and I believe their actions were unjustified.

Details of the Issue 1. Account Closure : Capital One closed my account after claiming a returned payment violated their terms. However, the returned payment occurred due to processing delays beyond my control.

2. Payment Made : Prior to the account closure, I paid {$800.00} toward my balance. {$500.00} one card and {$300.00} on the other card. Despite this payment, Capital One charged me for an overdraft and additional fees after the account was closed.

3. Lack of Transparency : When I contacted Capital One for clarification, they refused to acknowledge how their processing times contributed to the returned payment. When I viewed mu account in the app, I noticed my accounts were restricted. I called the company on December 19th and was told it was closed due to fraud that someone reported. As the only authorized user on the account, and having not reported of credit card being lost or stolen, I was taken aback. They have closed my account without an investigation and giving proper notice.

Why I Believe This Is Unfair The returned payment resulted from a delay in processing, not from insufficient funds or any deliberate fault on my part. The payments cleared with my bank account.

I made a good-faith effort to pay my balance, and the account closure and subsequent fees penalized me unfairly.

Capital One has not provided adequate justification or documentation to support these charges or their decision to close my account. 


Resolution Requested A refund of the overdraft and any additional fees charged after the account closure. 

An acknowledgment of how processing times contributed to the issue. 

A review of Capital Ones policies regarding returned payments and account closures to ensure fairness for other customers. 


I hope the CFPB will investigate this matter to prevent similar issues for other consumers. Please let me know if you need further details or documentation to proceed with this complaint. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

2024-12-21,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I made a {$1500.00} payment to my Chase Freedom credit card from my XXXX checking account using my Chase mobile app. The payment was posted to my account the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), but my available credit did not increase. I waited until the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), at which point the {$1500.00} debit from my XXXX checking had hard posted. It had now been a full business day since I'd initiated the payment, and both the credit ( Chase ) and the debit ( XXXX  ) were hard posted as final transactions on both accounts, with matching transaction Ids/reference numbers. Still, my available credit remained the same. 

I attempted to use my Chase Freedom card to pay for something yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and it was declined ; upon checking my account, my available credit had still not been updated. I thought this must be an error, as I hadn't received any emails, calls, texts, or other communications from Chase alerting me to any issues with my account. 
With my available credit still unchanged by the time I found a break in my workday this evening ( Friday, XX/XX/XXXX ), I called to find out what was going on. The first representative I spoke to acted rather strange during the call. He stammered for a few minutes about needing to check my account, and kept saying he 'needed to make sure this is really what's happening ' before he could tell me what was happening ... as if he was unfamiliar and/or surprised with what he was seeing. When he finally decided to tell me what the problem was, he stated that my payment 'has been placed on hold for review and would not be released until XX/XX/XXXX. I expressed my confusion ( and displeasure ) at hearing this and asked why it was being held, even though it had cleared the funding account and hard posted to the credit account. He mumbled something about it being Chase policy to sometimes review large payments, and I again asked why it needed to continue to be reviewed for a full week, even after clearing both accounts. He then answered with a slightly different response, stating that it was because mine was a newer account and ACH payments take several days to clear. 

After arguing about how awful and incredibly inconvenient it is for them to be doing this the weekend before XXXX, I asked to speak with a supervisor, who just repeated the same non-answers as the previous representative. ( This time, however, I was told that my payment would be held for review until XX/XX/XXXX as opposed to XX/XX/XXXX. ) I pointed out that my Chase checking account had a regular balance of $ XXXX, which is more than enough to cover my payment ( 3 times over! ). He asked if I had made this payment from my Chase checking account, to which I said no, because thats not the account I pay bills from. His response was that the accounts were not connected, so my Chase checking balance had no bearing on my Chase credit card status. ( This doesn't add up, for two reasons : 1. He asked if Id made the payment from a Chase account, implying that it DOES have some bearing on payment posting, and 2. I had asked him at one point why my first card payment had cleared immediately, as opposed to being held, and he said that it was because I HAD paid with my Chase checking account. ) At this point I said that they needed to either release my funds back to my XXXX account, or update my available credit. His response was that Chase was not in receipt of the funds, and he claimed he did not have the ability or power to override the hold, nor did he have access to anyone who did. Again, I do not believe this to be true, being that there are matching transaction IDs on both the Chase credit and the XXXX debit, since Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX. I also asked why I had not received any communication from Chase about the fact that my {$1500.00} was being held in limbo for an entire week, and he replied, 'yes you did, it's in your cardmember agreement '. 

The cardmember agreement states : As long as you make your payment in accordance with the instructions on your billing statement by the date and time payments are due, we will credit your payment as of the same day it is received. 

The Chase mobile app, on the final screen when making a payment, states : If youre paying between XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  ET, well credit your account for the date you choose, but you might not see it for 1 to 2 days. 

My due date is not until XX/XX/XXXX and my minimum payment due for this month was only {$40.00}. I already made a payment of {$250.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which was posted immediately, and I've had an automatic monthly payment of {$200.00} set to pay on the due date since I opened the account, which is to be paid on top of any pre-arranged 'Pay Over Time ' payment amounts.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XX/XX/2024 Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Inaccurate Late Payment Reporting Dear CFPB, I am filing a formal complaint against Experian for failing to correct inaccurate information regarding late payments reported on my credit report. Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/2024 and XX/XX/2024 ), no changes have been made to resolve this issue, in violation of both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the errors remain on my credit report. 
FCRA Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors must send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement.

15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files. This obligation has not been upheld in my case. 
TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to provide accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The incorrect reporting of late payments has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The reported late payments for this account are inconsistent and inaccurate across different months and reporting periods. Specific discrepancies include : Late payments reported for months where no late payments occurred. 
Different late payment statuses reported across credit bureaus. 
Dates of delinquency that do not align with the accounts actual payment history. 
These errors significantly misrepresent my credit history and have negatively impacted my creditworthiness.

Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report.

Written confirmation of the correction.

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant agencies. 
I look forward to your prompt response to this matter. Please send confirmation of the corrections to the address provided above.

I believe banks/collection agencies use tools to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX / find other possible addresses to send collection notices. When they did this, they also reported these addresses that aren't mine. Regardless of however they came up with these addresses- they aren't mine.

Below is a summary of the actions I have taken and the ongoing issues with XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX handling of my personal information and credit reporting. 

Timeline of Events and Actions Taken : Debt Validation Letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent XXXX XXXX XXXX a Debt Validation letter requesting validation of the alleged debt they are attempting to collect. This is my right under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). The letter explicitly requested that XXXX XXXX XXXX provide verification of the debt, including the original creditor, the amount, and other relevant details. 
No response was received from XXXX XXXX XXXX within the required XXXX period. This lack of response is a violation of my rights under the FDCPA, which mandates that they must provide this validation before continuing any collection activities. 
Cease and Desist Letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a Cease and Desist letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX, demanding that they immediately stop accessing or reporting my personal information to credit bureaus without my consent. 
This letter also reiterated my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), which requires consumer consent before any third party can access or report my credit information. I have not given XXXX XXXX XXXX permission to obtain or report my personal or credit information. 
Despite this request, no response has been received from XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they continue to report inaccurate and unauthorized information on my credit report. 

Key Issues : Unauthorized Access and Reporting : XXXX XXXX XXXX has been reporting on my credit report without my consent. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b, they are not permitted to obtain my personal information or report it to credit bureaus without my explicit permission. Their actions are not only a violation of my privacy rights but may also constitute identity theft. 
Failure to Respond : Both my Debt Validation letter and my Cease and Desist letter were sent in good faith, requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX provide the necessary documentation and cease their unauthorized actions. However, as of today, they have failed to respond to either request, which further compounds the violation of my rights. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this complaint and confirmation that XXXX XXXX XXXX is taking the appropriate corrective actions.

Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year> ), my requests have been ignored, violating both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the inaccuracies persist.

FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The absence of detailed reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement.

Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files, which has not been upheld in my case.

Reporting incomplete information violates 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, which prohibits the omission of essential data regarding accounts.

Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : Missing account details such as balances, high credit limit, and payment history.

No reported late payments ; however, the omission of critical account information creates inconsistencies in my credit profile.

Impact on Creditworthiness : The lack of comprehensive and accurate information in my XXXX report has created discrepancies across credit bureaus, undermining my creditworthiness and leading to financial harm. 
Desired Resolution : Immediate inclusion of all relevant account details in my credit report.

Written confirmation of the updates.

Assurance that the reporting will be accurate and consistent moving forward.

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with relevant agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).

Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/XXXX  and XX/XX/XXXX  ), my requests have been ignored, violating both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the inaccuracies persist. 
FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The absence of detailed reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. 
Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files, which has not been upheld in my case. 
Reporting incomplete information violates 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, which prohibits the omission of essential data regarding accounts. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : Missing account details such as balances, high credit limit, and payment history. 
No reported late payments ; however, the omission of critical account information creates inconsistencies in my credit profile. 
Impact on Creditworthiness : The lack of comprehensive and accurate information in my XXXX report has created discrepancies across credit bureaus, undermining my creditworthiness and leading to financial harm. 
Desired Resolution : Immediate inclusion of all relevant account details in my credit report. 
Written confirmation of the updates. 
Assurance that the reporting will be accurate and consistent moving forward. 
If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with relevant agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).

Despite my submission of the required documentation, including the FTC Fraud Affidavit, drivers license, and proof of address, Experian has failed to remove the unauthorized accounts listed below from my consumer credit report : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have both complied with my disputes and removed unauthorized accounts, yet Experian continues to willfully neglect federal law, thereby displaying fraudulent intent to harm my creditworthiness and financial reputation. 

Experians back-office team has demonstrated a shocking level of inconsistency and outright negligence in their handling of my disputes. While you were able to remove all XXXX accounts within four business daysproving that you are fully capable of complying with federal law when it suits your interestsyou have willfully failed to do the same for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This deliberate disregard for the law and my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) highlights not only your incompetence but also a blatant fraudulent intent to misrepresent my creditworthiness. Such selective compliance exposes the predatory practices of your back-office team, who seem more concerned with protecting financial institutions than fulfilling your legal duty to consumers. If you can act swiftly in one instance, your failure to do so here is nothing but a calculated decision to inflict financial harm for profit, which raises serious questions of racketeering and profiteering off my personal and financial distress.

Violations of Federal Law 1. 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Failure to Maintain Reasonable Procedures for Accuracy Experian is legally required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum accuracy in the reporting of consumer information. The continued inclusion of unauthorized and fraudulent accounts on my credit report, despite receiving sufficient documentation, is a gross violation of this obligation. 
2. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) Failure to Conduct a Proper Reinvestigation You have failed to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of my disputes, despite being provided with clear evidence that these accounts are unauthorized. Federal law mandates that reinvestigations must be completed within 30 days. Your blatant disregard of this statutory duty constitutes willful non-compliance.

3. 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) Reporting Without a Permissible Purpose By continuing to report fraudulent accounts without my consent, Experian is disseminating inaccurate information to third parties without a permissible purpose, in direct violation of federal law.

4. RICO Violations Profiteering from Financial Harm Your refusal to remove these unauthorized accounts and your delay in resolving this matter further demonstrates fraudulent intent under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ). By knowingly disseminating false information, you are profiting from the harm caused to my financial standing, including higher interest rates, reduced credit opportunities, and reputational damage.

5. Fraudulent Misrepresentation of Creditworthiness Experians back-office leadership has willfully ignored its duty to address and resolve this matter. This pattern of negligence and fraudulent misrepresentation is designed to benefit financially at my expense. Your actions violate my constitutional rights and cause demonstrable harm to my financial health. 
Supporting Precedent Experians refusal to comply mirrors a history of systemic non-compliance as evidenced in : FTC v. Experian Information Solutions , Inc. ( XXXX ) Highlighting Experians negligence in providing accurate information to consumers. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Demonstrating how credit reporting agencies fail to follow reasonable procedures, resulting in consumer harm. 
Your actionsor lack thereofare indicative of Experians pattern of disregarding federal law and consumer protections. 
Immediate Demands I am granting Experian one final opportunity to comply with federal law by taking the following actions within 15 days of receipt of this letter : 1. Immediately and permanently delete the following unauthorized accounts from my consumer report XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Provide written confirmation of the removal of these accounts and a detailed explanation of how Experian will ensure compliance moving forward. 
Legal and Regulatory Consequences Failure to comply will result in the following actions : 1. Complaints filed with the CFPB and FTC for ongoing FCRA violations and intentional misconduct.

2. Civil action under 15 U.S.C. 1681n for willful non-compliance, including statutory damages of {$1000.00} per violation, actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees.

3. Exposing Experians back-office leadership under RICO statutes for fraudulent misrepresentation and profiteering from consumer harm.

I have previously notified you of the inaccuracies, yet no corrective action has been taken. This ongoing violation of federal law demonstrates negligence and disregard for your legal responsibilities. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, you are legally obligated to ensure that all information you report is accurate, complete, and verifiable. Specifically : 1 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Credit reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy in the information they report. 
2 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) : Upon notice of a dispute, you are required to conduct a prompt and thorough reinvestigation to verify or remove the contested information. 
3 15 U.S.C. 1681n : Noncompliance with the FCRA subjects you to civil liability, including actual damages, statutory damages of {$1000.00} per violation, punitive damages, and attorney fees. 
In addition to your violations of the FCRA, multiple court rulings have affirmed the illegality of reporting inaccurate or unverified child support accounts to credit bureaus : XXXX XXXX XXXX United States ( XXXX ) : The court ruled that the federal government wrongfully reported XXXX XXXX arrears to credit bureaus and ordered the records expunged. 
XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : The court found that the XXXX XXXX agency violated the paying parents due process rights by reporting arrears without proper notice. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : The court reversed a decision to report XXXX XXXX arrears due to a lack of evidence and improper procedures. 

I have solid evidence that the XXXX XXXX account information you are reporting is false and was provided without proper verification or notice. I have never provided my consent for this account to be reported, which is an additional violation of my rights. 

As a result of your continued failure to comply with federal law, I have suffered significant harm, including financial damages and emotional distress. Therefore, I am demanding : 1 Immediate removal of the inaccurate XXXX XXXX  account from my credit report. 
2 Payment of {$1000.00} in statutory damages per bureau for failing to comply with the FCRA, payable to me at the address listed above. 

If you fail to comply with this demand, I will have no choice but to initiate litigation against all three credit bureaus for willful violations of the FCRA and associated damages. In court, I will seek the maximum allowable damages, including statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees. 

This is your final notice. I strongly urge you to take this matter seriously and fulfill your legal obligations. Contact me via email only.

Summary of Errors : Different Account Numbers : The account numbers reported by XXXX and Experian do not match, causing further inconsistencies. 
Inconsistent Account Rating : XXXX reports the account as "" Closed, '' while Experian lists it as "" Paid. '' Missing Closing Date : Experian has not provided a closing date for the account, making it unclear when the account was finalized. 
Inconsistent Creditor Remarks : XXXX includes remarks indicating the account is "" Closed, '' while Experian does not provide any such remarks, adding to the lack of clarity and accuracy. 
These discrepancies, along with the erroneous late payment entries, highlight a significant failure to ensure accurate reporting and adherence to federal regulations. 
Evidence of Error : The reported late payments on this account for the following months are inaccurate and unsupported : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX These payments were either made on time or the account was in deferment during these periods, as documented by my records from the US Department of Education. Despite submitting evidence of deferment status and timely payments in my first dispute, the inaccuracies remain uncorrected. 
Violations of My Consumer Rights : 1. Unauthorized Reporting and Privacy Violation : Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my financial information. The US Department of Educations reporting of this account without a permissible purpose is a violation of my rights. Furthermore, 15 USC 6801 mandates the protection of my personal financial data, which has been breached by reporting erroneous late payments.

2. Willful Noncompliance : The failure to correct these inaccuracies despite documented proof provided in my first dispute constitutes willful noncompliance under 15 USC 1681n, entitling me to damages.

3. Defamation and Emotional Distress : The erroneous reporting has caused significant harm to my reputation and mental well-being, amounting to defamation. 
Requested Action : I request the immediate correction of the following : Removal of all late payments reported for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Updates to reflect the accurate deferment status during these periods. 
Written confirmation that these corrections have been made. 
Failure to resolve this issue within 10 calendar days will result in further escalation, including potential legal action and additional complaints to relevant authorities. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Specifically, I question whether the entity reporting these late payments had a permissible purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as codified in 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ), to access and report this information.

Under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ), a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only under specific circumstances that constitute a permissible purpose. These purposes include, but are not limited to, transactions initiated by the consumer, employment considerations, or other legitimate needs as defined by law. If the entity reporting these late payments accessed or shared my information outside these parameters, they may have violated federal law.

The late payments in question are associated with the following account ( s ) : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Date ( s ) of Late Payment ( s ) : XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX I request that you investigate this matter promptly. Please verify whether the reporting entity had a permissible purpose to access and furnish this information and provide me with documentation supporting their compliance with the FCRA. If the reporting can not be verified or is found to lack a permissible purpose, I demand that these entries be deleted from my credit report immediately.

Furthermore, I request that you notify me of the results of your investigation, as well as any changes made to my credit report, within the time frame prescribed by law.

For your reference, I have attached a copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed entries, along with copies of relevant supporting documentation, including proof of identity.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Summary of Errors : Different Account Numbers : The account numbers reported by XXXX and Experian do not match, causing further inconsistencies. 
Inconsistent Account Rating : XXXX reports the account as "" Closed, '' while Experian lists it as "" Paid. '' Missing Closing Date : Experian has not provided a closing date for the account, making it unclear when the account was finalized. 
Inconsistent Creditor Remarks : XXXX includes remarks indicating the account is "" Closed, '' while Experian does not provide any such remarks, adding to the lack of clarity and accuracy. 
These discrepancies, along with the erroneous late payment entries, highlight a significant failure to ensure accurate reporting and adherence to federal regulations. 
Evidence of Error : The reported late payments on this account for the following months are inaccurate and unsupported : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX These payments were either made on time or the account was in deferment during these periods, as documented by my records from the US Department of Education.

Violations of My Consumer Rights : 1. Unauthorized Reporting and Privacy Violation : Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my financial information.

Furthermore, 15 USC 6801 mandates the protection of my personal financial data, which has been breached by reporting erroneous late payments. 
2. Willful Noncompliance : The failure to correct these inaccuracies despite documented proof provided in my first dispute constitutes willful noncompliance under 15 USC 1681n, entitling me to damages.

3. Defamation and Emotional Distress : The erroneous reporting has caused significant harm to my reputation and mental well-being, amounting to defamation. 
Requested Action : I request the immediate correction of the following : Removal of all late payments reported for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XX/XX/year> Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Inaccurate Late Payment Reporting Dear CFPB, I am filing a formal complaint against Experian for failing to correct inaccurate information regarding late payments reported on my credit report. Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year> ), no changes have been made to resolve this issue, in violation of both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the errors remain on my credit report. 
FCRA Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors must send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. 
15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files. This obligation has not been upheld in my case. 
TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to provide accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The incorrect reporting of late payments has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The reported late payments for this account are inconsistent and inaccurate across different months and reporting periods. Specific discrepancies include : Late payments reported for months where no late payments occurred. 
Different late payment statuses reported across credit bureaus. 
Dates of delinquency that do not align with the accounts actual payment history. 
These errors significantly misrepresent my credit history and have negatively impacted my creditworthiness. 
Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report. 
Written confirmation of the correction. 
If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant agencies. 
I look forward to your prompt response to this matter. Please send confirmation of the corrections to the address provided above.

Summary of Errors : Different Account Numbers : The account numbers reported by XXXX and Experian do not match, causing further inconsistencies. 
Inconsistent Account Rating : XXXX reports the account as "" Closed, '' while Experian lists it as "" Paid. '' Missing Closing Date : Experian has not provided a closing date for the account, making it unclear when the account was finalized. 
Inconsistent Creditor Remarks : XXXX includes remarks indicating the account is "" Closed, '' while Experian does not provide any such remarks, adding to the lack of clarity and accuracy. 
These discrepancies, along with the erroneous late payment entries, highlight a significant failure to ensure accurate reporting and adherence to federal regulations. 
Evidence of Error : The reported late payments on this account for the following months are inaccurate and unsupported : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX These payments were either made on time or the account was in deferment during these periods, as documented by my records from the US Department of Education.

2024-12-21,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,"Over 1 month ago I asked if I could close my bank account over the phone instead of going inside the branch. They said yes. During the closing of the account, however I had been mistakingly auto debited for my car payment ( even though it was already taken out of another account, so I was dinged twice ), so I requested a stop payment on this item. I also requested a stop payment on an unauthorized charge from a doctor ( for {$300.00} ). They told me it would take a little while for the stop payments to go through and then the account would close. After several weeks of my account still being open, I went into the branch and asked if I could please withdraw my money from the account. The teller was told by BOA that I could if they reopened my account again from its closing status, and then close it again. After trying to do this BOA on the phone ( fraud dept ) said no, we can not do this for you because its in a closed status. I asked how long until the account would close since they originally told me 10 business days and it had now been 3 full weeks. She said she did not know but it would be the end of that week. This was 2 weeks ago. My account is still open, it still shows a balance of {$450.00} and I have not received my check for the funds in my account. I need my money back now!!!

I reported the initial known charges to PayPal on their app. I am not sure why they did not take precautions to seize the account and file for charges to be temporally frozen, to protect me at the time of incident. In my app linked charges I messaged that the account was fraudulently initiated and that spammers had accessed my account via an app called XXXX assist. PayPal wanted me to file each complaint, and I could not keep up as I had to file complaints with local law enforcement and then to federal agencies. I was diligent and took screen shots as I could from my I phone to provide evidence to the parties involved. It has been a good faithed effort as wording my compliant in a matter which will be enforced by supporting laws will further my claim. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX is a service provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX.

I did, but the cost of battery was not worth destroying my phone, In XX/XX/XXXX, my husbands and my iPhones died the same night, and we were forced to go to XXXX and trade them in. I did not have any time to research carriers. XXXX was out of the question as they wanted {$800.00} to set up. XXXX was {$220.00} set up for XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
There have been little recommendations by XXXX or XXXX and XXXX to set the settings to the most secure. One would assume but I know this phone is not and I do not know enough to want to mess with it. 
That set aside, I have not knowingly altered any features which should cause the phone to become vulnerable. I do not even know if I should use XXXX or XXXX to search web. XXXX always recommends XXXX to better ensure their customers are safe. I did not search on XXXX app to find XXXX customer Support number that day, I searched on XXXX and the XXXX  generated a number, and I called it. I did not even look further as the XXXX generated response is what I used. Funny for me, I had called the real XXXX about 2 years ago with my XXXX, and I got useful information. I had the XXXX Customer Support number in my old phone, but apple somehow only ported over most of my numbers but not all. The one is that were missing have been important and infrequently noticed by me as they were important because I saved them to be sure I had the information later. I tried to call the XXXX customer support number in my contacts and only the contacts name was there, and XXXX could not seem to port their own device over to upgrade. Worst of all, when I switched from android to XXXX in XXXX my android ported everything to that little XXXX no problem. Not true with XXXX XXXX XXXX. My old XXXX XXXX was left with no support from XXXX about XXXX years ago and I was forced to by XXXX. The computer does not even function as stand alone. Since XXXX, I always wanted a XXXX so I could experience XXXX band. My XXXX had better sound because it had real us ports to carry the digital signal to the XXXX. My new one I like a lot, but XXXX ruined the inputs for mixing in. My old music is not available as the computer did not have enough app support to save to, I cloud so my new one would have. XXXX lab is free, and next computer is up in the air. 
I feel so violated because XXXX products are expensive, their customer support on devices in the past was great, but after this experience I do not love XXXX anymore. I pray XXXX reconciles this and protects me and my family and treats my complaint seriously. 
On the morning which I called for XXXX customer support, I was only trying to be sure that I documented the possible damages from shipping which were not covered by seller, they were covered by XXXX money back guarantee. They did not use to do that and so I never use to purchase items that did not have a free return policy. 
I was trusting apple to provide me with appropriate XXXX search for XXXX customer support and so I called XXXX per XXXX web generated answer on my XXXX app. I could not get the app to generate the same answer after that as I tried to get URL. I felt safe enough to check web history last night for URL complaints, but XXXX erased my activity from XX/XX/XXXX. There is second search on XXXX initiated by perpetrator. 
The charge is in error because my accounts were breached by a Technician from XXXX XXXX. I have all the transactions and other information which shows the perpetrator which using application to breach my PayPal and he was able to see the codes from my messenger. He was extremely interested in my apple wallet. I felt like I was being cyber hacked and cyberstalked because persons where there waiting to intercept my looking up XXXX and how to fie concern. 
I am writing to dispute a charge of {$3400.00} to my PayPal account from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX. I reported the charges to PayPal, but they did not take immediate action to protect my account. The charges were initiated fraudulently through an app called XXXX XXXX, which I accessed via XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. Despite my efforts to report the issue to local law enforcement and federal agencies, PayPal required me to file each complaint individually, making it difficult to keep up. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX is managed by XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX. I trusted XXXX with my new XXXX XXXX, believing their claims of safety and security. However, my XXXX XXXX XXXX was compromised, and I feel XXXX did not provide adequate guidance on securing my device. My previous XXXX XXXX had no issues, but the batteries died after XXXX years, forcing me to upgrade. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, both my husband 's and my iPhones died, and we had to switch to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX provided little guidance on securing our new devices. I used XXXX to search for XXXX customer support and called a number generated by AI, which led to the fraudulent charges. XXXX erased my web history from XX/XX/XXXX, making it difficult to trace the issue. 

I feel violated and disappointed with XXXX 's lack of support and security. I pray XXXX takes my complaint seriously and protects me and my family The original number I called was XXXX. Later that day, I contacted local law enforcement per XXXXXXXX XXXXs recommendation and was directed to the FBI. I sent an email supporting that they wouldnt take jurisdiction at the time. This complaint will be forwarded to the XXXX  and the credit bureau and enforced by civil suit, if necessary, due to the loss of credit and potential legal losses. 

Last night, I filed another complaint with the FBI and finally reached the real XXXX. I emailed all parties involved and sent an updated complaint to the FBI now that PayPal has provided the banking information. To this point, XXXX has failed to provide any recourse or accountability. XXXX is negligent, and XXXX is liable for not providing a disclaimer in their app. XXXX supports XXXX by allowing their app in the XXXX XXXX and recommending XXXX for safe browsing. Both negligent actions occurred by following recommended courses, and XXXX is almost maliciously negligent by not providing an XXXX line for all consumers. 

XXXX XXXX litigation The action is citing XXXX XXXX 's litigation generally involves intellectual property disputes, but the company has also been a party in lawsuits that include antitrust claims, consumer actions, commercial unfair trade practice suits, defamation claims, and corporate espionage, among other matters. Examples include harassment related to debt collection, predatory lending, and deceptive trade practices. I believe all the malicious negligence has occurred due to large companies expecting no one to follow through with filing proper complaints, as it is traumatizing. I will follow through and expect XXXX to cover the loss and reconcile with the other companies. I have recommended XXXX products to my friends and acquaintances, but if this issue isnt dealt with appropriately, I will bring a civil suit to reconcile my loss and prevent further loss and deception of others in the future.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Apparently, XXXX XXXX XXXX opened a credit card account in my name without properly verifying the actual applicant. I don't recall how I actually became aware of the account a couple of years ago ( likely I saw a credit report ). I contacted XXXX when I became aware of the account and well after it was in default. XXXX confirmed over the phone that it did not have my correct contact information in its records until I reached out to them to let them know that I never opened any account with them. XXXX however refuses to correct its error that it should not have opened the account to begin with. I called XXXX several times and also wrote them a couple of letters explaining everything to them, but they refuse to change anything. XXXX has continued to damage my credit by reporting the account as mine, which became delinquent which they eventually wrote-off. 

XXXX was completely negligent in how it issued the credit card. If it had bothered to confirm an email address or confirm a phone number, it would have known it had incorrect information, or at least have some way to trace who really opened the account. How it is possible a card issuer would not bother to at least verify contact information for someone applying for credit? And why is such a high burden placed on an innocent party to correct a card issuer 's mistake? There don't seem to be any consequences to XXXX for its negligence or unwillingness to correct its mistake, but I suffer the consequences of destroyed credit. 

After trying to get XXXX to correct the error, I reached out the credit reporting services to see if they could correct the reporting. XXXX "" investigated '' and somehow "" verified as accurate '' the debt, but it would be impossible to confirm that it is my debt because it is not mine. ( My appeal was received the same letter in response. The "" Adverse '' information of the delinquency will remain on XXXX 's reporting until XX/XX/XXXX unless some action is taken. ) As part of the XXXX XXXX, I noticed another credit card account with XXXX  XXXX that I had been completely unaware of. When I called XXXX, they were unable to find any record of any account in my name or with my SS #. When I asked how is possible then that a delinquent account from XXXX would show up as "" Adverse Information '' on my credit report, the rep did not have an answer. The XXXX rep on the phone seemed like she would be taking action to correct the problem, but I don't know what is happening. ( I only discovered the XXXX account issue this week even though the account was opened in XXXX. My credit report shows the negative information will not be removed until XX/XX/XXXX unless something is done. ) In XX/XX/XXXX, I filed an Identity Theft statement with the FTC and sent it to XXXX and XXXX. I spoke with XXXX again by phone earlier this week, provided all the information again, but nothing has changed. The representative suggested I file a complaint with the CFPB, which is what I am doing now. 

I am guessing my name an SS # were part of a data leak ( likely through the Government Personnel Office who did a background check on me and whose data breach was massive is widely known ). Whatever the source, data leaks are extremely common and credit issuers should know this and take basic steps to confirm someone's identity before issuing credit ( the CFPB did more to confirm my contact information to use this website than the credit card issuers did for whoever opened these accounts in my name. ) In a more just world, the burden would not be placed on the victims to correct the problems that occur through credit card companies being negligent in their processes. In an even more just world there would be fines or class action suits for all the harm they cause by doing this. I am sure I am not the only one whose credit has been ruined by these bogus accounts. Despite my excellent record on my actual credit accounts, these relatively small fraud items are killers. I did not do anything wrong, but the burden is on me to keep calling giant and uncaring institutions, dealing with their automated replies, writing new letters in response, filing forms with the FTC and CFPB. How is this system fair? I was not in a position to prevent what the card companies did ( they could have prevented it ) but I am the one who gets screwed.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NV,895XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11231631

Despite my initial dispute filed on XXXX, the inaccuracies remain unresolved, causing continued harm and distress. 
The following violations have occurred in relation to this reporting : 1. Inaccurate Reporting of Late Payments : The XXXX XXXX accounts were incorrectly reported with late payments during a period when the accounts were in deferment status, as documented and verified by the US Department of Education ( documentation available upon request ). The accounts should reflect a current status with no late payments. Specifically, the following dates have been inaccurately reported as late payments : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Violation of Privacy and Unauthorized Reporting Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my personal financial information. Reporting these accounts with incorrect late payments without my consent constitutes a violation of my rights.

3. Failure to Maintain Accurate Reporting Under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and complete consumer files. By continuing to report these inaccuracies after my first dispute, the credit bureaus have failed in their obligations.

Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The errors include late payments being reported for months when the accounts were in deferment. Specifically, there are instances of 90- and 120-day late payments listed on my credit reports for XXXX and Experian XXXX despite the loans being in deferment as verified by the US Department of Education . These discrepancies have severely impacted my credit score and financial reputation.

Requested Action : Given the severity of these violations and the documented deferment status of my loans, I am formally requesting the immediate correction of these accounts from my consumer reports within 10 calendar days from the receipt of this complaint. The requested corrections include removing all late payments and ensuring the accounts reflect a current status with no delinquencies. Failure to resolve this matter will result in further escalation.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Dear XXXX  XXXX I am writing to formally dispute the reporting of the charge-off account associated with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on my credit report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Reinvestigation of Disputed Information ), and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information ), I am entitled to request and receive complete and accurate documentation to verify the accuracy and legality of this accounts reporting. Additionally, under [ Your State ] law, I am requesting proper validation of this debt. 
I would like to highlight several cases that affirm my right to dispute this information and request accurate reporting. In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), the court emphasized the duty of credit reporting agencies and furnishers to ensure the accuracy of the information reported on consumers ' credit reports. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) reinforces the requirement that furnishers conduct proper investigations into disputes and verify the accuracy of their reporting. 
To properly validate this account, I am requesting the following : 1. Authenticated Double-Entry Accounting Records I am requesting full double-entry accounting records for the account mentioned. This should include a detailed breakdown that shows how all transactions were debited and credited, ensuring compliance with standard accounting principles. Please note that I do not wish to receive a simple list of charges or statements. I expect authenticated evidence of the debt. 
The court ruling in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) held that mere conclusory statements from debt collectors or creditors do not satisfy the validation requirement. Only authenticated and verified documentation proving the validity of the debt is acceptable. 
XXXX. Authenticated Evidence Based on [ Your State ] Law In addition to the accounting records, I require authenticated evidence, in compliance with [ Your State ] law ( specific code if available ), that you have the legal right to report and collect this debt. This includes original signed contracts or agreements that show my obligation to pay the debt and your legal right to enforce collection and report it to credit bureaus. 
Without this evidence, the continued reporting of this debt XXXX constitute a violation of both federal and state consumer protection laws. 
In XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), the court held that creditors must produce original signed documentation to prove the validity of a debt. Failing to provide this evidence XXXX result in a violation of both state and federal consumer protection laws.

3. 1099-C Form If this debt has been forgiven, canceled, or settled for less than the full balance, I am requesting a copy of the 1099-C form filed with the IRS, which is required if the amount of canceled debt exceeds {$600.00}. If you have not provided this documentation, the debt may be considered dischargeXXXX, and it should no longer be reported as owed on my credit report.

The IRS has clearly outlined the requirements for filing a 1099-C form under 26 U.S.C. 6050P, which applies when a debt of {$600.00} or more is discharged or forgiven. If you have failed to file this form, the continued reporting of this debt may be fraudulent. 
In the absence of the requested documentation and verifiable evidence, I request that you immediately delete this account from my credit report in compliance with the FCRA and [ Your State ] law. Failure to do so will result in further action, including filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), pursuing legal remedies to enforce my rights, and submitting a Suspicious Activity Report ( SAR ) to the IRS for suspicion of fraud. The SAR ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) will be filed if you continue reporting inaccurate and unverified information without providing the required documentation. 
Please respond within 30 days of receipt of this letter. I look forward to receiving the required documentation or confirmation that the account has",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,KY,40508,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11238794

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Late Payments on Credit Report Dear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding inaccurate late payments that are reported on my credit file maintained by Experian. I believe these late payments are erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 
Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments listed on my credit report for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are inaccurate. My payment history reflects consistent on-time payments, and I have been enrolled in autopay for this account. 
Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness. 
Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information. 
Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The account reflects late payments in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which are inaccurate. 
Payment history should reflect 100 % on-time payments. 
The discrepancies misrepresent my creditworthiness and violate consumer protection laws. 
Requested Resolution : I request that Experian conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payments from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments. 
I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of these entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

2024-12-21,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","I currently have a mortgage loan and the bank that has managed it since XXXX is Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. Their address is : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ; telephones numbers : XXXX. XXXX. 

The investor who purchased the account in XXXX is XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, mailing address : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 

The point of controversy is that Shellpoint is billing me since last XX/XX/XXXX, {$2300.00} for property taxes that have allegedly not been paid. I proceeded immediately and request a certification of XXXX ( XXXX ) debt from XXXX and send it to Shellpoint by certified mail and requested that the charges be dismissed. I made multiple calls about it without having a concrete answer by XX/XX/XXXX I wrote again explaining the situation, and called them again finally they transferred me to the property tax division of the bank and speaking with them I discovered that the property number they ( Shellpoint ) have is not the same as property was assigned by XXXX XXXX  XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX by its acronym in XXXX ( XXXX ) they had a different one. 

After realizing that, I immediately went to the XXXX offices to re-confirm that the number that my certification had was in fact the correct one of the property and thus had been certified by them. once I clarified that the bank had the wrong number, I wrote to them and once again I sent them an updated certification stating that the information I have is correct one that they need to confirm within XXXX office and make the proper correction. In response to my letter, they wrote to me requesting additional time to be able to work on the case and investigate. In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted them again, they couldn't give me a concrete answer about what they had done in XXXX they wrote and asked me again for a certification of no debt because they couldn't request it directly to the XXXX office, once again I proceeded to send them the certification required by certified mail then I called in XXXX nothing yet, called again in XX/XX/XXXX they have confirmed that they have all the documentation requested, however they can not explain why they have not processed it yet. 

The customer service representative said it will takes a little more than a week to process it, which I gave reasonable time for them to process so I just call again Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX the customer service representative was surprised because the information had not yet been submitted, the certification was in the system, he mentioned that there was no reason why that information had not been processed. 

I was told once again that we must wait but on this occasion the customer service representative informed me and explains that he can not eliminate the charges until they ( Shellpoint ) make a refund request to XXXX and once XXXX will reimburse the money, they will drop the charges, If they do not refund the money the charge for {$2300.00} will remain. I understand that if the error was caused either by the financial institution or the XXXX, that is an issue between them to resolve, I do not have to be penalized for it or been in the middle of it. 

Since they have dragged their feet on the matter for more than a year without being able to resolve it, I sent them a letter last Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, which I included along with the other documents as exhibits in which I inform Shellpoint that I will open an account in the state court of XXXX XXXX and from now on I will deposit the mortgage payments in that account until they finally eliminate the property tax charges that are not applicable and that Proof of this are the certifications that have been sent updated on multiple occasions. Because of this situation I had to stop sending principal payments so I could have paid off the mortgage by last XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",PR,00705,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11243251

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681 and Section 605B, I demand that these accounts be removed immediately from my credit report. 

The following accounts are at issue : XXXX XXXX XXXX IN ( Original Creditor : XXXX ) {$920.00} ( Updated XX/XX/year> ) LVNV FUNDING LLC ( Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) {$1600.00} ( Updated XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ) {$410.00} ( Updated XX/XX/year> ) These debts have been improperly reported, and my personally identifiable information ( PII ) was compromised in a data breach.

The failure to address this promptly is a direct violation of federal laws designed to protect consumers like myself. 

In addition to requesting the removal of these accounts, I have sent disputes directly to the reporting agencies and demanded that IRS Form XXXX be provided for verification of any canceled, forgiven, or written-off debt. However, these agencies have continued their collection efforts and reporting practices without proper documentation. 

I request that the CFPB investigate these agencies for their violations of the FDCPA, FCRA, and the negligent handling of consumer data. I urge you to ensure that these debts are removed from my credit report without delay. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XX/XX/year> Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Missing and Inaccurate Account Information Dear CFPB, I am filing a formal complaint against Experian for failing to provide complete and accurate information regarding my credit report for account XXXX. Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year> ), my requests have been ignored, violating both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the inaccuracies persist. 
FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The absence of detailed reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement.

Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files, which has not been upheld in my case.

Reporting incomplete information violates 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, which prohibits the omission of essential data regarding accounts.

Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : Missing account details such as balances, high credit limit, and payment history. 
No reported late payments ; however, the omission of critical account information creates inconsistencies in my credit profile. 
Impact on Creditworthiness : The lack of comprehensive and accurate information in my XXXX report has created discrepancies across credit bureaus, undermining my creditworthiness and leading to financial harm. 
Desired Resolution : Immediate inclusion of all relevant account details in my credit report.

Written confirmation of the updates.

Assurance that the reporting will be accurate and consistent moving forward. 
If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with relevant agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Reference Accounts : XXXX I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report, pursuant to Section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, and request the immediate removal of any fraudulent accounts associated with my name and personal information. In accordance with this law, I have provided the necessary FTC Identity Theft Report to support my claim of fraudulent activity and data breach. I recently discovered that my personal information was compromised as part of a data breach involving XXXX. As a direct result of this breach, I am now facing fraudulent collections accounts on my credit report. The unauthorized use of my personal information has led to these collections being wrongly attributed to me. Under the FCRA, specifically Section 605B, I am entitled to request the removal of these fraudulent accounts from my credit file, as they do not reflect any legitimate debt I owe. 2. Request for Immediate Removal of Fraudulent Information : Under Section 605B of the FCRA, I request that you immediately remove all accounts that were opened fraudulently or are associated with identity theft from my credit report. These accounts were not authorized by me and have been opened as a result of the data breach involving XXXX. I have included a copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report, which details the fraudulent activity and confirms the theft of my personal information. 3. Legal Timeframe for Removal : Under Section 605B of the FCRA, when a consumer submits a valid FTC Identity Theft Report, credit reporting agencies must take action to investigate and remove fraudulent accounts within 4 business days. Therefore, I request that you immediately remove these fraudulent accounts from my credit report and correct the inaccuracies. Failure to comply with this requirement will leave me no choice but to pursue further legal actions, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 4. Failure to Verify Fraudulent Accounts : As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), when a consumer disputes information on their credit report, the credit bureaus must conduct a reasonable investigation into the disputed items. However, I have reason to believe that the fraudulent accounts, stemming from the data breach, have not been properly investigated or removed. Despite my prior dispute, these accounts remain on my credit report, which is causing severe damage to my credit score. 5. Request for Removal Due to Inaccuracy or Fraud : As these accounts are the result of identity theft and a data breach, I am requesting that you immediately remove them from my credit file in accordance with the FCRA. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), if information can not be verified or is found to be inaccurate or incomplete, it must be deleted. This includes accounts opened fraudulently due to a data breach. 6. FTC Report Submission : Enclosed with this letter is a copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report, which I filed to support my claim. According to the FCRA and guidelines of the Federal Trade Commission, this report serves as evidence that I have been a victim of identity theft and data breach, and it should be sufficient for the removal of fraudulent accounts from my credit report. I kindly ask that you complete your investigation and remove the fraudulent accounts from my credit report within 4 business days, as required by law. If you do not comply with the FCRA, I will escalate the matter by filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and may consider pursuing further legal action. Please provide written confirmation that these fraudulent accounts have been removed and that my credit report has been updated to reflect the accurate information. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

On XX/XX/2024, I transferred my {$130.00} cash back rewards to my credit card to apply toward my XXXX bill. This transfer was categorized as Payments and Other Credits,. On XX/XX/2024, I made a payment of {$210.00}, which was a few days late ; my due date was XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America has confirmed they do not impose penalties until a payment is 30 days late, a threshold I did not reach. 
After multiple conversations with Bank of America representatives via phone, it was confirmed that the late payment in XXXX should not have triggered a flag. However, I was informed that cash back rewards do not count as an official payment, despite the system allowing the transfer. I was advised that I could have moved the funds from my cash back rewards to my checking account and then made a payment to avoid the flag, which seems unnecessary given that I used the rewards directly. 
On XX/XX/2024 I visited the Bank of America branch on XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX and her manager, who confirmed that cash back rewards can indeed be applied to credit card balances. They assured me that this is a common practice. We filed another complaint to resolve the issue, and a representative promised to fax a statement confirming the resolution. However, after two days and multiple calls, I have yet to receive that fax.

The first claim was automatically initiated by the bank after issuing a fraud alert.

I requested that they send me that proof because neither I nor any of my authorized users made these purchases, but they denied my request. 

I decided to go to a physical office of the Bank of America and talk to a banker about the case, she told me that I had to send a form, and I explained that I never received anything, so she called, and the case was reopened. But I never received the form that was mentioned to me and again the case was not approved. So, I had to pay for those purchases although neither I nor my authorized users did, in order not to damage my credit history.

I recently spoke with a representative at the CFPB to clarify several issues with this account. These issues remain unresolved and have caused significant harm to my credit and financial stability. 

In XXXX, I paid {$320.00} on a {$300.00} balance for my credit card. Despite this payment, Capital One initially claimed there were returned transactions. However, after insisting they look deeper into the account, the company confirmed that the balance had been paid in full. 

After paying off the balance, I contacted Capital One to remind them that I am an XXXX XXXX XXXX. The company stated they would review my account to determine if I was entitled to any reimbursement for interest or late payment fees under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). Instead of resolving the matter fairly, I was charged {$7.00} in interest fees beginning in XXXX. These fees have since compounded, resulting in a current balance of {$68.00}. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, Capital One is charging off the account. This situation reflects unfair credit reporting practices, especially toward an XXXX XXXX servicemember striving to maintain financial stability and build credit responsibly. 

I respectfully request the CFPB to intervene and thoroughly review this case to ensure Capital Ones practices are in compliance with applicable laws, including the XXXX. Additionally, I would appreciate guidance on resolving this matter fairly and preventing further harm to my credit report.

This reporting violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and has caused significant harm to my XXXX XXXX and financial reputation. 

Key Issues : Incorrect Reporting of Sold Debt : Capital XXXX is reporting a balance of {$470.00} on my Experian credit report, even though this debt was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Under the FCRA, once an account is sold, the original creditor is required to update the balance to {$0.00} and note that the debt was transferred or sold. XXXX XXXX has failed to update this information properly. 
Impact on My Credit Report and Score : The continued reporting of this balance by Capital XXXX creates confusion and misrepresents my financial obligations, resulting in a negative impact on my XXXX XXXX. 
This inaccurate reporting has adversely affected my ability to secure financial opportunities. 
Failure to Address the Issue : Despite previous disputes and attempts to resolve this matter directly with XXXX XXXX, they have not corrected their reporting. 
XXXX Requested : I request the following actions : Immediate Update of the Account : XXXX XXXX must update the account on my Experian credit report to reflect a {$0.00} balance and clearly indicate that the debt was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Removal of Inaccurate Reporting : If XXXX XXXX can not validate the current reporting, I request that the account be removed entirely from my Experian credit report. 
Compliance with the FCRA : XXXX XXXX must ensure their reporting practices comply with the FCRA to avoid future inaccuracies. 
Supporting Documents Enclosed : A copy of my Experian credit report showing the incorrect reporting by XXXX XXXX. 
Correspondence with XXXX XXXX regarding this dispute. 
Impact and Final Request : The continued inaccurate reporting by XXXX XXXX on my Experian credit report has caused significant financial harm and undue stress. I kindly request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring XXXX XXXX updates this account appropriately and in compliance with federal regulations. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Their error in my credit reporting for the past two months has cost my XXXX XXXX to take a major hit. XXXX need to call the credit bureaus in addition to submitting a new letter to include XXXX reporting as well. 

I recently had some major repairs completed on my XXXX XXXX which had financially crippled me at the moment. I have my car loan via XXXX. I logged onto my account on XX/XX/XXXX and there was availability to pay one car payment and then fill out online documents for an extension on the remaining balance. I made the payment of {$220.00} and the extension documents were completed showing I was now current and would not be reported 30 days delinquent on my credit report. XXXX sent me a copy of the extension documents signed on by both parties for approval. Document number XXXX. Days later I go back in to look at my account and no evidence of the Deferment and now Ive been reported 30 days late. I called XXXX today, XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, a Customer relations associate.

I told her nothing was sent to me in writing stating this. She told me that they do not send the denial out in writing. I requested the denial in writing. She told me she was not going to send it to me. I told her then I can not believe it was actually denied. I have a signed document of approval and without a denial in writing, they could be telling me anything. I want my credit reporting corrected for this month as its unfair I was approved and under the impression I would not be reported as delinquent. I want my deferment shown as up to date and my credit reporting corrected and fixed. Also spoke to XXXX, ID number XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX, also denied me the right to have the denial in writing.

Specifically, I have identified several collection accounts listed that fail to provide adequate information regarding the original creditor, which I believe constitutes erroneous reporting. 

Upon reviewing my credit report, I found that these collection accounts lack sufficient details regarding the original creditor, including the name and contact information of the creditor, the date the debt was incurred, and other necessary data that would support the validity of these collections. Without this critical information, I am unable to verify the legitimacy of the debts, and they should not remain on my credit report. 

As required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am requesting that these collection accounts be removed from my credit file.

I contacted the Police in XXXX, XXXX  and was told there was not too much they could do but would investigate even though they were dramatically short staffed and it was the start of XXXX. The XXXX police did nothing and refused to return my calls. I could not travel to XXXX as XXXX restrictions had begun and I could not leave Connecticut. 

I made XXXX additional attempts through CapitalOne to reverse the transactions and they kept stating that since the transfers were done from a trusted computer there was nothing they would do.

I told them there was no such place to do that on their site. Additionally, in the Terms of Service with CapitalOne, there was nothing mentioned that I had to call or contact the bank to untrust the computer. 

I was unsure who it was that initiated the transfers so I contacted the CEO of the Management Company, Prestige Hospitality. It turned out to be the Night Auditor of the hotel.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them on my lunch break ( around XXXX XXXX ), which is within their open hours, and it stated to call back during the hours they are available. I called them again that evening ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and when I was able to speak with someone, the resolution team was unavailable. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called back and spoke with them. They asked for my information like income and expenses and was told I had to get in touch with my cosigner for them to ask the same questions. When we tried calling him, he did not answer. During that time, I requested an income based repayment plan. They told me that they don't have income based payment plans. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to call my cosigner to go through the same process. He did not answer ; I tried calling several times. I then reached out to Sallie Mae to request a repayment plan without speaking with the cosigner. The representative asked me the same questions as before. He asked how I was paying my bills with the income that I have, and I stated that I wasn't able to keep up with everything. He even stated that he saw 2 payments of the amount that is due on a monthly basis, and implied that I was lying to him about my expenses. I asked about options like an income based repayment plan, and he then again repeated that they would have to consider the information from my cosigner before making any decisions.

I am writing to seek your assistance regarding a troubling situation I have encountered with Bank of America concerning the handling of my recent dispute. 

On XX/XX/year>, I opened a dispute related to a transaction with XXXX XXXX for a XXXX XXXX experience that did not go as promised. Below are the details of the claim : - **Claim ID : ** XXXX - **Claim Amount : ** {$5900.00} - **Claim Opened : ** XX/XX/year> Approximately one month ago, I provided Bank of America with sufficient documentation to support my request for a refund. The difficulties arose when I booked my stay on the cruise ship, only to later find out that my original accommodation was no longer available. This led me to accept a downgraded room, under the assurance from the merchant that I would receive a refund for the initial booking. However, in order to secure the downgraded room, I was required to make an immediate payment for a different room, which I covered using my XXXX XXXX card ending in XXXX. 

Despite my best efforts to obtain a refund from XXXX XXXX, my numerous inquiries have gone unanswered. Following the initiation of my dispute with Bank of America, I finally received acknowledgment from the merchant stating that they were reviewing my issue. I submitted all relevant communications and evidence to Bank of America ; however, my dispute was closed in favor of XXXX XXXX  without any thorough investigation or consideration of the materials I provided. 

I am deeply troubled by Bank of Americas handling of my claim, which seems both unprofessional and negligent. The closure of my dispute without a comprehensive review of the evidence is concerning and has left me without the funds that are rightfully owed to me. 

I am now seeking legal advice and assistance from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in addressing this situation. I believe it is imperative for financial institutions to uphold their obligations to their customers and ensure fair dispute resolution processes. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate any guidance or support you can offer as I navigate this troubling situation.

In early 2024, XX/XX/XXXX to be precise I signed up for XXXX XXXX XXXX credit repair service, which was to be paid in six installments of {$300.00}, totaling {$1800.00}. I have already paid {$1500.00} over five installments. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen financial circumstances, I missed the last payment of {$300.00}. Instead of working with me to resolve this issue, XXXX XXXX XXXX  took the following actions : 1. Lack of Service Delivery : Despite paying {$1500.00}, the services I was promised about a year ago have not been rendered. No meaningful progress has been communicated, nor have any results been delivered. 

2. Blocked Access to Customer Portal : XXXX XXXX  XXXX  removed my access to their online customer portal, preventing me from reviewing any updates or progress on my account. 

3. Unresponsiveness : The company has failed to answer my phone calls or any attempts Ive made to contact them, including writing the business owner personally on his instagram account for clarification or assistance which he promised but did not. 

4. Termination of Services : Without notice or explanation, when my cousin contacted the business owner on his XXXX  account, he confirmed that they terminated my service entirely, citing the missed {$300.00} payment as the reason, even though I had already paid 83 % of the total cost. 

I believe these actions are unethical and unacceptable. Not only have they failed to honor their contractual obligations, they have wasted my time and have also demonstrated a lack of professionalism and accountability.

This reporting violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and has caused significant harm to my credit score and financial reputation.

Key Issues : Incorrect Reporting of Sold Debt : Capital One is reporting a balance of {$470.00} on my XXXX credit report, even though this debt was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Under the FCRA, once an account is sold, the original creditor is required to update the balance to {$0.00} and note that the debt was transferred or sold. Capital One has failed to update this information properly. 
Impact on My Credit Report and Score : The continued reporting of this balance by Capital One creates confusion and misrepresents my financial obligations, resulting in a negative impact on my credit score.

This inaccurate reporting has adversely affected my ability to secure financial opportunities.

Failure to Address the Issue : Despite previous disputes and attempts to resolve this matter directly with Capital One, they have not corrected their reporting.

Resolution Requested : I request the following actions : Immediate Update of the Account : Capital One must update the account on my XXXX credit report to reflect a {$0.00} balance and clearly indicate that the debt was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Removal of Inaccurate Reporting : If Capital One can not validate the current reporting, I request that the account be removed entirely from my XXXX credit report. 
Compliance with the FCRA : Capital One must ensure their reporting practices comply with the FCRA to avoid future inaccuracies. 
Supporting Documents Enclosed : A copy of my XXXX credit report showing the incorrect reporting by Capital One. 
Correspondence with Capital One regarding this dispute. 
Impact and Final Request : The continued inaccurate reporting by Capital One on my XXXX credit report has caused significant financial harm and undue stress. I kindly request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring Capital One updates this account appropriately and in compliance with federal regulations.

Normally 1 day off the due day, so I scheduled a payment to come out of my account that pay the payment monthly so I could be free of the fee but nope I got charged. I think is massively unfair to be considered late or even 24 hrs after the due date. 

There should be a grace period were peerson like me can setup those payments to enusre payment goes through. 

I would greatly appreciate removal of the most recent late fee charged on both cards with Captial one because i am not rich and I don't have the money to pay off the cards once or I would them I would never be charged this massively poor fee... 


Also, if I setup a payment that is the day after not even 24 hrs after the due date the fee should not be charged because it was paid within 24 hrs of the due dates.

Its massively messed up that every month I'd I am late my 4 hours or 12 hours I get charged a large fee.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Formal Dispute Regarding Reporting of Late Payments and Permissible Purpose Dear [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ], I am writing to formally dispute certain entries on my credit report that indicate late payments. Specifically, I question whether the entity reporting these late payments had a permissible purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as codified in 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ), to access and report this information.

Under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ), a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only under specific circumstances that constitute a permissible purpose. These purposes include, but are not limited to, transactions initiated by the consumer, employment considerations, or other legitimate needs as defined by law. If the entity reporting these late payments accessed or shared my information outside these parameters, they may have violated federal law.

The late payments in question are associated with the following account ( s ) : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date ( s ) of Late Payment ( s ) : XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX I request that you investigate this matter promptly. Please verify whether the reporting entity had a permissible purpose to access and furnish this information and provide me with documentation supporting their compliance with the FCRA. If the reporting can not be verified or is found to lack a permissible purpose, I demand that these entries be deleted from my credit report immediately.

Furthermore, I request that you notify me of the results of your investigation, as well as any changes made to my credit report, within the time frame prescribed by law.

For your reference, I have attached a copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed entries, along with copies of relevant supporting documentation, including proof of identity.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

The inquiry in question was made on XX/XX/year>. This inquiry was conducted without my consent and therefore violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically regarding permissible purpose. 

Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ), a company must have a permissible purpose to access a consumers credit report. Since I did not authorize or initiate any business dealings that would grant your company such access, these inquiries are unauthorized.

I request that you immediately : 1.Remove the unauthorized inquiries from all of my credit reports ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
2.Provide compensation of {$1000.00} as stipulated under the FCRA for each violation. 

If you are willing to resolve this matter amicably, I am prepared to sign an agreement that includes the removal of these inquiries and the payment of the compensation without requiring your client to admit any wrongdoing. This would be a mutually beneficial resolution and would save both parties the time and expense of further action.Failure to do so mat also lead meto file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other regulatory agencies. 

Please be advised that if I am forced to litigate, I will seek actual damages as allowed under the FCRA, including but not limited to costs incurred as a result of these unauthorized inquiries. Additionally, I will pursue compensation for attorneys fees, court costs, and other expenses related to litigation. Below is an itemized estimate of potential litigation costs : Attorney Fees : {$5000.00} - {$10000.00} Court Filing Fees : {$500.00} Discovery Costs : {$1000.00} Expert Witness Fees ( if necessary ) : {$3000.00} Additional Miscellaneous Costs : {$1000.00} Total Estimated Litigation Costs : {$10000.00} - {$15000.00} I urge you to consider the significant expense litigation would entail for your company in comparison to resolving this matter promptly and amicably. 

Please provide a written response to this letter within 15 days of receipt, confirming the steps you will take to address this matter. If I do not receive a satisfactory resolution, I will be compelled to explore additional remedies available to me under the law.

I have noticed that my account ( XXXX XXXXXXXX ) related to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was reported in XX/XX/year>. But was deleted by TransUnion Between XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/year> from my credit report. This action has adversely affected my credit history and overall credit score, undermining my financial standing.

The Congressional findings highlight the importance of accurate and fair credit reporting, emphasizing how inaccuracies can impair the efficiency of the banking system and erode public confidence. As a consumer, I rely on accurate credit reporting for fair access to credit, and the deletion of my account has hindered that access. 

I am uploading a copy of my XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit report for your review. I kindly request that you investigate this matter and facilitate the reinstatement of my account on my credit report.

I believe these late payments are erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 
Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments listed on my credit report for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are inaccurate. My payment history reflects consistent on-time payments, and I have been enrolled in autopay for this account. 
Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information. 
Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The account reflects late payments in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which are inaccurate. 
Payment history should reflect 100 % on-time payments. 
The discrepancies misrepresent my creditworthiness and violate consumer protection laws. 
Requested Resolution : I request that TransUnion conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payments from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments. 
I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of these entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer.

Specifically, I question whether the entity reporting these late payments had a permissible purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as codified in 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ), to access and report this information.

Under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ), a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only under specific circumstances that constitute a permissible purpose. These purposes include, but are not limited to, transactions initiated by the consumer, employment considerations, or other legitimate needs as defined by law. If the entity reporting these late payments accessed or shared my information outside these parameters, they may have violated federal law.

The late payments in question are associated with the following account ( s ) : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date ( s ) of Late Payment ( s ) : XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX I request that you investigate this matter promptly. Please verify whether the reporting entity had a permissible purpose to access and furnish this information and provide me with documentation supporting their compliance with the FCRA. If the reporting can not be verified or is found to lack a permissible purpose, I demand that these entries be deleted from my credit report immediately.

Furthermore, I request that you notify me of the results of your investigation, as well as any changes made to my credit report, within the time frame prescribed by law.

For your reference, I have attached a copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed entries, along with copies of relevant supporting documentation, including proof of identity.

b.All state-level appeals and collateral attacks on any judgment must be complete within two years from the date of appeal in non-capital cases and within five years from the date of appeal in capital cases, unless a court enters an order with specific findings as to why the court was unable to comply with this subparagraph and the circumstances causing the delay.

The court or other authority with jurisdiction shall act promptly on such a request, affording a remedy by due course of law for the violation of any right. The reasons for any decision regarding the disposition of a victims right shall be clearly stated on the record.

( d ) The granting of the rights enumerated in this section to victims may not be construed to deny or impair any other rights possessed by victims. The provisions of this section apply throughout criminal and juvenile justice processes, are self-executing, and do not require implementing legislation. This section may not be construed to create any cause of action for damages against the state or a political subdivision of the state, or any officer, employee, or agent of the state or its political subdivisions.

Here is a summary of the situation : Account Status : XXXX has reported an account of mine as "" charged off '' on my credit report for several years. However, despite this reporting, XXXX has failed to issue a 1099-C form, which is required when a debt is forgiven. 
Attempts to Resolve : I have reached out to XXXX multiple times to inquire about this issue. 
Specifically, I have contacted XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, seeking clarification and requesting the necessary 1099-C form. 
Despite my repeated attempts, I have yet to receive a response or the requested form. The company has not provided any documentation or explanation for the charged-off status. 
Impact on My Credit : The failure to provide the 1099-C form or to resolve this matter has caused confusion regarding my credit report and has left me in a state of uncertainty about the true status of my account with XXXX. 
I have made every effort to address this matter directly with XXXX, but without success. I am now seeking the assistance of the CFPB in ensuring that XXXX provides the required 1099-C form and corrects any potential inaccuracies in the reporting of this account. 

Please let me know if any additional information is needed to assist with this matter.

I have previously notified you of the inaccuracies, yet no corrective action has been taken. This ongoing violation of federal law demonstrates negligence and disregard for your legal responsibilities.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, you are legally obligated to ensure that all information you report is accurate, complete, and verifiable. Specifically : 1 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Credit reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy in the information they report.

2 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) : Upon notice of a dispute, you are required to conduct a prompt and thorough reinvestigation to verify or remove the contested information.

3 15 U.S.C. 1681n : Noncompliance with the FCRA subjects you to civil liability, including actual damages, statutory damages of {$1000.00} per violation, punitive damages, and attorney fees.

In addition to your violations of the FCRA, multiple court rulings have affirmed the illegality of reporting inaccurate or unverified child support accounts to credit bureaus XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : The court ruled that the federal government wrongfully reported child support arrears to credit bureaus and ordered the records expungedXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   ) : The court found that the child support agency violated the paying parents due process rights by reporting arrears without proper notice.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The court reversed a decision to report child support arrears due to a lack of evidence and improper procedures.

I have solid evidence that the child support account information you are reporting is false and was provided without proper verification or notice.

I have never provided my consent for this account to be reported, which is an additional violation of my rights.

As a result of your continued failure to comply with federal law, I have suffered significant harm, including financial damages and emotional distress. Therefore, I am demanding : 1 Immediate removal of the inaccurate child support account from my credit report.

2 Payment of {$1000.00} in statutory damages per bureau for failing to comply with the FCRA, payable to me at the address listed above.

If you fail to comply with this demand, I will have no choice but to initiate litigation against all three credit bureaus for willful violations of the FCRA and associated damages. In court, I will seek the maximum allowable damages, including statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees. 

This is your final notice. I strongly urge you to take this matter seriously and fulfill your legal obligations. You may contact me via email only.

These late payments, specifically a 30-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX and a 60-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX, are erroneous and do not reflect my actual payment history. 
Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The listed late payments are incorrect as I have consistently made my payments on time through autopay. 
Violation of FCRA ( 15 USC 1681i and 1681s-2 ) : Credit reporting agencies and furnishers are required to ensure maximum accuracy in consumer files. The failure to correct these inaccuracies constitutes noncompliance with federal law.

Summary of Discrepancies TransUnion : Reported 30-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX and 60-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX. 
These are incorrect as the account history reflects consistent payments with no delinquencies.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Late Payments on Credit Report Dear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding inaccurate late payments that are reported on my credit file maintained by TransUnion. I believe these late payments are erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 
Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments listed on my credit report for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are inaccurate. My payment history reflects consistent on-time payments, and I have been enrolled in autopay for this account. 
Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information. 
Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The account reflects late payments in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which are inaccurate. 
Payment history should reflect 100 % on-time payments. 
The discrepancies misrepresent my creditworthiness and violate consumer protection laws. 
Requested Resolution : I request that TransUnion conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payments from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments. 
I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of these entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"am writing to formally notify you that your attempts to collect on the alleged debt referenced above are in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 USC 1692-1692p. 
If you are not aware this entire claim is regulated by an arbitration agreement with *insert original creditor*, which clearly stipulates that "" any dispute must be resolved through arbitration due to the binding agreement. '' To date there has been no arbitration proceedings. As a direct result of that this is considered a material breach of the arbitration terms listed in the original agreement acknowledged by all involved parties. I confidently assert that you have no right to collect on this alleged debt. 
I am writing this as I humbly seek to have this discrepancy resolved both promptly and amicably. 
With that, my demands are as follows : 1. You must promptly notify any credit reporting agency to remove all information and/or tradelines associated with this account. I request a written confirmation of that communication to be sent to the address you have on file ; 2. A settlement agreement that I may retain for my records. 
3. Monetary compensation in the amount of {$1000.00}. 
While I do not desire or anticipate that your negligence may force me to purse further legal action, that option will be explored. In the event that needs to happen, you are subject to a significant increase in demands to cover damages, attorney fees, and more. I am sure a company of your caliber does not look to unreasonably be exposed to those routes. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. We look forward to resolving this issue promptly.

In compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and as a gesture of respect to the Federal Trade Commission Committee on accuracy and completeness of credit information I am formally writing in today to dispute negative information appearing on my credit. This incorrect information is greatly hindering me from getting the credit score I deserve and hopefully, this letter will resolve all the issues on my credit.

I demand to see Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) of the accounts listed below. Your failure to positively verify these accounts and inquiries has hurt my ability to obtain credit. 

Items that need attention : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : {$25000.00} Charged off Inquiries in Dispute : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",MI,499XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11243309
2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"RE : Formal Demand to Remove Inaccurate XXXX XXXX Account from Credit Report To Whom It May Concern, This letter serves as my third and final demand that you immediately remove the inaccurate XXXX XXXX account information from my credit report. I have previously notified you of the inaccuracies, yet no corrective action has been taken. This ongoing violation of federal law demonstrates negligence and disregard for your legal responsibilities. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, you are legally obligated to ensure that all information you report is accurate, complete, and verifiable. Specifically : 1 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Credit reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy in the information they report. 
2 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) : Upon notice of a dispute, you are required to conduct a prompt and thorough reinvestigation to verify or remove the contested information.

3 15 U.S.C. 1681n : Noncompliance with the FCRA subjects you to civil liability, including actual damages, statutory damages of {$1000.00} per violation, punitive damages, and attorney fees. 
In addition to your violations of the FCRA, multiple court rulings have affirmed the illegality of reporting inaccurate or unverified XXXX XXXX accounts to credit bureaus : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX United States ( XXXX ) : The court ruled that the federal government wrongfully reported XXXX XXXX arrears to credit bureaus and ordered the records expunged. 
XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : The court found that the XXXX XXXX agency violated the paying parents due process rights by reporting arrears without proper notice. 
XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX ) : The court reversed a decision to report XXXX XXXX  arrears due to a lack of evidence and improper procedures. 

I have solid evidence that the XXXX XXXX account information you are reporting is false and was provided without proper verification or notice. I have never provided my consent for this account to be reported, which is an additional violation of my rights. 

As a result of your continued failure to comply with federal law, I have suffered significant harm, including financial damages and emotional distress. Therefore, I am demanding : 1 Immediate removal of the inaccurate XXXX XXXX account from my credit report. 
2 Payment of {$1000.00} in statutory damages per bureau for failing to comply with the FCRA, payable to me at the address listed above. 

If you fail to comply with this demand, I will have no choice but to initiate litigation against all three credit bureaus for willful violations of the FCRA and associated damages. In court, I will seek the maximum allowable damages, including statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees. 

This is your final notice. I strongly urge you to take this matter seriously and fulfill your legal obligations. Contact me via email only.

I filed multiple disputes with TransUnion, including the following dispute reports : Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Despite these efforts, TransUnion has failed to correct the errors or provide verification of the account 's accuracy. Their responses have been generic and inadequate, failing to address the specific inaccuracies I identified. 

TransUnion has also violated 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), which requires them to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information. They continue to report the same incomplete and inconsistent data, which has caused harm to my creditworthiness, including credit denials, higher financial costs, and emotional distress. 

I request that the CFPB take immediate action to ensure TransUnion complies with the FCRA by : Permanently deleting the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account from my credit report due to its unverifiable and inaccurate nature.

These late payments, specifically a 30-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX and a 60-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX, are erroneous and do not reflect my actual payment history. 
Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The listed late payments are incorrect as I have consistently made my payments on time through autopay. 
Violation of FCRA ( 15 USC 1681i and 1681s-2 ) : Credit reporting agencies and furnishers are required to ensure maximum accuracy in consumer files. The failure to correct these inaccuracies constitutes noncompliance with federal law. 
Violation of FDCPA ( 15 USC 1692e ) : Reporting incorrect information about payments may qualify as deceptive or misleading practices under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

Violation of TILA ( 15 USC 1601 ) : The Truth in Lending Act mandates accurate reporting of credit terms and histories. 
Civil Liability Under FCRA ( 15 USC 1681n and 1681o ) : Noncompliance with these provisions subjects the responsible parties to legal liabilities, including actual damages, punitive damages, and legal fees. 
Summary of Discrepancies TransUnion : Reported 30-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX and 60-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX. 
These are incorrect as the account history reflects consistent payments with no delinquencies. 
Requested Resolution : I request the following : Conduct a thorough investigation into the discrepancies on this account. 
Remove the inaccurate late payment entries from my credit file. 
Provide written confirmation of the corrections within 30 days, as required under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

TransUnion has failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which requires credit reporting agencies to ensure maximum possible accuracy. 

The account contains incomplete and inconsistent information, including missing balance details, payment terms, and contradictory payment history. For example, the account shows late payments ( XX/XX/XXXX : 60 days past due ; XX/XX/XXXX : 30 days past due ) despite being listed as "" Paid, Closed. '' These inaccuracies render the account unverifiable and misleading. 

I filed multiple disputes with TransUnion, including the following dispute reports : Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Report Number : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Despite these efforts, TransUnion has failed to correct the errors or provide verification of the account 's accuracy.

TransUnion has also violated 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), which requires them to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information. They continue to report the same incomplete and inconsistent data, which has caused harm to my creditworthiness, including credit denials, higher financial costs, and emotional distress.

2024-12-21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","According to the last communication I received from XXXX after applying for the SAVE consolidation and new payment plans, communication I did receive noted that I have taken out about {XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  subsequently, have repaid {XXXX XXXX and still owe XXXX XXXX on student loands. I am aware that the SAVE plan was disabled by the courts, and that Republicans plan to repeal PSLF by recess. This is a complex issue that in my view involves predatory student loans, predatory higher education, and predatory landlords and employers. 

The inception of my student loan debt began in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Although I had excellent grades and scored in the top 1XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because when I chose to go to college after high school, scholarship funds for non traditional students pale in comparison to graduating high school seniors. Student loan debt we were counseled was good debt. When because I was technologically savvy loved ones and career advisors counseled me to go into XXXX, and I found out XXXX had a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I enrolled. 

Although I don't have any of the printed brochures to document the same any longer, I was told ( and my mother would attest as I appealed to get independent student status at XXXX when I completed a FAFSA, and she attended two meetings with me with an program advisor and financial aid administrator ) that the program had a 90 % success rate with 90 % of graduates finding employment with XXXX XXXX corporations. Of course they didn't allow me into XXXX XXXX classes and required me to get a course of general education credits before I was able to get into my first XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, from which the initial XXXX XXXX of my student loan debt was incurred. 

In truth, 70 % of the students in my cohort dropped out of the program and were unsuccessful because its instructors were from XXXX, hardly spoke XXXX, and their accents were so thick that we could barely understand them. When we asked for clarification or for them to repeat information, they screamed at us. Thus, 70 % of us dropped, self included. They had misrepresented the program to us, and predatorily preyed upon us to get our student loan, grant, and private loan dollars ( I took no private loans ). 

I decided to pursue then XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as I was getting wiser about the cost of higher education, but despite my asking and inquiring and being assured that all of my credits would transfer from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I wasted roughly a year of my life as after I transferred to XXXX, about half of those credits did not transfer and I had to retake the classes, requiring more debt as a non traditional student. However, to their credit, and because of state income tax in Nebraska, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  did have more scholarship money for exceptional non-traditional students such as myself which I was encouraged to apply for by my professors, which I did, and I was awarded a full-ride ( no living stipend ) to XXXX. During this time, my then partner and then wife and I conceived inconveniently, and with an infant at home after XXXX, could not afford to make our ends meet at the wages we were making and moved in with her parents. It was not a savory environment in which to raise a child XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  And so while I could not turn down a full ride that had been awarded wisely, and we looked at ways to try to make our ends meet ( we were too proud to apply for public assistance ), my then wife and I decided our best move was to move to my hometown of XXXXXXXX XXXX where I had familial support for raising our infant. 

I spoke to the XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, and they assured me that while I could complete all but the last year of my education in XXXX accurately, they deceived us in response to my questions about whether there would be adequate course selection and availability for me to get a full time schedule together. Of course before moving home to XXXXXXXX XXXX to continue my education through XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX, I applied for and was admitted to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Upon being admitted, I spoke to the XXXX XXXX XXXX  and my initial conversation by phone with the admissions counselor with whom I conversed to gain admission, and faxed them a copy of my full ride scholarship award letter ( which I still do have, even if I do not have documentation of my having faxed it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) from the XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX, asking if they would match the scholarship. The admissions counselor promised me that they would match my full-ride scholarship if I earned straight As ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

After I did earn straight As, I contacted the admissions office and then spoke to XXXX XXXX who was then the head of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and after investigation she apologized but told me that the admissions counselor had misled me and awarded resident instead of non-resident tuition and that was the best that they could do. I should have consulted an attorney, and I'm currently investigating the same here. 

After a single year at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I found that I struggled to hobble together even XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX required for a XXXX XXXX XXXX, thus necessitating a move to XXXX XXXX to complete my education. The entire reason we moved home was to have familial support in XXXXXXXX XXXX where my family lived, but now we found that we'd have to move to XXXXXXXX XXXX, where we had no familial support which vastly contributed to the failure of my marriage and ultimately in XXXX would leave me a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

The waiting list for married student housing was two years long, so the only way that we could practically continue our XXXX XXXX was by living off-campus. The employers and landlords in XXXXXXXX XXXX  in my view similarly exploit the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX population through low wages and high rents. The only way we could make our ends meet, even with public assistance in the form of foodstamps, Title XIX Medicaid, and childcare assistance, was through student loans and using debt as income to pay for our living expenses. Thus, the remainder of my student loan debt balance were the result of two predatory higher education institutions and perverse incentives that existed for admissions counselors and program representatives ( I later discovered the same was due to quota systems and commissions paid ) to profiteer from higher education, and similar federal predatory student loans. 

On this basis, I submitted two Borrower 's Defense Program applicaitons in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which are still just showing "" pending. '' I also did register for and was accepted for, and have been credited under XXXX XXXX for six years of on-time payments, and was chagrined first to apply for consolidation and then enrollment in the new SAVE Plans to see that the courts have halted the same, and have requested information about what to do. I'm more chagrined to see the Republican plan is to repeal PSLF using recess legislation, but was happy today to see that Biden has moved to forgive PSLF loans, and I pray that my loans, given my Borrower 's Defense complaints, are among those being forgiven. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but due to the bias in the court system against fathers, and despite her then interest in terminating her parenting rights, and admission, even in her divorce complaint that I should be awarded primary custody, she knew the odds were stacked against me and the price I had to pay for her was to accept the largess of the student loan debt we'd taken out under my name to pay for those living expenses. What would have been fair would have been for us to have deducted each of our fees and tuition from our loan totals, and split it down the middle but because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and working part time, and she, the opposite, I qualified for more in loans than she did, and so while we both maxxed out our loans the majority of the debt that we incurred in XXXXXXXX XXXX, was under my name. But to get my son XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the price I paid was to accept all of the debt that resulted. 

Thus, I'm hoping by filing this complaint given my multiple attempts over the last three years, and the change in administrations, and plans of Republicans ot repeal PSLF and Borrower 's Defense not by act of Congress through normal processes but by recess legislation, that you could assist me in getting my Borrower 's Defense applications XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX prioritized or escalated before XX/XX/XXXX. Further, I would humbly request if there is anything that can be done legally to preserve my claims given the change in administration and promised actions by Republicans or ensure they can be grandfathered, I've been reading in forums that if they haven't investigated within 3 years, that loans are automatically discharged to somehow extend their investigation to XXXX XXXX XXXX so that they are. 
Can you help in prioritizing or escalating my Borrower 's Defense complaints to FedAid Borrower 's Defense administrators and/or Sec of Education Sec XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to possibly getting my loans forgiven or at least a portion of them forgiven given the court halt of the SAVE plan under the recent orders for PSLF forgiveness under President Biden, and include my loans in that action?

My current student loans were in the process of being consolidated first from XXXX XXXX XXXX then to Mohela and then back to FedStudent Aid for consolidation under the SAVE plan halted by the courts. Further, I had previously had my loans consolidated at 3 % and in applying for the save plan, they were consolidated at higher interest rates ( the SAVE direct unsubsidized consolidation loan for {$68000.00} was consolidated at 4.25 % fixed, and the saved direct subsidized consolidation loan for {$25000.00} also at 4.25 % ), so if nothing can be done that way, is there a way that the interest rates can be dropped to the prior rate they were at given the courts ' actions on SAVE Plan consolidation, and can you assist in that worst case scenario? 

According to XXXX, I have 106 payments towards 120 payments for PSLF for all loans. 

I tried logging into Mohela but my username and password it says are not recognized by the system, so while Fedaid.gov shows them, somehow my account at Mohela is gone that Fedaid says is at Mohela, so I don't know how to get loan numbers and information to try to escalate this ASAP so that we can get something done about this. 

I will eagerly await your reply.

On the XXXX the notification asked for invasive amount of personal verification : front and back photo of my license, selfie front and sides, and a photo of a bank statement from an account from which I had originally transferred money into Robinhood. It seemed excessive and invasive, but wanting to free up my account, I complied. The on-screen prompt confirmed my documents would be reviewed for removing the restriction, again by XX/XX/XXXX. 

It's now XX/XX/XXXX and the account is STILL locked, with the error notification indicating the restriction date is moved out to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I tried calling Robinhood only to find only an automated recording directing callers back to the website chat to request a phone call, then disconnects. The website chat ( which seems to be only available on desktop ) does not provide a place to enter text, just to click on a pre-written response accepting the situation. 

Never has any bank withheld my money or asked for more than a 2-step verification top grant access. It seems more like an ongoing Hostage situation and is deeply inappropriate!

Regarding attachments- I advise anyone to take more screen shots than you think you need. I failed to when submitting the ridiculous documentation, or any confirmations from Robinhood ( If there were any, I don't remember ), or their XX/XX/year> promise, and 100 % regret missing those.",,ROBINHOOD MARKETS INC.,AZ,85032,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11240426

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Inaccurate Late Payment Reporting Dear CFPB, I am filing a formal complaint against TransUnion for failing to correct inaccurate information regarding late payments reported on my credit report. Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), no changes have been made to resolve this issue, in violation of both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the errors remain on my credit report. 
FCRA Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors must send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. 
15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files. This obligation has not been upheld in my case. 
TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to provide accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The incorrect reporting of late payments has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The reported late payments for this account are inconsistent and inaccurate. Specific discrepancies include : Late payments incorrectly reported for the following months : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Dates of delinquency that do not align with the accounts actual payment history. 
Reporting errors inconsistent with records from other credit bureaus. 
These errors significantly misrepresent my credit history and have negatively impacted my creditworthiness. 
Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report. 
Written confirmation of the correction. 
If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant agencies. 
I look forward to your prompt response to this matter. Please send confirmation of the corrections to the address provided above.

Despite my initial dispute filed on XX/XX/XXXX, the inaccuracies remain unresolved, causing continued harm and distress. 
The following violations have occurred in relation to this reporting : 1. Inaccurate Reporting of Late Payments : The student loan accounts were incorrectly reported with late payments during a period when the accounts were in deferment status, as documented and verified by the US Department of Education ( documentation available upon request ). The accounts should reflect a current status with no late payments. Specifically, the following dates have been inaccurately reported as late payments : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Violation of Privacy and Unauthorized Reporting Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my personal financial information. Reporting these accounts with incorrect late payments without my consent constitutes a violation of my rights.

3. Failure to Maintain Accurate Reporting Under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and complete consumer files. By continuing to report these inaccuracies after my first dispute, the credit bureaus have failed in their obligations. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The errors include late payments being reported for months when the accounts were in deferment. Specifically, there are instances of 90- and 120-day late payments listed on my credit reports for TransUnion and XXXX , despite the loans being in deferment as verified by the US Department of Education . These discrepancies have severely impacted my credit score and financial reputation.

Requested Action : Given the severity of these violations and the documented deferment status of my loans, I am formally requesting the immediate correction of these accounts from my consumer reports within 10 calendar days from the receipt of this complaint. The requested corrections include removing all late payments and ensuring the accounts reflect a current status with no delinquencies.

This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors.

Despite several requests for correction ( letters dated XXXX XXXX  ) and ( XXXX ), my requests have been ignored, violating both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ).

1. FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting on my account suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files, which has not been upheld in my case.

2. TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act emphasizes the necessity for accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The inaccurate reporting of late payments has caused undue harm to my creditworthiness.

3. Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ) : This act reinforces the responsibility of creditors to provide timely statements, preventing unfair penalties to consumers. 
I am formally requesting that the inaccurate late payment notation be removed from my credit report immediately.

Summary of Errors : Different Account Numbers : The account numbers reported by TransUnion and XXXX do not match, causing further inconsistencies. 
Inconsistent Account Rating : TransUnion reports the account as "" Closed, '' while XXXX lists it as "" Paid. '' Missing Closing Date : XXXX has not provided a closing date for the account, making it unclear when the account was finalized. 
Inconsistent Creditor Remarks : TransUnion includes remarks indicating the account is "" Closed, '' while XXXX does not provide any such remarks, adding to the lack of clarity and accuracy. 
These discrepancies, along with the erroneous late payment entries, highlight a significant failure to ensure accurate reporting and adherence to federal regulations. 
Evidence of Error : The reported late payments on this account for the following months are inaccurate and unsupported : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX These payments were either made on time or the account was in deferment during these periods, as documented by my records from the US Department of Education. Despite submitting evidence of deferment status and timely payments in my first dispute, the inaccuracies remain uncorrected. 
Violations of My Consumer Rights : 1. Unauthorized Reporting and Privacy Violation : Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my financial information. The US Department of Educations reporting of this account without a permissible purpose is a violation of my rights. Furthermore, 15 USC 6801 mandates the protection of my personal financial data, which has been breached by reporting erroneous late payments. 
2. Willful Noncompliance : The failure to correct these inaccuracies despite documented proof provided in my first dispute constitutes willful noncompliance under 15 USC 1681n, entitling me to damages.

3. Defamation and Emotional Distress : The erroneous reporting has caused significant harm to my reputation and mental well-being, amounting to defamation. 
Requested Action : I request the immediate correction of the following : Removal of all late payments reported for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Updates to reflect the accurate deferment status during these periods. 
Written confirmation that these corrections have been made.

In accordance with this law, I have provided the necessary FTC Identity Theft Report to support my claim of fraudulent activity and data breach. I recently discovered that my personal information was compromised as part of a data breach involving XXXX. As a direct result of this breach, I am now facing fraudulent collections accounts on my credit report. The unauthorized use of my personal information has led to these collections being wrongly attributed to me. Under the FCRA, specifically Section 605B, I am entitled to request the removal of these fraudulent accounts from my credit file, as they do not reflect any legitimate debt I owe. 2. Request for Immediate Removal of Fraudulent Information : Under Section 605B of the FCRA, I request that you immediately remove all accounts that were opened fraudulently or are associated with identity theft from my credit report. These accounts were not authorized by me and have been opened as a result of the data breach involving XXXX. I have included a copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report, which details the fraudulent activity and confirms the theft of my personal information. 3. Legal Timeframe for Removal : Under Section 605B of the FCRA, when a consumer submits a valid FTC Identity Theft Report, credit reporting agencies must take action to investigate and remove fraudulent accounts within 4 business days. Therefore, I request that you immediately remove these fraudulent accounts from my credit report and correct the inaccuracies. Failure to comply with this requirement will leave me no choice but to pursue further legal actions, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 4. Failure to Verify Fraudulent Accounts : As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), when a consumer disputes information on their credit report, the credit bureaus must conduct a reasonable investigation into the disputed items. However, I have reason to believe that the fraudulent accounts, stemming from the data breach, have not been properly investigated or removed. Despite my prior dispute, these accounts remain on my credit report, which is causing severe damage to my XXXX XXXX. 5. Request for Removal Due to Inaccuracy or Fraud : As these accounts are the result of identity theft and a data breach, I am requesting that you immediately remove them from my credit file in accordance with the FCRA. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), if information can not be verified or is found to be inaccurate or incomplete, it must be deleted. This includes accounts opened fraudulently due to a data breach. 6. FTC Report Submission : Enclosed with this letter is a copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report, which I filed to support my claim. According to the FCRA and guidelines of the Federal Trade Commission, this report serves as evidence that I have been a victim of identity theft and data breach, and it should be sufficient for the removal of fraudulent accounts from my credit report. I kindly ask that you complete your investigation and remove the fraudulent accounts from my credit report within 4 business days, as required by law. If you do not comply with the FCRA, I will escalate the matter by filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and may consider pursuing further legal action. Please provide written confirmation that these fraudulent accounts have been removed and that my credit report has been updated to reflect the accurate information.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Inaccurate Late Payment Reporting Dear CFPB, I am filing a formal complaint against TransUnion for failing to correct inaccurate information regarding late payments reported on my credit report. Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), no changes have been made to resolve this issue, in violation of both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the errors remain on my credit report. 
FCRA Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors must send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement.

15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files. This obligation has not been upheld in my case.

TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to provide accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The incorrect reporting of late payments has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The reported late payments for this account are inconsistent and inaccurate. Specific discrepancies include : Late payments incorrectly reported for the following months : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Dates of delinquency that do not align with the accounts actual payment history. 
Reporting errors inconsistent with records from other credit bureaus. 
These errors significantly misrepresent my credit history and have negatively impacted my creditworthiness.

Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report. 
Written confirmation of the correction. 
If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant agencies. 
I look forward to your prompt response to this matter. Please send confirmation of the corrections to the address provided above.

Summary of Errors : Different Account Numbers : The account numbers reported by TransUnion and XXXX do not match, causing further inconsistencies. 
Inconsistent Account Rating : TransUnion reports the account as "" Closed, '' while XXXX lists it as "" XXXX. '' Missing Closing Date : XXXX has not provided a closing date for the account, making it unclear when the account was finalized. 
Inconsistent Creditor Remarks : TransUnion includes remarks indicating the account is "" Closed, '' while XXXX does not provide any such remarks, adding to the lack of clarity and accuracy. 
These discrepancies, along with the erroneous late payment entries, highlight a significant failure to ensure accurate reporting and adherence to federal regulations. 
Evidence of Error : The reported late payments on this account for the following months are inaccurate and unsupported : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX These payments were either made on time or the account was in deferment during these periods, as documented by my records from the US Department of Education. Despite submitting evidence of deferment status and timely payments in my first dispute, the inaccuracies remain uncorrected. 
Violations of My Consumer Rights : 1. Unauthorized Reporting and Privacy Violation : Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my financial information. The US Department of Educations reporting of this account without a permissible purpose is a violation of my rights. Furthermore, 15 USC 6801 mandates the protection of my personal financial data, which has been breached by reporting erroneous late payments.

2. Willful Noncompliance : The failure to correct these inaccuracies despite documented proof provided in my first dispute constitutes willful noncompliance under 15 USC 1681n, entitling me to damages.

3. Defamation and Emotional Distress : The erroneous reporting has caused significant harm to my reputation and mental well-being, amounting to defamation. 
Requested Action : I request the immediate correction of the following : Removal of all late payments reported for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Updates to reflect the accurate deferment status during these periods. 
Written confirmation that these corrections have been made. 
Failure to resolve this issue within 10 calendar days will result in further escalation, including potential legal action and additional complaints to relevant authorities.

Summary of Errors : Different Account Numbers : The account numbers reported by TransUnion and XXXX do not match, causing further inconsistencies. 
Inconsistent Account Rating : TransUnion reports the account as "" Closed, '' while XXXX lists it as "" Paid. '' Missing Closing Date : XXXX has not provided a closing date for the account, making it unclear when the account was finalized. 
Inconsistent Creditor Remarks : TransUnion includes remarks indicating the account is "" Closed, '' while XXXX does not provide any such remarks, adding to the lack of clarity and accuracy. 
These discrepancies, along with the erroneous late payment entries, highlight a significant failure to ensure accurate reporting and adherence to federal regulations. 
Evidence of Error : The reported late payments on this account for the following months are inaccurate and unsupported : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX These payments were either made on time or the account was in deferment during these periods, as documented by my records from the US Department of Education. Despite submitting evidence of deferment status and timely payments in my first dispute, the inaccuracies remain uncorrected. 
Violations of My Consumer Rights : 1. Unauthorized Reporting and Privacy Violation : Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my financial information. The US Department of Educations reporting of this account without a permissible purpose is a violation of my rights. Furthermore, 15 USC 6801 mandates the protection of my personal financial data, which has been breached by reporting erroneous late payments.

Despite my initial dispute filed on XX/XX/XXXX, the inaccuracies remain unresolved, causing continued harm and distress. 
The following violations have occurred in relation to this reporting : 1. Inaccurate Reporting of Late Payments : The student loan accounts were incorrectly reported with late payments during a period when the accounts were in deferment status, as documented and verified by the US Department of Education ( documentation available upon request ). The accounts should reflect a current status with no late payments. Specifically, the following dates have been inaccurately reported as late payments : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  2. Violation of Privacy and Unauthorized Reporting Under 15 USC 1681b, I retain the right to privacy regarding my personal financial information. Reporting these accounts with incorrect late payments without my consent constitutes a violation of my rights. 
3. Failure to Maintain Accurate Reporting Under 15 USC 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and complete consumer files. By continuing to report these inaccuracies after my first dispute, the credit bureaus have failed in their obligations. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The errors include late payments being reported for months when the accounts were in deferment. Specifically, there are instances of 90- and 120-day late payments listed on my credit reports for TransUnion and XXXX XXXX despite the loans being in deferment as verified by the US Department of Education . These discrepancies have severely impacted my credit score and financial reputation.

Requested Action : Given the severity of these violations and the documented deferment status of my loans, I am formally requesting the immediate correction of these accounts from my consumer reports within 10 calendar days from the receipt of this complaint. The requested corrections include removing all late payments and ensuring the accounts reflect a current status with no delinquencies. Failure to resolve this matter will result in further escalation. 
These inaccuracies have caused significant emotional distress and damage to my creditworthiness. I demand immediate corrective action to prevent further harm. I am prepared to provide additional documentation if needed.

Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), no changes have been made to resolve this issue, in violation of both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the errors remain on my credit report. 
FCRA Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors must send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement.

15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files. This obligation has not been upheld in my case. 
TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to provide accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The incorrect reporting of late payments has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The reported late payments for this account are inconsistent and inaccurate. Specific discrepancies include : Late payments incorrectly reported for the following months : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Dates of delinquency that do not align with the accounts actual payment history. 
Reporting errors inconsistent with records from other credit bureaus. 
These errors significantly misrepresent my credit history and have negatively impacted my creditworthiness.

Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report.

Written confirmation of the correction.

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant agencies.

I look forward to your prompt response to this matter. Please send confirmation of the corrections to the address provided above.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Apparently, XXXX XXXX XXXX opened a credit card account in my name without properly verifying the actual applicant. I don't recall how I actually became aware of the account a couple of years ago ( likely I saw a credit report ). I contacted XXXX when I became aware of the account and well after it was in default. XXXX confirmed over the phone that it did not have my correct contact information in its records until I reached out to them to let them know that I never opened any account with them. XXXX however refuses to correct its error that it should not have opened the account to begin with. I called XXXX several times and also wrote them a couple of letters explaining everything to them, but they refuse to change anything. XXXX has continued to damage my credit by reporting the account as mine, which became delinquent which they eventually wrote-off. 

XXXX was completely negligent in how it issued the credit card. If it had bothered to confirm an email address or confirm a phone number, it would have known it had incorrect information, or at least have some way to trace who really opened the account. How it is possible a card issuer would not bother to at least verify contact information for someone applying for credit? And why is such a high burden placed on an innocent party to correct a card issuer 's mistake? There don't seem to be any consequences to XXXX for its negligence or unwillingness to correct its mistake, but I suffer the consequences of destroyed credit. 

After trying to get XXXX to correct the error, I reached out the credit reporting services to see if they could correct the reporting. TransUnion "" investigated '' and somehow "" verified as accurate '' the debt, but it would be impossible to confirm that it is my debt because it is not mine. ( My appeal was received the same letter in response. The "" Adverse '' information of the delinquency will remain on TransUnion 's reporting until XX/XX/XXXX unless some action is taken. ) As part of the TransUnion correspondence, I noticed another credit card account with XXXX  XXXX that I had been completely unaware of. When I called XXXX, they were unable to find any record of any account in my name or with my SS #. When I asked how is possible then that a delinquent account from XXXX would show up as "" Adverse Information '' on my credit report, the rep did not have an answer. The XXXX rep on the phone seemed like she would be taking action to correct the problem, but I don't know what is happening. ( I only discovered the XXXX account issue this week even though the account was opened in XXXX. My credit report shows the negative information will not be removed until XX/XX/XXXX unless something is done. ) In XX/XX/XXXX, I filed an Identity Theft statement with the FTC and sent it to TransUnion and XXXX. I spoke with TransUnion again by phone earlier this week, provided all the information again, but nothing has changed. The representative suggested I file a complaint with the CFPB, which is what I am doing now. 

I am guessing my name an SS # were part of a data leak ( likely through the Government Personnel Office who did a background check on me and whose data breach was massive is widely known ). Whatever the source, data leaks are extremely common and credit issuers should know this and take basic steps to confirm someone's identity before issuing credit ( the CFPB did more to confirm my contact information to use this website than the credit card issuers did for whoever opened these accounts in my name. ) In a more just world, the burden would not be placed on the victims to correct the problems that occur through credit card companies being negligent in their processes. In an even more just world there would be fines or class action suits for all the harm they cause by doing this. I am sure I am not the only one whose credit has been ruined by these bogus accounts. Despite my excellent record on my actual credit accounts, these relatively small fraud items are killers. I did not do anything wrong, but the burden is on me to keep calling giant and uncaring institutions, dealing with their automated replies, writing new letters in response, filing forms with the FTC and CFPB. How is this system fair? I was not in a position to prevent what the card companies did ( they could have prevented it ) but I am the one who gets screwed.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NV,895XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11228237

Despite several requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year> ) and ( XX/XX/year> ), my requests have been ignored, violating both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
XXXX. FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting on my account suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files, which has not been upheld in my case.

2. TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act emphasizes the necessity for accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The inaccurate reporting of late payments has caused undue harm to my creditworthiness. 

XXXX. Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ) : This act reinforces the responsibility of creditors to provide timely statements, preventing unfair penalties to consumers.

Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation of Disputed Information : On XX/XX/year>, I filed a dispute with TransUnion regarding inaccuracies in my credit report. I explicitly requested a manual review of the disputed information due to its complexity. I provided clear supporting evidence, including highlighted copies of my credit report identifying the errors. However, XXXX used the E-Oscar system to process my dispute electronically rather than conducting the manual review I requested. This process fails to ensure a thorough investigation, as required under the FCRA. 
The response I received was vague and did not provide sufficient detail regarding the methods, sources, or procedures used to verify the disputed information. My specific questions about the investigation process remain unanswered.

2. Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance by a Collection Agency : 3. Despite my dispute, XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion continue to report this collection account without verifying its validity or requiring the collection agency to issue a 1099-C. This raises questions about the legitimacy of the debt and violates federal regulations. 
Account Name Account Number XXXX XXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Key Violations : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : o XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) by failing to conduct a manual review of my dispute as explicitly requested. o The use of E-Oscar resulted in an inadequate and incomple
te investigation.

2. Failure to Provide Details of Investigation : o XXXX failed to provide the methods, sources, and documentation used in their investigation, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 4 ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ).

3. Inaccurate Reporting and Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance : o XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion continue to report inaccurate information, violating my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

o The collection agencys failure to issue a 1099-C for canceled or forgiven debt violates IRS regulations and raises concerns about the accounts validity.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,30331,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11228251

Despite several requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year> ) and ( XX/XX/year> ), my requests have been ignored, violating both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
XXXX. FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting on my account suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files, which has not been upheld in my case.

2. TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act emphasizes the necessity for accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The inaccurate reporting of late payments has caused undue harm to my creditworthiness.

3. Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ) : This act reinforces the responsibility of creditors to provide timely statements, preventing unfair penalties to consumers.

I am formally requesting that the inaccurate late payment notation be removed from my credit report immediately.

Submit documents '' This is unusual, as I have not been asked for this information from other brokers where I have accounts, but I comply.

'' I'm already skeptical about this as they haven't really taken the bank statements, but I wait until the next day.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding inaccurate and adverse information that has been reported on my credit report. Despite my efforts to resolve this matter with the consumer reporting agencies, XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion. My private information continues to appear on my credit file in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am seeking your assistance in rectifying this issue. 
1. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b and 15 U.S.C. 1681a, consumer reporting agencies are prohibited from furnishing information without the express consent of the consumer. I have not given written consent for the reporting of the account in question, nor have I authorized the financial institution that furnished this information to report it to the credit bureaus. In fact, I have revoked any such consent, as outlined below.

2. Revocation of Consent As of the date of this letter, I am formally revoking any and all consent, whether implied or explicit, to the furnishing of this information to the credit reporting agencies. I have not provided any written consent for this account to be reported. This revocation is in full accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), which requires written consent from the consumer for information to be furnished to a consumer reporting agency. As such, I request that this information be immediately removed from my credit report.

3. Failure to Inform Me of My Rights Furthermore, the furnisher of the information,, has never informed me of my right to exercise my non-disclosure option as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ). This failure to inform me of my rights violates the obligations placed upon them by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I was not notified that I could object to or limit the disclosure of this account to consumer reporting agencies, as mandated under 12 CFR 1016.7.

4. Adverse Information Continues to Be Reported Without Consent Despite my objections and revocation of consent, the adverse account information has continued to be reported by the credit bureaus, which constitutes a further violation of the FCRA. As stated in 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602, "" There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. '' The continued reporting of this account, despite the lack of my consent, represents a failure to uphold these responsibilities.

5. Request for Immediate Action I made an attempt to resolve this issue directly by sending written notice of these issues to XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX However, the information has not been removed. As such, I am now seeking the assistance of the CFPB to rectify this matter.In 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) states '' Except as authorized under subsection ( b ), no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information any other adverse item of information, other than records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than seven years. '' This account is an adverse item they are reporting without my permission.

I have attached copies of all relevant documentation, including some of my correspondence with the credit reporting agencies, as well as any relevant account details. I look forward to your investigation and resolution of this matter.

Thank you for your time and attention to this important issue.

I believe these late payments are erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 
Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments listed on my credit report for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are inaccurate. My payment history reflects consistent on-time payments, and I have been enrolled in autopay for this account. 
Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files.

Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The account reflects late payments in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which are inaccurate. 
Payment history should reflect 100 % on-time payments. 
The discrepancies misrepresent my creditworthiness and violate consumer protection laws. 
Requested Resolution : I request that Equifax conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payments from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments. 
I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of these entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Your failure to provide a satisfactory resolution to my recent CFPB complaint highlights significant compliance issues. The disputed items remain factually incorrect, unverifiable, or incomplete and must be removed without further delay. 

The specific accounts in question include : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) Your response to my complaint states updates were made to fields such as Scheduled Payment, Past Due, and Account History. However, these updates are inconsistent with the accounts actual payment history and status. The ongoing reporting of charge-offs across multiple months is not only inaccurate but also misleading, violating FCRA 1681e ( b ), which requires consumer reporting agencies to ensure maximum possible accuracy. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) You claim this account is accurately reported, yet discrepancies persist in the historical account balances, payment schedule, and charge-off date. The reported information does not align with the data provided by the furnisher or the billing records I hold, rendering it unverifiable and noncompliant with FCRA 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ).

Legal Basis for My Demands Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : Under the FCRA, you are obligated to delete unverifiable or inaccurate information within 30 days of a dispute. Failure to comply subjects your agency to statutory damages, actual damages, and legal action.

Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law ( 73 P.S. 201-1 ) : The ongoing misrepresentation of my financial obligations violates Pennsylvania state law, exposing your agency to additional liability.

My Demands I demand that the following actions be taken immediately : Delete the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX accounts from my credit report due to their inaccuracies and unverifiable nature. 

Provide written confirmation that these items have been removed within 15 days of receiving this letter. 

Deliver a detailed explanation of the investigative process and specific evidence used to justify any continued reporting of these items if you refuse deletion. 

Consequences of Non-Compliance Failure to delete these items or provide sufficient evidence of their accuracy will result in : Filing of complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Pennsylvania Attorney Generals Office. 
Pursuit of legal remedies for violations of the FCRA and Pennsylvania state law, including claims for statutory and punitive damages. 

Escalation to federal and state oversight authorities to audit your compliance procedures. 

I will not tolerate further delays or evasions. You are required by law to act promptly and accurately, and I expect full compliance with my demands. If you need additional documentation, you may contact me at the information provided above.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I have reached out to Equifax in regards to these XXXX account- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have the Equifax reporting number- XXXX -I have explained to them that these accounts are reporting inaccurate and are not reporting the same on neither credit bureau XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX, and self lender all have different late payment, different reporting date for the payments and more. I have reached out to XXXX and they confirmed they are reporting accurate but it is the credit bureaus who reports their information. My accounts with XXXX and XXXX and XXXX each had their own cfpb complaint as they verified correct but are actually wrong. I have documentation from each bureau listing different information. Equifax also did there investigation a whole back and actually verified the correct information,. These accounts need to be removed, XXXX shows a charge off for XXXX XXXXXXXX, it has actually been showing charge off for years. the credit reporting agencies overlooked that multiple times. I was recently denied due to their misleading reports. Charge off are reported once these accounts have more than one charge off.

It has come to my attention that the charge-off is being reported month after month on my payment history, which is incorrect. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negativeinformation such as a charge-off should only be reported once, corresponding to the date it was charged off. The FCRA requires that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of the information they report ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Repeatedly reporting the charge-off each month results in a misleading and inaccurate credit report, which has significantly harmed my credit score. Additionally, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the first delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ). Continuously reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reset the statute of limitations and is improper. Im also requesting payment for damages I have received due to the inaccurate reporting an misleading reports from these creditors. Under 15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance-If any credit reporting agency or furnisher willfully fails to comply with the terms of the FCRA, it is liable to the consumer for actual damages or statutory damages between {$100.00} and {$1000.00}, punitive damages, and the consumers reasonable attorneys fees and costs.

If a furnisher or credit reporting agency negligently fails to comply with the terms of the FCRA, it is liable to the consumer for actual damages and the consumers reasonable gattorneys fees and costs.

Below I will attach the supporting documents showing there information is reporting different on all three credit bureaus. an also will show how the charge off should report under fcra. I request these accounts to be removed as the creditor failed to comply with fcra laws a verified and confirmed they are reporting accurate when they are not.

I have dispute with each creditor individually with cfpb and they airfield they were reporting information an its still wrong as I provided the information below. These accounts need to be removed if not removed can pay for the damagers for non compliance. You guys have modified messed up my credit score and more each time you all willingly knowing put wrong information on my report. this needs to be removed before I take further legal action an report to other government for complaints on violating fcra laws for the consumers Below will list each bureaus and how those account report different information and wrong information.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",VA,23452,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11248132

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding inaccurate and adverse information that has been reported on my credit report. Despite my efforts to resolve this matter with the consumer reporting agencies, Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX. My private information continues to appear on my credit file in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am seeking your assistance in rectifying this issue.

1. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b and 15 U.S.C. 1681a, consumer reporting agencies are prohibited from furnishing information without the express consent of the consumer. I have not given written consent for the reporting of the account in question, nor have I authorized the financial institution that furnished this information to report it to the credit bureaus. In fact, I have revoked any such consent, as outlined below.

2. Revocation of Consent As of the date of this letter, I am formally revoking any and all consent, whether implied or explicit, to the furnishing of this information to the credit reporting agencies. I have not provided any written consent for this account to be reported. This revocation is in full accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), which requires written consent from the consumer for information to be furnished to a consumer reporting agency. As such, I request that this information be immediately removed from my credit report.

3. Failure to Inform Me of My Rights Furthermore, the furnisher of the information,, has never informed me of my right to exercise my non-disclosure option as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ). This failure to inform me of my rights violates the obligations placed upon them by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I was not notified that I could object to or limit the disclosure of this account to consumer reporting agencies, as mandated under 12 CFR 1016.7.

4. Adverse Information Continues to Be Reported Without Consent Despite my objections and revocation of consent, the adverse account information has continued to be reported by the credit bureaus, which constitutes a further violation of the FCRA. As stated in 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602, "" There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. '' The continued reporting of this account, despite the lack of my consent, represents a failure to uphold these responsibilities.

5. Request for Immediate Action I made an attempt to resolve this issue directly by sending written notice of these issues to Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX on XXXX However, the information has not been removed. As such, I am now seeking the assistance of the CFPB to rectify this matter.In 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) states '' Except as authorized under subsection ( b ), no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information any other adverse item of information, other than records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than seven years. '' This account is an adverse item they are reporting without my permission.

I have attached copies of all relevant documentation, including some of my correspondence with the credit reporting agencies, as well as any relevant account details. I look forward to your investigation and resolution of this matter. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this important issue.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Reference Accounts : XXXX I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report, pursuant to Section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, and request the immediate removal of any fraudulent accounts associated with my name and personal information. In accordance with this law, I have provided the necessary FTC Identity Theft Report to support my claim of fraudulent activity and data breach. I recently discovered that my personal information was compromised as part of a data breach involving Equifax. As a direct result of this breach, I am now facing fraudulent collections accounts on my credit report. The unauthorized use of my personal information has led to these collections being wrongly attributed to me. Under the FCRA, specifically Section 605B, I am entitled to request the removal of these fraudulent accounts from my credit file, as they do not reflect any legitimate debt I owe. 2. Request for Immediate Removal of Fraudulent Information : Under Section 605B of the FCRA, I request that you immediately remove all accounts that were opened fraudulently or are associated with identity theft from my credit report. These accounts were not authorized by me and have been opened as a result of the data breach involving Equifax. I have included a copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report, which details the fraudulent activity and confirms the theft of my personal information. 3. Legal Timeframe for Removal : Under Section 605B of the FCRA, when a consumer submits a valid FTC Identity Theft Report, credit reporting agencies must take action to investigate and remove fraudulent accounts within 4 business days. Therefore, I request that you immediately remove these fraudulent accounts from my credit report and correct the inaccuracies. Failure to comply with this requirement will leave me no choice but to pursue further legal actions, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 4. Failure to Verify Fraudulent Accounts : As per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), when a consumer disputes information on their credit report, the credit bureaus must conduct a reasonable investigation into the disputed items. However, I have reason to believe that the fraudulent accounts, stemming from the data breach, have not been properly investigated or removed. Despite my prior dispute, these accounts remain on my credit report, which is causing severe damage to my credit score. 5. Request for Removal Due to Inaccuracy or Fraud : As these accounts are the result of identity theft and a data breach, I am requesting that you immediately remove them from my credit file in accordance with the FCRA. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), if information can not be verified or is found to be inaccurate or incomplete, it must be deleted. This includes accounts opened fraudulently due to a data breach. 6. FTC Report Submission : Enclosed with this letter is a copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report, which I filed to support my claim. According to the FCRA and guidelines of the Federal Trade Commission, this report serves as evidence that I have been a victim of identity theft and data breach, and it should be sufficient for the removal of fraudulent accounts from my credit report. I kindly ask that you complete your investigation and remove the fraudulent accounts from my credit report within 4 business days, as required by law. If you do not comply with the FCRA, I will escalate the matter by filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and may consider pursuing further legal action. Please provide written confirmation that these fraudulent accounts have been removed and that my credit report has been updated to reflect the accurate information.

Attempts to Resolve : I have reached out to XXXX multiple times to inquire about this issue. 
Specifically, I have contacted XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, seeking clarification and requesting the necessary 1099-C form. 
Despite my repeated attempts, I have yet to receive a response or the requested form. The company has not provided any documentation or explanation for the charged-off status.

Impact on My Credit : The failure to provide the 1099-C form or to resolve this matter has caused confusion regarding my credit report and has left me in a state of uncertainty about the true status of my account with XXXX. 
I have made every effort to address this matter directly with XXXX, but without success. I am now seeking the assistance of the CFPB in ensuring that XXXX provides the required 1099-C form and corrects any potential inaccuracies in the reporting of this account.

Violation of FCRA ( 15 USC 1681i and 1681s-2 ) : Reporting and failing to correct inaccurate information violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Violation of FDCPA ( 15 USC 1692e ) : Reporting incorrect payment history may constitute a deceptive or misleading practice.

To clarify, I am requesting : 1. **Evidence Used for Verification : ** Please provide all documentation and evidence relied upon during the investigation, including communication with the furnisher of the information.

2. **Validation Details : ** Specific information regarding the debt, including : - The exact amount owed.

- The name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed.

- Documentation demonstrating that I am legally responsible for this debt. 
- Proof of assignment or transfer, if applicable. 
- A copy of the original contract or agreement, if available. 

Under the FCRA, you are required to ensure the accuracy and completeness of all information reported in my credit file. Simply stating that the debt was "" verified '' is insufficient without providing the requested details to substantiate the claim. 

Additionally, if you can not provide this information, I demand that this item be removed from my credit file immediately. I also request that this debt be marked as "" disputed '' until resolution is reached, as per federal law. 

If this matter is not resolved promptly and satisfactorily, I will consider filing a complaint with the CFPB, the FTC, and other relevant regulatory authorities. I reserve the right to pursue further action to protect my rights under the law.

I believe these late payments are erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 
Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments listed on my credit report for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are inaccurate. My payment history reflects consistent on-time payments, and I have been enrolled in autopay for this account. 
Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information. 
Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The account reflects late payments in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which are inaccurate. 
Payment history should reflect 100 % on-time payments. 
The discrepancies misrepresent my creditworthiness and violate consumer protection laws. 
Requested Resolution : I request that Equifax conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and remove the inaccurate late payments from my credit report. I ask that all such entries be updated to reflect my true payment history of 100 % on-time payments. 
I expect to receive written documentation confirming the removal of these entries within 30 days of this complaint submission. Failure to resolve this issue may lead to further action to protect my rights as a consumer. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), no changes have been made to resolve this issue, in violation of both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the errors remain on my credit report. 
FCRA Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors must send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. 
15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files. This obligation has not been upheld in my case. 
TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to provide accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The incorrect reporting of late payments has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The reported late payments for this account are inconsistent and inaccurate across different months and reporting periods. Specific discrepancies include : Late payments incorrectly reported for the following months : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Different late payment statuses reported across credit bureaus. 
Dates of delinquency that do not align with the accounts actual payment history. 
These errors significantly misrepresent my credit history and have negatively impacted my creditworthiness. 
Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report. 
Written confirmation of the correction. 
If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant agencies. 
I look forward to your prompt response to this matter. Please send confirmation of the corrections to the address provided above.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Late Payments on Credit Report Dear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding inaccurate late payments that are reported on my credit file maintained by Equifax. I believe these late payments are erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history. 
Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The late payments listed on my credit report for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are inaccurate. My payment history reflects consistent on-time payments, and I have been enrolled in autopay for this account. 
Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

Potential Violation of Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I assert that the reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically sections 15 U.S. Code 1681i and 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information in credit reports and ensure the maximum accuracy of information contained in consumer files. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The account reflects late payments in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which are inaccurate. 
Payment history should reflect 100 % on-time payments.

Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), no changes have been made to resolve this issue, in violation of both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the errors remain on my credit report. 
FCRA Violations : Under 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors must send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. 
15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files. This obligation has not been upheld in my case. 
TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to provide accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The incorrect reporting of late payments has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : The reported late payments for this account are inconsistent and inaccurate across different months and reporting periods. Specific discrepancies include : Late payments incorrectly reported for the following months : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Different late payment statuses reported across credit bureaus. 
Dates of delinquency that do not align with the accounts actual payment history. 
These errors significantly misrepresent my credit history and have negatively impacted my creditworthiness. 
Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report. 
Written confirmation of the correction. 
If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other relevant agencies.

FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting on my account suggests a failure to comply with this requirement.

Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files, which has not been upheld in my case.

The letter stated that you were unable to locate my credit file due to issues such as my alleged lack of credit activity, lack of application for credit, or failure to reside in the United States. This correspondence is yet another example of Equifaxs ongoing refusal and deliberate hindrance in addressing my requests, constituting further violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Despite your claims in the XX/XX/XXXX letter, I have provided Equifax with numerous verified and comprehensive identification documents through various channels, including the Equifax platform, CFPB, XXXX, and FTC. These documents include : Long-form and short-form birth certificates W-2 form with my complete Social Security Number ( SSN ) Lease agreement showing my current address Utility bills and other documents verifying my current residence The information provided clearly confirms my legal name as XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, with the XXXX always capitalized, and my current address as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX.

Your continued refusal to accurately locate, update, or maintain my credit file has caused substantial harm and is in direct violation of federal law. 

Additional Infringements Identified The correspondence dated XX/XX/year>, exacerbates the situation by demonstrating the following additional violations of the FCRA : 1. Failure to Provide Clear and Accurate Reasons for File Denial ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) : Equifax is required to disclose accurate and complete information regarding why a credit file can not be located or accessed. Your letter provided vague and contradictory reasons, such as a lack of credit activity, despite the fact that I have actively used credit and provided documentation to prove it. 
2. Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) : By issuing this letter without properly reviewing the documentation I submitted, Equifax has failed to perform the reasonable investigation mandated by the FCRA when a dispute or issue is raised by a consumer. 
3. Unjustified Delay in Resolution ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ) : It has been over 60 days since my initial dispute, yet Equifax has continued to delay resolving my credit file issues, which is well beyond the 30-day timeframe required by the FCRA. 
4. Failure to Provide Access to My File ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) : Your inability to locate my file, despite the extensive and verified documentation I provided, directly violates my right to access my own consumer credit file. 
5. Failure to Correct Inaccurate or Missing Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) : Equifax has failed to update my file with new credit accounts and transactions since XX/XX/year>, despite the availability of accurate information from other reporting agencies and the submissions I provided. 

Harm Caused by Equifaxs Negligence Your ongoing refusal to locate and update my credit file, as well as the repeated issuance of vague and incorrect correspondence, has caused me significant harm, including : Financial Damage : Multiple denials for credit due to Equifaxs inability to maintain or provide an accurate credit file. 
Business Losses : Harm to my ability to pursue business financing and professional opportunities. 
Emotional Distress : Frustration and stress caused by Equifaxs continued failure to resolve these issues despite my compliance with every request for documentation.

I believe i have a fraud alert on all my credit profiles and have had one on them for a few years. I was under the assumption that the fraud alert would help avoid these situations and in order to obtain or attempt to apply for any type of credit i would have to be notified first to give consent for any type of inquiry. To the best of my knowledge i was never contacted by any of these companies for permission nor have i ever gave any type of written consent.

Below is a summary of the actions I have taken and the ongoing issues with XXXX XXXX XXXX  handling of my personal information and credit reporting. 

Timeline of Events and Actions Taken : Debt Validation Letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent XXXX XXXX XXXX a Debt Validation letter requesting validation of the alleged debt they are attempting to collect. This is my right under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). The letter explicitly requested that XXXX XXXX XXXX provide verification of the debt, including the original creditor, the amount, and other relevant details. 
No response was received from XXXX XXXX XXXX within the required 30-day period. This lack of response is a violation of my rights under the FDCPA, which mandates that they must provide this validation before continuing any collection activities. 
Cease and Desist Letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a Cease and Desist letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX, demanding that they immediately stop accessing or reporting my personal information to credit bureaus without my consent. 
This letter also reiterated my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), which requires consumer consent before any third party can access or report my credit information. I have not given XXXX XXXX XXXX permission to obtain or report my personal or credit information. 
Despite this request, no response has been received from XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they continue to report inaccurate and unauthorized information on my credit report. 

Key Issues : Unauthorized Access and Reporting : XXXX XXXX XXXX has been reporting on my credit report without my consent. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b, they are not permitted to obtain my personal information or report it to credit bureaus without my explicit permission. Their actions are not only a violation of my privacy rights but may also constitute identity theft. 
Failure to Respond : Both my Debt Validation letter and my Cease and Desist letter were sent in good faith, requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX provide the necessary documentation and cease their unauthorized actions. However, as of today, they have failed to respond to either request, which further compounds the violation of my rights. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this complaint and confirmation that XXXX XXXX XXXX is taking the appropriate corrective actions.

Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), my requests have been ignored, violating both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the inaccuracies persist. 
FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting on my account suggests a failure to comply with this requirement.

Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consu
mer files, which has not been upheld in my case.

Reporting inaccurate information violates 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, which prohibits the reporting of incomplete or inaccurate information to credit bureaus.

Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : Account Number : XXXX. 
High Balance : {$0.00} ( discrepant from other bureaus ).

Balance Owed : {$170.00}. 
Date of Last Payment : XX/XX/XXXX. 
Two-Year Payment History : Late payments inaccurately reported for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Account Description : Secured credit card, marked as "" Amount in H/C column is credit limit, '' but conflicting details in payment timelines and balances. 
Impact on Creditworthiness : The discrepancies in the reporting by Equifax have caused significant damage to my creditworthiness, leading to denial of financial opportunities and undue stress. Accurate and complete information is critical for fair treatment in financial decisions.

Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report. 
Written confirmation of the correction.

Assurance that the reporting will be accurate and consistent moving forward.

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with relevant agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).

Despite multiple requests for correction ( letters dated XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  ), my requests have been ignored, violating both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Since my last dispute, nothing has changed, and the inaccuracies persist. 
FCRA Violations : According to 1

5 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting on my account suggests a failure to comply with this requirement.

Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files, which has not been upheld in my case. 
Reporting inaccurate information violates 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, which prohibits the reporting of incomplete or inaccurate information to credit bureaus. 
Summary of Errors and Discrepancies : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Two-Year Payment History : Late payments inaccurately reported for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Account Description : Secured credit card, marked as "" Amount in H/C column is credit limit, '' but conflicting details in payment timelines and balances. 
Impact on Creditworthiness : The discrepancies in the reporting by Equifax have caused significant damage to my creditworthiness, leading to denial of financial opportunities and undue stress. Accurate and complete information is critical for fair treatment in financial decisions.

Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of the inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report. 
Written confirmation of the correction. 
Assurance that the reporting will be accurate and consistent moving forward. 
If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint further, including potential legal action and filing additional complaints with relevant agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).

I have all the paperwork for my claim submission ; however, they continue to deny my compensation. The Equifax settlement operator insists that I am not part of the settlement. At one point, I was told they couldn't find my claim, and then I was informed that it was submitted after the due date, despite my claim clearly stating that it was submitted on XX/XX/XXXX, well before the XX/XX/XXXX deadline for paperwork submission. 

Additionally, I have proof that I was impacted by the breach, but they will not accept my evidence, which includes the dates filed, the receipt received, and all corresponding emails. It is frustrating that I can demonstrate my claim was filed before the deadline, yet they refuse to recognize it. 

Why won't Equifax take responsibility for their wrongdoing, especially when the documentation clearly shows that my claim was submitted on time?

I have yet to receive a satisfactory response or proof of the debt as required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). As per my initial request, I sought validation of this debt, including documentation such as my signature or a contract to verify its legitimacy. To date, no such verification has been provided. 
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are required to ensure that all information reported on my credit file is accurate, verifiable, and complete. As the debt in question has not been properly validated, I assert that it is inaccurate and unverifiable. 
Additionally, Section 809 of the FDCPA mandates that a debt collector must validate a debt when requested by the consumer, and failure to do so results in the debt being considered invalid. Since no proper validation has been provided, this debt should be removed from my credit report.

Therefore, I request the immediate deletion of this collection account from my credit report. Failure to comply with this request will leave me no choice but to pursue legal action under both the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which can lead to significant penalties for non-compliance.

Please update me on the status of this dispute within 30 days, as required by law. If this account is not deleted, I will consider taking further action, including filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seeking legal recourse.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I expect a resolution in accordance with the law.

In early XXXX, I brought my account to a zero balance and each month began paying the statement balance in full to avoid any additional fees or interest. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I experienced an issue in which I was going to be delayed in making the full statement balance payment by one day. I contacted Capital One in advance regarding this. A supervisor committed to refunding the interest charged but advised he could not do so until it officially posted after the next statement was issued, and he advised to call back then. 
I made the minimum payment on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. I paid the statement balance on XX/XX/XXXX. When the next statement was issued, I had been charged {$20.00} in interest. 
I therefore called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX for the promised refund. Capital One customer service said it was not authorized to issue any refund. I asked for a supervisor, who denied they had said they would refund the interest and also denied the promised refund. 
Furthermore, Capital One 's supervisor stated that Capital One would now charge me interest for XXXX months, rather than just one, even though I had already scheduled a payment for the statement balance for the XX/XX/XXXX payment due, AND had already paid the full statement balance for the prior month. 
How is this legal? 

Also, Capital One randomly has a "" XXXX XXXX '' interest rate that I have been charged for non-XXXX XXXX purchases. I have never taken a XXXX XXXX from this credit card. Yet I have been charged this rate, which is nearly 30 % APR. Capital One wrongly classifies purchases made to non-US merchants as XXXX XXXX, even when the merchant does not appear to be outside the XXXX and is clearly an online purchase. Capital One also charges XXXX XXXX fees for purchases made using apps like XXXX or XXXX, even when they are not a XXXX XXXX, but a purchase of goods or services.

I have previously notified you of the inaccuracies, yet no corrective action has been taken. This ongoing violation of federal law demonstrates negligence and disregard for your legal responsibilities. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, you are legally obligated to ensure that all information you report is accurate, complete, and verifiable. Specifically : 1 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Credit reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy in the information they report. 
2 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) : Upon notice of a dispute, you are required to conduct a prompt and thorough reinvestigation to verify or remove the contested information.

3 15 U.S.C. 1681n : Noncompliance with the FCRA subjects you to civil liability, including actual damages, statutory damages of {$1000.00} per violation, punitive damages, and attorney fees. 
In addition to your violations of the FCRA, multiple court rulings have affirmed the illegality of reporting inaccurate or unverified XXXX XXXX  accounts to credit bureaus : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX United States ( XXXX ) : The court ruled that the federal government wrongfully reported XXXX XXXX arrears to credit bureaus and ordered the records expunged. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : The court found that the XXXX XXXX agency violated the paying parents due process rights by reporting arrears without proper notice. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX ) : The court reversed a decision to report XXXX XXXX  arrears due to a lack of evidence and improper procedures. 

I have solid evidence that the XXXX XXXX  account information you are reporting is false and was provided without proper verification or notice. I have never provided my consent for this account to be reported, which is an additional violation of my rights. 

As a result of your continued failure to comply with federal law, I have suffered significant harm, including financial damages and emotional distress. Therefore, I am demanding : 1 Immediate removal of the inaccurate XXXX XXXX account from my credit report. 
2 Payment of {$1000.00} in statutory damages per bureau for failing to comply with the FCRA, payable to me at the address listed above. 

If you fail to comply with this demand, I will have no choice but to initiate litigation against all three credit bureaus for willful violations of the FCRA and associated damages. In court, I will seek the maximum allowable damages, including statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees. 

This is your final notice. I strongly urge you to take this matter seriously and fulfill your legal obligations. Contact me via email only.

This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

There has never been any attempt to serve any papers to my legal residence, e-mail, or even via newspaper notice as allowed by XXXX XXXX XXXX. They simply reported it to a collection agency that has been updating my reports monthly with increased balances under two different names. The amount began at {$8900.00} in XX/XX/year> and is currently at {$10000.00}. Columbia Debt Recovery is the name they use for XXXX and XXXX, they report this to XXXX under Genesis Credit. Both of these entities are at the same contact info ( address and phone numbers ) in Washington state. 

when I was first aware of the collection, I asked them for this information directly so I could dispute it, which was ignored. I then asked them to stop contacting me, which was respected until earlier this year when they began calling and emailing me again. 

The landlord filed this in retaliation after refusing to make the apartment legally habitable during the covid quarantine. there is endlesss email correspondence back and forth asking for the repairs to be made. they were ignored and money was withheld from the rent in increasing amounts over the course of 6-7 months. complaints with the city were filed but no inspections were being done during the lockdown, nor was it possible for me to arrange any repairs or even move out of the unit. All of this is in email, along with their acknowledgment of owing me thousands of dollars after stealing my property from their on site storage service that only they had access to, they agreed to pay me and then decided not to. 

If a lawsuit was legally filed, they would lose and be countersued for damages. instead they filed these false reports in retaliation which has now made it impossible for me to rent with it on my record. 

The XXXX XXXX  is owned by the XXXX XXXX in XXXX Illinois where I am a resident. this out of state company using two different entities to falsely report amounts that are not owed by me nor allowed as collection fees per law.

Furthermore, As apart of the contract I signed with XXXX there was an arbitration agreement, which clearly stipulates that any dispute must be resolved through arbitration due to the binding agreement. To date there has been no arbitration proceedings. 

I am writing to formally notify you that your attempts to collect on the alleged debt referenced above are in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 USC 16921692p. If you are not aware this entire claim is regulated by the aforementioned arbitration agreement with XXXX which clearly stipulates that any dispute must be resolved through arbitration due to the binding agreement.

As a direct result of that this is considered a material breach of the arbitration terms listed in the original agreement acknowledged by all involved parties. I confidently assert that you have no right to collect on this alleged debt. 

I am writing this as I humbly seek to have this discrepancy resolved both promptly and amicably. 

With that, my demands are as follows : 1. You must promptly notify any credit reporting agency to remove all information and/or tradelines associated with this account. I request a written confirmation of that communication to be sent to the address you have on file ; 2. A settlement agreement that I may retain for my records. 
3. Monetary compensation in the amount of {$1000.00}.

While I do not desire or anticipate that your negligence may force me to purse further legal action, that option will be explored. In the event that needs to happen, you are subject to a significant increase in demands to cover damages, attorney fees, and more.

XXXX XXXX, MN XXXX RE : Notice of Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Dear I.C.Systems, Inc., I am writing to formally notify you that your attempts to collect on the alleged debt referenced above are in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 USC 16921692p. If you are not aware this entire claim is regulated by an arbitration agreement with XXXX XXXX, which clearly stipulates that any dispute must be resolved through arbitration due to the binding agreement. To date there has been no arbitration proceedings. As a direct result of that this is considered a material breach of the arbitration terms listed in the original agreement acknowledged by all involved parties. I confidently assert that you have no right to collect on this alleged debt. 

I am writing this as I humbly seek to have this discrepancy resolved both promptly and amicably. 

With that, my demands are as follows : 1. You must promptly notify any credit reporting agency to remove all information and/or tradelines associated with this account. I request a written confirmation of that communication to be sent to the address you have on file ; 2. A settlement agreement that I may retain for my records. 
3. Monetary compensation in the amount of {$1000.00}. 

While I do not desire or anticipate that your negligence may force me to purse further legal action, that option will be explored. In the event that needs to happen, you are subject to a significant increase in demands to cover damages, attorney fees, and more. I am sure a company of your caliber does not look to unreasonably be exposed to those routes. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. We look forward to resolving this issue promptly. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX.

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intervene to resolve this issue and ensure that this company is held accountable for its actions. 

Background and Violations : On XXXX, I discovered that Pacific Credit Services had sold my personal information, including my Social Security Number ( SSN ), address, and other sensitive financial details, to an external collection agency without my consent. This action not only constitutes an invasion of my privacy but also violates several consumer protection laws, including but not limited to : The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 16921692p ) : The unauthorized sale of my debt to a third-party collection agency is an illegal practice. Debt collectors are required to have express consent before taking any action regarding consumer debt. The sale of personal information without my consent is an unlawful practice under this Act. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : Pacific Credit Services actions are also in violation of the FCRA, which mandates that companies must handle personal and financial information with care and only share it under very specific conditions. The unauthorized transfer of my debt and personal information constitutes a violation of my rights to privacy and accuracy under this law. 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 68016809 ) : This law requires that financial institutions establish privacy safeguards to protect personal financial information. The sale of my personal data to third parties without my consent is a clear violation of these privacy protections. 
California Consumer Privacy Act ( CCPA ) ( if applicable ) : If this issue involves a California resident, the CCPA prohibits the unauthorized sale of personal data and provides consumers with the right to request the deletion of their personal information from companies databases. 
Request for Action : Given the serious nature of these violations, I am requesting that the CFPB take the following actions : Investigate the illegal sale of my debt and personal information by Pacific Credit Services.

Require Pacific Credit Services to delete all records of this sale from my credit report and any records of my personal information being shared with a third party.

Ensure that Pacific Credit Services takes corrective action, including the removal of any outstanding debt associated with the sale of my personal information and ensuring that this data is not further sold or shared without my express permission. 
Consider enforcing penalties for violations of the FDCPA, FCRA, and GLBA, including potential fines or sanctions for their unlawful practices. 
Demand a formal response from Pacific Credit Services acknowledging the violation and providing proof that the debt has been removed from my credit report and deleted from the collection agencys records.

Penal Codes and Consequences : The unauthorized sale of my personal data and debt may result in significant penalties for Pacific Credit Services, including but not limited to : Civil penalties of up to {$1000.00} for each violation under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 
Actual and punitive damages under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) for mishandling and misreporting my financial information. 
Substantial fines and penalties under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) for violating privacy protections concerning consumer data.

Given the illegal actions taken by Pacific Credit Services, I am asking the CFPB to take prompt and decisive action to remedy the situation and ensure that my rights as a consumer are fully protected.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"On XX/XX/year> a disputed was filed for XXXX and XXXX to correct inaccuracies on credit files. On XX/XX/year> on Credit Karma website a dispute was also filed due to hard inquiries, 2 closed accounts ( XXXX XXXX ) that are unknown accounts that I do not own. 

On Credit Karma website states a dispute does not change score. Within hours my credit score was dropped and stated XXXX dropped score and this is why it changed on credit karma. After logging into XXXX I seen that there was no change in XXXX site only on Credit Karma. 

Credit Karma is in violation of FCRA : 15 USC 1666d 1. Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Under Section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( A ) of the FCRA, it is unlawful for any credit reporting agency or bureau to report inaccurate or incomplete information on a consumers credit report. Specifically, accounts that have been charged off and are no longer active should not display open balances. The FCRA mandates that all credit reporting must reflect accurate, up-to-date information about the consumers accounts. Since both of these accounts have been closed and charged off, it is unlawful for them to still show open balances.

2. Inaccuracy in Reporting Closed Accounts The practice of continuing to report open balances on closed, charged-off accounts violates both the FCRA and other consumer protection statutes that require accurate credit reporting. Under FCRA Section 605 ( a ), negative information such as a charge-off is only allowed to remain on the report for a limited time ( typically seven years ), and only if the information is correct and reflective of the actual account status. In my case, the ongoing reporting of these charged-off accounts with open balances is an inaccurate reflection of the current status of these accounts.

3. The Inaccuracy of Reporting Charged-Off Accounts Furthermore, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), it is illegal to report accounts that have been sold, transferred, or charged off as still being active or open when they are not. XXXX  sale of my account to XXXXXXXX XXXX does not mean that the account should remain open or continue to show a balance. The status should reflect the final charge-off and XXXX balance as a result of the sale. 
4. The Legal Requirement for Accurate Reporting The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) also mandates that all consumer information reported to credit bureaus must be accurate and timely. The ongoing misrepresentation of these accounts as having an open balance, despite being charged off, creates false information about my financial history, which can lead to unwarranted harm to my creditworthiness.",,Credit Karma,NC,283XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,No,,11243076

This debt is listed on my credit report as written off, profit loss, and charged off.

Please remove and delete off all reporting credit bureaus. 

Due to the FCRA all information being furnished should be 100 % accurate especially if its coming from the same furnisher. 
This is grounds for removal. 
This has caused damage to my credit report.

The account was Charged off and Written off in the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Exeter Finance sold my account to XXXX XXXX XXXX without my consent. I found this information out by contacting Exeter Finance to make a Payment. I wasn't aware of what happen because I was never notified Both Exeter Finance And XXXX XXXX was both reporting on my credit at the same time for the same debt. When I asked Exeter Finance to remove themselves from my reporting they informed me that they couldn't and it didn't go against the Law. However that was inaccurate. I Showed Exeter Finance that the debt was paid in full they told me that it is not in their authority to delete the credit reporting that the credit bureaus are responsible for the removal. 

I contacted the IRS in XX/XX/XXXX because I was informed that when Exeter Finance written off the Debt I was suppose to receive a 1099 form to file it on my taxes as taxable income. I never received the 1099 form. Exeter Finance has acted as if they don't know what I am talking about. I sent many letters to them and have proof of my reporting that they written the full amount off and failed to send me my 1099 form. instead of giving me the chance to file it on my taxes they sold it to another company making me pay more money out as well as damaging my credit. Exeter Finance doesn't want to hold themselves responsible for the damages they caused.

My card was declined. I tried to get money out of my savings and it was declined. My VA protected income which is deposited into these accounts couldnt be accessed and my account was frozen/locked. I was told a letter would be sent to me and no one would tell me what happened at the bank in customer service. I got a letter in my inbox in the USAA app saying the bank had randomly decided to stop doing business with me and that they were going to be closing the account within 60 days and that any funds coming into the account would be accepted by the bank but held and at the end of the closure the bank would send out a check to my home address. 

I called the bank and asked to talk to XXXX  members relations.. XXXX and talked to a XXXX and XXXX XXXX who stated that they had assigned a members advocacy team member who could help us get some answers and we would hear from that person in a few minutes several hours went by and we never got a call.

I contacted my payroll to try and stop my paycheck and my wives from coming into the account from XXXX as well as called the VA and I was told that the checks from XXXX and the VA were cut early on the XXXX of XXXX due to the holiday. 

I was supposed to be on vacation at XXXX XXXX with my kids and family as their XXXX present this year and now there is nothing my kids are opening or getting for XXXX.

My wife and Is credit is going to be ruined over this and we need to maintain our credit for our job with XXXX. I had to call my XXXX security and involve my entire command.. pulling people off leave so that the XXXX XXXX was aware of what was happening to our bank right now. 

I have no idea what is going on. I filed some disputes due to my card being stolen and used by a punk teenage friend of my daughters. I have evidence of the merchants being talked to about the situation and the banks investigations are either pending or have come back favorable. 

I havent been asked for any of my documents to help with anything pending, I havent been called or anything! My wife checked her records and emails and documents and she also does not have any information or missed calls. 

As a consumer, veteran, and customer who has been with USAA for 15 years this has severely impacted my ability to survive for the next XXXX days. Right now I am having to borrow money from friend and family and ask for help beyond measure. Its embossing and I feel like the bank has comiited highway robbery with my money. 

From a business standpoint I understand the bank is protecting itself and is conducting investigations or finalizing disputes but I have {$4000.00} in savings and {$7500.00} in checking as of next week when my checks post from XXXX and the XXXX which they will.

On XX/XX/XXXX we spoke to a XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). He apologized for the tardiness of the responses and stasted that he was going to get the full money funded to us since it barely met the criteria they usue to handle cases in such a manner. I resent him the XXXX proposals as requested ( replying to his email ) on XX/XX/XXXX only to have the emasil returned as no longer a valid email inbox. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I then called to speak to a XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). She asked me to send the same documents that had been submitted to her and she would get with a XXXX and have them call me to finalize the situation. I have yet to receive a call back.

From : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : Mohela Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to address an ongoing issue regarding the servicing of my federal student loans.

Despite my repeated requests to ensure that all current and future loans are placed in the available XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  plan, and that my loans never be placed in forbearance, these preferences have not been upheld by Mohela, XXXX, nor via XXXX, XXXX is required under federal regulations. I have consistently recertified my eligibility for the XXXX plan and expect that this process be followed without deviation for all existing and future loans. I have consolidated all of my loans ( as these are all eligible for consolidation under federal law ), and recertified my XXXX plan. Confirm that this has been processed. 

Under 20 U.S. Code 1087e of the Higher Education Act of 1965, you are required to honor my request to be placed in the XXXX plan, as this is the repayment option that aligns with my financial situation. 

The XXXX plan remains in place and I have selected it as my preference every time and yet I received this erroneous ( and potentially illegal ) email : A federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and some other XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) plans. As a result of this ruling, XXXX has directed MOHELA to put your account into a forbearance because either : 1. You are currently a borrower on SAVE.

2. 60 days have passed since we received your XXXX application, and it has not yet been processed. 
You can find more information at studentaid.gov/saveaction. 

The electronic notification, which can be found in your MOHELA account, provides more information. [ note that the portal does not allow my login ] I am not on XXXX. I am on XXXX, which I have been for years and therefore neither stipulation applies. My loans, all of them, must therefore continue on XXXX, which I recertify annually as per regulations. 

Under federal regulations, you are required to honor my request to be placed in the XXXX plan, as this is the repayment option that aligns with my financial situation. Furthermore, I expect all of my loans to remain within the XXXX plan and for my repayment schedule to reflect my income and family size, with no interruption or automatic placement in forbearance, unless explicitly requested by me. Any deviation from this ( including placement on forebearance, or failure to process XXXX as is in place ) is a violation of my rights as a borrower, and I will pursue further legal action if this matter is not addressed immediately. 

Additionally, I would like to formally remind you that my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) eligibility must be taken into consideration when managing my loans. As you are aware, XXXX  requires specific repayment and certification procedures that must be followed, and I request that my loans are handled in a way that ensures my eligibility is maintained. 

Please note that I can only be contacted by email at XXXX. I do not accept communications via phone or mail. I expect a prompt and clear written response regarding my concerns and a confirmation that my loans have been properly placed in the XXXX plan moving forward. 

If this issue is not resolved within XXXX business days from the date of this letter, I will consider further action to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations and my preferences regarding loan management. 

Your online login portal does not work. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue.

2024-12-21,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"Under Section 910 of EFTA, Financial institutions have a responsibility to their customers under any circumstances to maintain any amount of money transfer. 

Different from online virtual competitors, where you are simply trading the equivalent of virtual credits, Zelle was actual account to account transfer. It was suppose to cut out the need for a third-party dark pool, And it was FDIC insured . So if the financial institution had an issue, and that aforementioned section 910 became applicable, your customer would not lose such money. 

Heres the problem. We can pull inspiration from the collapse of XXXX XXXX. The financial institutions had to come together and set up a pool of money. They also had to drain the existing insurance account and refill it. 

When you look at the type of money missing from Zelle, assuming your standard {$250000.00}, you get about XXXX customers from the $ XXXX that is missing. Its actually a lot more customers than that because most transactions arent even close to {$250000.00}. 

Our existing Insurance, FDIC, XXXX, and NCUA, they arent enough, overlap. They all accomplished generally the same thing. For the same people. And same companies. Just for different reasons. And generally are not funded with enough money to get the job done. Thats the need for the executive fund to save the failing regional banks. Which is a good solution to me, taking it from the decision maker. 

Integration of account to account transfers and efficient insurance safety nets into our XXXX centralized baking system is ideal. Allowing for-profit competitors to drive such decisions, instead of having them privatizing the necessary infrastructure, can destabilize an otherwise balanced action. 

XXXX Tells us that these financial institutions have a responsibility. Beyond just their shareholders, beyond just their interest, beyond their loan rates. To expect your customers, the taxpayer, or the shareholder, to refill the insurance, that bail out the banks, for decisions that the bank executives make, is inappropriate. Furthermore, these fiduciaries, whether the executive or business itself, get bonuses and incentives for things like increased transfers and holdings which having said service would do. 

XXXX XXXX, My fear with Zelle, and her competitors, is that we are violating 5 CFR 2635.702, and 7 usc 9, and most importantly 18 usc 666 These XXXX financial institutions and its competitors have a responsibility due to the public funding they receive in order to maintain this banking system for us. 

So now Anyone whos lost money in this environment has a claim against those companies. For breach of fiduciary responsibility. For breach of financial institution and transactional responsibility. For breach of personal and public commerce responsibility But! by driving away this account to account transfer in order for the executives or the company to avoid liability, we are prioritizing other third-party transaction companies. Businesses like debit and credit card processing. Also uninsured Credits virtual currency trading that do not have fair market collateral value and violate 31 usc 5103. 

In certain cases, you can see where these third-party transactional companies and virtual credits, be that XXXX or XXXX ( the dark pools and virtual credits used to facilitate the transaction ), show to actually unbalance the system. They practically operate as ancillary currency. Which makes commerce difficult when you have to use one currency to get to the second currency in order to pay for the third thing.

In all of this something thats gone unanswered are companies like XXXX. In my life, I prefer external account set up rather than something like XXXX  and XXXX. Many customers use these third-party transactional companies to connect banks and connect finances. Forcing me to sell my financial transactions to this third-party, Just to simply access my money. 

Restricting currency transfers and account to accounts transfers in any capacity, or prioritizing data driven profit, would manipulate the market and stabilize our supposedly balanced XXXX XXXX 

I would be concerned our decision-makers ( who are allowed to make decisions that are equivalent to insider trading ) could easily manipulate the actual investment banks that run the stock market, our retirement accounts, our financial institutions, the tradables like currencies, commodities, and crypto. prioritizing existing XXXX XXXX companies who are poised to make money off of the sale of customers data, rather than prioritizing, safe and secure transactions That support a balanced global financial network. 

This concern extends to Under 53 usc 30114 ( a ) ( 2 ), where campaign contributions can be used for official acts of these decision-makers. Many of the aforementioned Government contracts and traded securities, Lobby for this exact reason. Its easy to see where our decision-makers can get Swayed into making the wrong decision in order to get reelected. Luckily, our laws protect them and us from that natural phenomenon that lobbyist, XXXX, and campaign contributors take advantage of. 

I dont wan na worry about my retirement account because someone elses bank couldnt figure out how to transfer a couple XXXX dollars properly. 

And I certainly Dont want it to be more difficult to spend, transfer, and receive Currency because I have to integrate a data Point- a data point of my personal information, that Im not even getting paid for. 

And lastly, I do not want to compromise an otherwise balanced system, in order to incentivize an executive, or reelect a politician, Or manipulate a share price.",,"Early Warning Services, LLC",NY,121XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11244289

The call from XXXX XXXX occurred on XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/year>, at XXXXXXXX XXXX, from the number XXXX. The call lasted XXXX minutes and XXXX seconds, and the conversation was recorded. This recording can easily be retrieved to verify the statements made by XXXX XXXX, which were misleading and inaccurate. As a XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX should be fully aware of the legal protections provided to consumers under Missouri state law and federal law, yet she provided incorrect and misleading information. 

Violation of Consumer Protection Laws : In addition to the violations of the Missouri Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ), XXXX XXXX 's actions also violate the Missouri XXXX XXXX XXXX, specifically under Section XXXX, which prohibits unfair and deceptive practices in trade or commerce. By misleading me about my obligations after the sale of the vehicle and continuing to report false information, XXXX XXXX has engaged in deceptive practices, which are unlawful under this statute. 

Additionally, as per Missouri Revised Statutes, Section XXXX, any sale proceeds from a surrendered vehicle must be applied to the debt owed, and the consumer must be notified of any remaining balance. If the debt has been fully satisfied by the sale, there should be no further financial obligation on my part. 

XXXX Violations : This account is still being reported as having late payments on my credit report, despite the fact that the vehicle was sold and the loan should have been settled. This reporting of false information to the credit agencies is a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Under the FCRA, creditors are required to report accurate and up-to-date information to credit reporting agencies. By failing to properly notify the credit agencies about the sale of the vehicle and continuing to report late payments, XXXX XXXX is in violation of the law. 

Specifically, under FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ), furnishers of information ( like XXXX XXXX ) must ensure that the information provided to the credit bureaus is accurate. The continued reporting of late payments when the debt should have been satisfied is a clear error, and I am requesting immediate correction. 

Request for Immediate Action : Given the misleading information provided, the violation of legal rights, and the continued inaccurate reporting to the credit agencies, I am requesting the following actions be taken immediately : A full investigation into the matter, including a review of the statements made by XXXX XXXX and the recorded phone call on XX/XX/year>. 

XXXX removal of the account from my credit report if it has been inaccurately reported as still owing the full balance after the sale. 

A full explanation and documentation of how the sale proceeds were applied to my debt. 

Additionally, I am requesting that this account be removed immediately due to the intentionally misleading practices of XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a Senior Compliance Analyst, XXXX XXXX should have been fully aware of the legal protections provided to consumers under both Missouri XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, yet she provided incorrect and misleading information, which I believe was intentional. This deceptive conduct has violated my rights as a consumer, and as a result, the account should be removed from my credit report immediately. 

I also request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate this matter immediately to ensure that XXXX XXXX is held accountable for these illegal actions. The misleading information and failure to properly report the sale of the vehicle have caused significant harm, and I believe it is necessary for the CFPB to take swift action in this case. 

Despite my previous communications, XXXX XXXX has continued to falsify information regarding my account. They reported the vehicle as a voluntary surrender in 2024, yet my credit report has listed it as a voluntary surrender for years I have proof. The vehicle was sold years ago, but XXXX XXXX failed to report the sale or update my consumer report, intentionally misrepresenting my debt for years. Even after the CFPB getting involved, it clearly shows from the response that was sent the company feels above the law with no respect for THE CFPB, CONSUMERS OR AGENCIES by intentionally failing to report correct information for years on my consumer report. The company has failed to act and continues to prolong the situation, showing a clear disregard for federal and state laws. The phone conversation I had with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year> from phone number XXXX ( lasting XXXX minutes and XXXX seconds ) shows that the company has no intention of following the law, and their actions suggest an attempt at intentional fraud. They have had more than enough time to correct these issues, but have failed to do so, causing ongoing harm and violating my rights under consumer protection laws. 

Given Credit Acceptance 's intentional misrepresentation of my account, their failure to update my credit report, and their ongoing violations of federal and state laws despite multiple notifications, a monetary penalty is necessary to compensate for the financial harm caused to me and to ensure accountability, while also deterring similar misconduct by other companies, with penalties enforceable by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Missouri Attorney General, and the credit reporting agencies. 

All information I requested may be delivered via email! 

I look forward to your prompt response and resolution within XXXX business days given that your company has had years to fix this! I request this account be deleted immediately offer my consumer report in return do to this damaging situation!

I initially attempted a transfer of {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and got a message that Chase had declined the transfer. I immediately called the bank and was told by customer service that the hold was just a security check and they verified my identity and my phone number with two-factor verification and said it was released to try again. He also told me that the limit on my debit card ( apparently Chase routes all cash withdrawals through your debit card ) was {$5000.00} per day so that I could do the entire {$3000.00} I wanted to withdraw in a single transaction. However two additional attempts were also declined.I requested to speak with a supervisor who told me that it might take some time for the release to go through and that I should try again the next day. My internet was down the next day so I reattempted the transfer the following day, XX/XX/XXXX when it was again declined. I called customer service who transferred me to fraud protection whom they said could easily get the hold on the card released. However, the fraud protection woman told me that they would not release the card to allow me to transfer funds to my Apple Cash card on my phone because Chase Had had many instances of fraud relating to transactions between the Apple Cash card and the bank even though there have been no allegations of fraud on my account and I had no problem doing the same type of transaction last XXXX. I even showed that I was able to transfer money from my Apple Cashcard into my checking account with no problem so obviously they were still conducting transactions between the two. Her response was to start screaming at me that there was nothing I could do to get the bank to allow me to transfer my money to my Apple Cash card. She suggested I travel to the nearest Chase Bank and use their ATM. I explained that the nearest Chase Bank was a XXXX mile trip. from my home in a rural part of the XXXX XXXX but even that would not have been a solution because the purpose of my withdrawal was to subsequently transfer portions of it to my grandchildren as holiday gifts.

I told her that the supervisor on my last call told me that the card would be cleared. So she started screaming at me and saying theres nothing you can do except go to an ATM and pull out cash with that debit card, since we are entitled to decide to whom you can transfer your funds and she slammed the phone down. ( by the way between the two times I called the bank. I did attempt to make the transfer directly from my bank account to the cash card via the mobile app on my phone, but Chase responded with a message that I was required to use a debit card to transfer money between my account and any mobile apps Then they declined the transfer again after I did it through the debit card )",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,124XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11243982

I had to take a last minute work trip scheduled for XXXX  ( and as a new employee, don't have a corporate card yet ), so I made a payment on my card to clear up funds to pay for travel expenses that are best put on a credit card ( and sometimes MUST be put on a credit card ) like the hotel and care rental. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment of {$2700.00}, bringing my balance {$730.00}, which should have left me with {$2700.00} in available credit. My USAA says it was credited on XX/XX/XXXX, and the checking account I paid with ( XXXXXXXX XXXX ) shows the funds being paid out on XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, and I still only have {$16.00} in available credit. When I called USAA, they stated the funds were on a "" standard hold '' of 16 days, and the funds would be released XX/XX/XXXX. *thankfully* I was able to still pay for rental car/hotel with my debit card, but I'm essentially out {$2700.00} in funds, while traveling, over the holidays. They have done this to me previously, about a XXXX day hold, but they've also credited payments on the same day. 

Their "" payment conditions '' listed on every credit card statement stated "" payments that we accept that do not meet the above requirements will be credited within 5 days. We reserve the right to withhold credit availability until we confirm receipt of good funds. '' They clearly received funds when my bank released them on XX/XX/XXXX, and there is no way, in XXXX, it takes a bank 15 days to verify that these are "" good funds. '' I have been a customer with them for over 25 years. I have used this card with them before. I did not make multiple payments in a row that might trigger an additional hold. They had already received the funds. A 16 day hold is absolutely unreasonable, and it is impossible, as a customer, to be able to utilize this service with confidence when I don't know if I'll have funds availability the same day or in over two weeks!

Additionally, the account was reported as a profit loss by your institution, and I am seeking the necessary documentation for my records and potential tax purposes.

Please provide the 1099-C form for this account at your earliest convenience, as it is essential for my personal tax filings. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.",,"Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.",MN,554XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11232162

I have yet to receive a satisfactory response or proof of the debt as required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). As per my initial request, I sought validation of this debt, including documentation such as my signature or a contract to verify its legitimacy. To date, no such verification has been provided. 
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are required to ensure that all information reported on my credit file is accurate, verifiable, and complete. As the debt in question has not been properly validated, I assert that it is inaccurate and unverifiable. 
Additionally, Section 809 of the FDCPA mandates that a debt collector must validate a debt when requested by the consumer, and failure to do so results in the debt being considered invalid. Since no proper validation has been provided, this debt should be removed from my credit report. 
Therefore, I request the immediate deletion of this collection account from my credit report. Failure to comply with this request will leave me no choice but to pursue legal action under both the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which can lead to significant penalties for non-compliance. 
Please update me on the status of this dispute within 30 days, as required by law. If this account is not deleted, I will consider taking further action, including filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seeking legal recourse. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I expect a resolution in accordance with the law.

Below is a summary of the actions I have taken and the ongoing issues with LVNV Funding LLCs handling of my personal information and credit reporting. 

Timeline of Events and Actions Taken : Debt Validation Letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent LVNV Funding LLC a Debt Validation letter requesting validation of the alleged debt they are attempting to collect. This is my right under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). The letter explicitly requested that LVNV Funding LLC provide verification of the debt, including the original creditor, the amount, and other relevant details. 
No response was received from LVNV Funding LLC within the required 30-day period. This lack of response is a violation of my rights under the FDCPA, which mandates that they must provide this validation before continuing any collection activities. 
Cease and Desist Letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a Cease and Desist letter to LVNV Funding LLC, demanding that they immediately stop accessing or reporting my personal information to credit bureaus without my consent. 
This letter also reiterated my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), which requires consumer consent before any third party can access or report my credit information. I have not given LVNV Funding LLC permission to obtain or report my personal or credit information. 
Despite this request, no response has been received from LVNV Funding LLC, and they continue to report inaccurate and unauthorized information on my credit report. 

Key Issues : Unauthorized Access and Reporting : LVNV Funding LLC has been reporting on my credit report without my consent. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681b, they are not permitted to obtain my personal information or report it to credit bureaus without my explicit permission. Their actions are not only a violation of my privacy rights but may also constitute identity theft. 
Failure to Respond : Both my Debt Validation letter and my Cease and Desist letter were sent in good faith, requesting that LVNV Funding LLC provide the necessary documentation and cease their unauthorized actions. However, as of today, they have failed to respond to either request, which further compounds the violation of my rights. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution of this complaint and confirmation that LVNV Funding LLC is taking the appropriate corrective actions.

I must reiterate that I formally notified your office on [ Insert Date of Original Letter ] under 15 USC 1692C ( c ) that I refuse to pay the debt in question and that all forms of communication, including reporting this account to any consumer credit reporting agencies, must cease immediately. The only communication I permitted was written correspondence mailed to my address to confirm the deletion of this account from your records. 

Despite this, your letter suggests that you either did not receive my previous request or are willfully ignoring it. Additionally, your communication via phone and your suggestion to continue reaching you via telephone are direct violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which prohibits further contact after a valid cease-and-desist request has been made. 

Furthermore, while you claim to be working with the creditor, you have failed to provide the detailed information I requested to validate this debt under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I have yet to receive the following : Details of the Investigation : Evidence uncovered to confirm the accuracy and legality of reporting this account. 
Certified Documentation : Copies of certified documents used to validate the account. 
Communication Details : Complete documentation of all communication between your office and the creditor, including dates, participants, and nature of discussions.

Verification Costs : An itemized breakdown of the costs incurred in obtaining the required documentation for verification.

Employee Competency : Names, titles, and qualifications of employees involved in handling the investigation. 
Delinquency Information : Specific date the delinquency commenced and the expected date for cessation of reporting for this account. 
Your failure to provide this information constitutes a violation of my rights under the FDCPA and FCRA, and your ongoing communication disregards my clear refusal to pay the alleged debt. 

Additionally, you acknowledged that the account is currently under review due to identity theft documentation recently submitted. This further underscores the need for you to cease all reporting activity on this account immediately and to conduct a meaningful and thorough investigation as required by law. 

Formal Demands : Immediate Cease of All Communication and Reporting : You must immediately cease all communication regarding this matter, including reporting the account to consumer credit reporting agencies. 
Complete and Specific Verification : You must provide all the requested verification and investigation details outlined in my prior correspondence. 
Written Confirmation : I demand written confirmation of the permanent deletion of this account from all records, including credit reports. 
Failure to comply with these demands will result in formal complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and appropriate state authorities. I also reserve the right to pursue legal action for violations of my consumer rights under the FDCPA and FCRA. 

This matter must be resolved in full compliance with all applicable federal laws. I expect your response to this letter, along with all requested information, to be sent via written correspondence to my address no later than [ Insert Deadline, e.g., 15 business days from the date of this letter ].",,"CAINE & WEINER COMPANY, INC.",MD,21206,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11227433

Recently, I made payments for purchases using Klarna and subsequently received a refund. However, instead of the refund being returned to my original payment method ( my card ), it was deposited into my Klarna wallet/balance. 

I never enabled this option for refunds to go into my Klarna wallet. Despite reaching out to Klarna support multiple times and repeatedly requesting that the refund be sent to my original payment method, I was met with unhelpful responses. Their representative insisted that the feature must have been enabled on my account, even though I did not authorize or activate this option. 

I escalated the issue to speak with a supervisor several times, but Klarna failed to address my concern adequately. They continue to refuse to transfer my refund back to my card, which is the default expectation for refunds. Instead, they are keeping the funds locked in the Klarna wallet, forcing me to use it for future purchases, which I do not want. 

This experience has been frustrating and feels unfair. Klarnas inability to resolve this issue is unacceptable, and I believe they are not acting in good faith. 

I kindly request your assistance in ensuring Klarna refunds the amount to my original payment method as I initially requested.

2024-12-21,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"Our conventional mortgage loan was service transferred from XXXXXXXX XXXX to Mr. Cooper / Nationstar Mortgage with an effective transfer date of XX/XX/XXXX. We were set up with bi-weekly XXXX payments with XXXX and have been attempting to get set back up with bi-weekly XXXX payments with Mr. Cooper / Nationstar Mortgage. 

Our complaint isn't with the servicing transfer, it's with Mr. Cooper / Nationstar 's servicing operations... specifically payment process, escrow operations and customer contact ( phone and XXXX XXXX ). 

We submitted a bi-weekly XXXX  payment request form with Mr. Cooper / Nationstar, as soon as our loan was live, which was acknowledged by Mr. Cooper / Nationstar on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Our {$2700.00} XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment was received and applied by Mr. Cooper / Nationstar on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We remitted the XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$2700.00} which was received on XX/XX/XXXX and incorrectly applied as a principal only payment. We were told by the Mr. Cooper / Nationstar customer service rep prior to submitting the XX/XX/XXXX payment ( to get XXXX payment ahead to initiate the go forward bi-weekly XXXX payments ) that Mr. Cooper / Nationstar would recognize it as the XX/XX/XXXX payment since our bi-weekly autopay request was on file and not apply it as a principal only payment. 

We had to contact Mr. Cooper / Nationstar on XX/XX/XXXX to have the principal only payment reversed. At that time we noticed that our mortgage payment had increased to {$3000.00} on the Mr. Cooper / Nationstar website due to an Escrow shortage at the time of transfer. In reversing the {$2700.00} principal only payment, we requested that Mr. Cooper / Nationstar apply the {$2700.00} to our escrow account and run a new escrow analysis to recalculate our go forward payment amount. 

We contacted Mr. Cooper / Nationstar on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to inquire on the status or escrow shortage payment application and escrow analysis rerun, at which time still had not been rerun. During the last contact on XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to call Mr. Cooper / Nationstar 3 times and was disconnected all 3 times. I had to resort to using the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) who was antagonistic and took an hour+ longer to address my questions with the back and forth typing and wait times, than a phone call would have taken to resolve. 

We were attempting to have the bi-weekly XXXX autopay payments begin on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. 

During this time our account was flagged with a past due payment message indicating that late charges were being incurred, even though we are still inside the XXXX transfer grace period. We were even receiving late payment email and text communication pushes, after having communicated with Mr. Cooper / Nationstar at each contact that we were waiting for their system to reflect the correct payment application and amount due. 

At this time we still have not been able to make our XX/XX/XXXX payment as we are waiting for the Mr. Cooper / Nationstar servicing system to reflect the adjusted payment amount. We will need to wait for the XX/XX/XXXX payment to post correctly... then make the XX/XX/XXXX payment and verify that it has posted correctly as a payment and not a principal only payment, and then possibly make the XX/XX/XXXX payment and verify the posting ... before resubmitting the bi-weekly autopay request again to hopefully begin the correct drafting cycle in XX/XX/XXXX. 

We have also requested a copy of our life of loan servicing file and related communications through the XXXX XXXX agent. Not sure why the representative felt it was necessary to include my title, who I am employed by and the group I work in... ( Mr. Cooper / Nationstar agent response attached ) At this time we are very concerned with Mr. Cooper / Nationstar 's ability to receive and post payments correctly, in a timely manner, and in alignment with the customers wishes/ intentions without having to closely monitor and follow-up. We also have a concern with some of Mr. Cooper / Nationstar 's customer contact technologies, capacity and customer service representative responsiveness.",,Mr. Cooper Group Inc.,IA,500XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11244189

Despite fulfilling all the stated requirements, I have yet to receive the bonus within the promised timeframe. 

As part of your promotion, I was required to : XXXX. Open an account during the promotional period. 
XXXX. Make three consecutive payroll deposits, each totaling {$1000.00} or more, over three months.

I successfully completed these requirements by making qualifying payroll deposits in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. After not receiving the {$300.00} bonus within the promised timeframe, I contacted your customer support team via chat. Your representative confirmed that the three payroll deposits required for the bonus were indeed made. Despite this confirmation, I was informed that the bonus will not be paid out, which is entirely unjustified and contrary to the terms of your promotion.

The failure to honor this promotion reflects poorly on your institution and undermines the trust customers place in your credit union. This situation has caused me considerable frustration and inconvenience.

The resolution I seek is simple and fair : I request that the promised {$300.00} bonus be credited to my account immediately as per the terms of the promotion.

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will be left with no choice but to escalate my complaint further. This may include filing a formal complaint with relevant regulatory bodies and seeking additional remedies to address this issue.

Despite multiple attempts to retrieve my report through their online platform, I have been met with consistent errors stating that "" Your online credit report isnt available at this time, '' as shown in the attached screenshot. 

Key Issues : Inability to Access Credit Report : TransUnions system has consistently prevented me from accessing my credit report. This includes attempts to log out and try again, as their platform suggested.

No alternative method has been provided, and I have been unable to verify or review the information TransUnion is reporting about my credit history.

Lack of Transparency and Assistance : Despite their acknowledgment of this error on their platform, TransUnion has not provided adequate assistance or explanations to resolve this issue.

Violation of Consumer Rights : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to access my credit report to ensure its accuracy and dispute any errors. TransUnions failure to provide my credit report denies me this right and jeopardizes my ability to manage my financial well-being. 
Resolution Requested : Immediate Access to Credit Report : I request that TransUnion resolve the issue and provide immediate access to my credit report via their online platform or alternative methods ( e.g., by mail ).

Investigation into System Errors : TransUnion must investigate the cause of the persistent error and provide a detailed explanation of the steps they will take to prevent such issues from reoccurring.

Assistance in Resolving Disputes : If any inaccuracies are found in my credit report once accessed, I request that TransUnion assist in resolving these issues promptly in compliance with the FCRA.

Supporting Documentation : Attached is a screenshot of the error message displayed on TransUnions platform when attempting to access my credit report. 
Impact and Final Request : This issue has caused significant frustration and has prevented me from exercising my rights under the FCRA. I kindly request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring that TransUnion resolves this matter promptly and provides access to my credit report without further delay.

The merchant claimed in there statement response to Citibank that I did not request cancellation. I however requested cancellation on 4 separate occasions. Gym 's can be notorious for declining to process a customers cancellation request in an effort extend the recurring charges to the member. 

( A ) On XX/XX/XXXX I prepaid for four individual weeks total personal training sessions ( month of XXXX ). 

( B ) On XX/XX/XXXX, the gym opened. 

( C ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged {$130.00} for two personal training sessions to begin in the month of XXXX. This charge occurred after I requested cancellation in person at the gym facility, with a representative by the name of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This is more than 30 days advance of the month of XXXX, which is what the {$130.00} charge on XX/XX/XXXX was applicable for. 

First time I requested cancellation in person on XX/XX/XXXX. This request was not processed by XXXX XXXX due to employee error. 

Second time I requested cancellation on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Third time I requested cancellation on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Fourth time requested cancellation on XX/XX/XXXX, and it was only after this charge that the cancellation request was processed. This gym facility opened on XX/XX/XXXX and I do not believe the staff was adequately trained to handle my cancellation request hence the reason it took four separate attempts to cancel. 

The {$130.00} charge incurred on XX/XX/XXXX was for prepayment of personal training sessions on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I was charged the {$130.00} for personal training charges for services that were not rendered as my last session with my personal training was on XX/XX/XXXX and the statement from XXXX XXXX also indicates that my last personal training session was on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have provided supporting documentation to Citibank and my dispute status is still indicated in favor of the merchant ( XXXX XXXX ) who claim no notice of cancellation was received. I have no other credit disputes on my card with Citibank in the last XXXX years so it is not common for me to dispute a charge with a merchant. However, in this instance, the staff did not process my cancellation request and it took three additional requests before the merchant finally cancelled the recurring charges.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Personal information incorrect,"To Whom It May Concern, I am submitting this complaint regarding Experians failure to address and correct the inaccuracies on my credit report. I am requesting immediate action to resolve the discrepancies I have encountered. 

After reviewing my credit report, I discovered multiple inaccuracies related to my personal identifying information. Specifically, there are several variations of my name, address, and date of birth that are incorrect. As these inaccuracies can significantly impact my financial standing and creditworthiness, I requested that Experian correct these issues by removing the erroneous entries. 

On XX/XX/year>, I sent a request to Experian to address these inaccuracies. Despite my detailed and direct request, Experian has failed to take the necessary steps to resolve the matter. In response, I have only received automated messages that do not properly address the substance of my dispute. From my understanding, automated responses to disputes are prohibited under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). According to Section 1681i of the FCRA, credit reporting agencies must investigate disputes and provide a meaningful response within 30 days. However, Experian has failed to respond appropriately, and it is clear that my disputes have been auto-verified without an actual investigation into my concerns.

I have provided clear and sufficient information in my dispute letters, including multiple variations of my identification documents, my Social Security Number, and my date of birth, all of which were attached to each of my letters. I have made it impossible for Experian to claim that they are unable to verify my identity. The lack of a direct response to my specific concerns, and the continued request for the same personal information, shows a lack of proper attention to my dispute. 

These stall tactics are a violation of my rights as a consumer. Under the FCRA, I am entitled to accurate and up-to-date information being reported on my credit report. Experians failure to address these inaccuracies is impacting my financial standing and causing unnecessary delays and complications with my credit applications. This ongoing issue is in violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA, which ensures the accuracy and integrity of the information reported on my credit report. 

In addition, Experians failure to comply with XXXX XXXX standards, which are used for the accurate reporting of credit data, further contributes to the ongoing issue. The discrepancies on my credit report have caused significant harm to my ability to secure credit, as financial institutions have been unable to properly verify my identity. 

I request that the CFPB take appropriate action to ensure that Experian complies with the law and addresses these inaccuracies on my credit report. A proper resolution would be for Experian to remove all variations of the following personal identifying information that do not match the correct information below : Correct Information : Name : XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX, NC XXXX I expect Experian to promptly correct this issue and provide a meaningful response that addresses the discrepancies. If Experian continues to fail to comply with the law, I request that appropriate legal actions be taken to hold them accountable for their failure to maintain accurate credit reporting. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to a resolution and a response at your earliest convenience.

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Since XXXX, Experian has reported my credit card debt double from each credit card causing my score to drop significantly and I have suffered financial hardships, denied jobs, denied loans and high aprs as a results this entire time. 
For example, XXXX credit card forgave my entire Loan as income and sent me a w2 form which they also sent to the irs for the forgiveness. This was around XXXX when I asked Experian to remove it and I sent them the documentation. I disputed this with the several times and they failed as always to investigate it and remove it from my credit report. 
Furthermore, Experian keeps extending the removal date for the collection items that should have been removed by now. 
A most recent example, portfolio recovery and associates had XXXX different listings on my report that was expired. I asked them to remove them but they refused and instead updated the balance and added additional months to remain in my credit report. 
They are damaging my credit report in purpose and are dinging my XXXX XXXX by too many points for simple inquirys. 
My Fico credit score is current XXXX and the higher it gets, the more Experian lowers my credit signigficantly for small transactions. 
There is one specific item that I just disputed from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX that should have been removed in XXXX. Last month in XXXX when I disputed it, they never inveatigated it and changed the removal date to XX/XX/XXXX. Here it is XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed it again, and they again is refusing to remove it. 
Like many many other consumers, Experian is violating my consumer rights by reporting incorrect and false information on my credit report for the past 7 years that has caused me losses, grief, and hardship while no attorney that I have tried to see cared to help. Which is why I found you for I see that you all are supposed to make sure that companies like this are held accountable for their actions. 
I would actually like an apology from the company and compensation for all these years of losses due to their direct failure to do their jobs on purpose. I see that Experian has a reacord of doing this to many people and have gotten sued. Why are they still doing this?

Before accepting a new employment contract for a different income amount, I told XXXX about this to make sure there would be no issues as I could get a different contract, if needed. She assured me that she ran it by underwriting and there would be no issue. 
Through out this process XXXX has been extremely hard to get ahold of. She has only answer her phone two times out of the dozen plus times I have called.

Approximately two weeks before closing I am being told I am denied because of my income is not enough, strictly due to the employment contract that I just signed. No one ever notified me and XXXX has refused to respond to my calls or emails. Her supervisor is now attempting to convince me that I should apply for one of their other loan products with a substantially higher interest rate.

We recently sold our home which paid this mortgage off on XX/XX/XXXX. There is an escrow balance held by Bank of America in the amount of {$6100.00}. 

I have inquired to Bank of America Mortgage Services Customer Service on multiple accounts regarding the timely return and status updates of our escrow balance. I have called on the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I was initially told that the escrow amount would take 20 business days from the time the loan was paid off to be returned. This would have given Bank of America a deadline of XX/XX/XXXX to return the escrow amount. I was told that the amount was sent out on XX/XX/XXXX. It was sent via USPS with non-trackable postage. I have not received this check as of XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that if I has not received the check by XX/XX/XXXX, a new check could be resent. 

When I called on XX/XX/XXXX, my concern was being elevated to a supervisor with my request that the funds be electronically ACH transferred to my checking. I requested a call from the supervisor. 

I believe my concerns have not been addressed by Bank of America. All I would like is my escrow balance of {$6100.00} be returned to us. There should be no reason why a large banking institution such as Bank of America take 20 business days to return funds rightfully owed to us as customers. I am concerned that Bank of America intentionally holds onto these funds for their own benefit of collecting interest investment income on this money.

2024-12-21,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"in CFPB complaint # XXXX I reported that the aggregate student loan totals being reported by the NSLDS were incorrect due to the fact that capitalized interest was being added to the loan total balances. I should still be eligible to receive {$24000.00} in direct student loans to continue my education. I asked NSLDS to correct the issue. The response I received from NSLDS confirmed my complaint. The response from NSLDS is as follows : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- "" This is an interesting one, but I can assure you that our code is doing nothing incorrectly and capitalized interest is not being added to the aggregate for any consolidation loan. I attached my worksheet where I compared their loans with our aggregate limits and their aggregate totals ; everything is accurate. 

The issue is that NSLDS cant find a link between their consolidation loans and their consolidated loans ( PN status ). The respective dates are too far apart for us to calculate a link between the open consolidation loans the consolidated loans and we dont have any valid reported linkages in our system ( this would be a servicer issue to report status date correctly ). 

Because we cant find an association, we ignore the consolidated loans and take the OPB of the consolidation loan at face-value and reflect it in the recipients XXXX totals. That explains why theyre exceeding their XXXX Subsidized and Combined Limits, but for their Graduate totals, theres not much nuance. They have XXXX XXXX loans that have a Graduate academic level and were calculating each of their respective Aggregate OPB correctly and reflecting it in the Graduate Unsubsidized Total. 

Only two loans are being impacted by Capitalized Interest amounts, both are Direct Stafford Unsubsidized ( NOT Consolidation ) loans. And for their PLUS Additional Unsub loans, theyre all Graduate loans, and we only increase their limits when the recipient is a Dependent Undergraduate. So nothing impacted there. '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- LEGAL REPORT TO THE COURT I. Introduction Comes now the undersigned counsel, on behalf of the student borrower ( Plaintiff ), to address the improper accounting methods used by the loan servicer and/or relevant educational agency ( Defendant ( s ) ) in calculating the Plaintiffs student loan aggregate limits. Despite Plaintiff having remaining loan eligibility of approximately {$24000.00}, Defendant ( s ) have improperly reduced Plaintiffs eligibility by including capitalized interest in the loan principal for the purpose of aggregate loan limit calculations. This practice violates the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( HEA ), as amended, and its implementing regulations under Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( C.F.R. ), and deprives Plaintiff of financial aid to which they are legally entitled. 

II. Statement of Relevant Facts Plaintiff maintains multiple federal student loans, including Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, and certain Direct Consolidation Loans. 
According to Defendant ( s ) own admissions, only two of Plaintiffs Unsubsidized loans have capitalized interest. Nonetheless, the total capitalized interest is being counted toward Plaintiffs aggregate loan limits.

Defendant ( s ) also acknowledge the lack of proper linkages between the consolidation loans and the underlying loans, but they continue to overstate the outstanding principal balance ( OPB ) by including capitalized interest amounts in the aggregate calculation for new loan eligibility. As a direct result, Plaintiffs eligibility for an additional {$24000.00} in federal loans has been wrongfully denied. 

III. Applicable Law and Regulations Higher Education Act ( HEA ), 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.

Under the HEA, federal student loans are subject to specific statutory and regulatory frameworks that govern annual and aggregate borrowing limits.

Aggregate Loan Limits Under 34 C.F.R. 685.203 This regulation sets the maximum annual and aggregate loan amounts that a student may receive in Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Nowhere does it authorize the loan servicer to include unlawfully capitalized interest in the principal balance for the purpose of restricting further loan eligibility. 

Provisions on Capitalized Interest, 34 C.F.R. 685.202 ( b ) While the regulation permits the capitalization of interest under certain conditions ( e.g., during periods of deferment or forbearance if interest is not paid ), it does not allow such capitalized amounts to be deemed principal when determining a students eligibility under the aggregate limits. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXXXXXX ) stands for the principle that the Department of Education and its agents must adhere strictly to statutory and regulatory directives. A failure to comply with regulatory provisionssuch as improperly interpreting or expanding the scope of aggregate loan amountcan render the agencys action arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ( cited for persuasive value ) similarly underscores that loan servicers must follow the precise regulatory guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Education when assessing interest, principal, and overall borrower eligibility. 

IV. Legal Argument Violation of 34 C.F.R. 685.202 ( b ) and 685.203 The Defendant ( s ) accounting practices contravene the Department of Educations regulations by counting capitalized interest as part of the outstanding principal for purposes of assessing new loan eligibility. See 34 C.F.R. 685.202 ( b ) ( authorizing capitalization but not including such interest in statutory or regulatory eligibility calculations ). 

Under 34 C.F.R. 685.203, the aggregate loan limit calculation is intended to cap the total amount a student may borrow in principalnot artificially inflated balances caused by servicing errors or improper capitalization. The unauthorized inclusion of capitalized interest in the aggregate effectively denies XXXX the loan funds to which they are statutorily entitled. 

Violation of the Higher Education Act ( 20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq. ) The Defendant ( s ) practice is directly at odds with Congresss intent to ensure access to federal loans within prescribed statutory limits. By artificially reducing Plaintiffs borrowing capacity, Defendant ( s ) violate 20 U.S.C. 1078 and related provisions that aim to protect student borrowers from arbitrary or capricious denials of loan eligibility. 

Failure to Properly Link Consolidation Loans to Underlying Loans Defendant ( s ) admit to a deficiency in linking consolidation loans to their underlying loans, thereby forcing the system to treat the entire consolidation loans OPB, including capitalized interest, as an undergraduate balance. This administrative error breaches their regulatory duty to accurately represent the borrowers correct loan history. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

V. Conclusion and Prayer for Relief Wherefore, based on the foregoing, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court to : Declare that Defendant ( XXXX ) current practice of including improperly capitalized interest in the aggregate loan limit calculation violates 34 C.F.R. 685.202 ( b ) and 685.203, and is therefore illegal. 

Enjoin Defendant ( s ) from continuing these unlawful accounting practices and order them to recalculate Plaintiffs aggregate loan balances excluding any improperly capitalized interest that is not allowed by law. 

Restore Plaintiffs eligibility for the additional {$24000.00} in federal student loans, as guaranteed under the HEA and its implementing regulations.

Grant any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

After several complaints with the department of consumer affairs, several complaints filed with the Federal Trade Commission and just recently, a complaint with supporting documents sent to the state attorney generals offices for review and possible violation actions to be taken against Portfolio Recovery Associates for this same, ongoing dispute. Portfolio Recovery associates has been advised in XX/XX/XXXX with letters of cease and desist demands as to communication with me to stop and letters of debt verification documents, with specific information requested but Portfolio Recovery Associates have not provided, but instead sent a a few old monthly statement bills with another creditor that has already been settled with a customer assistance program. Recently in a complaint filed on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX Portfolio Recovery Associates responded with again, repetitive, inaccurate and misleading information along with a misleading description of understanding of stating We are committed to extending courtesy, dignity and respect to customers going through times of hardship. This descriptive response is misleading as to this alleged debt is somehow authentic and not addressing the dispute or the issue. In this complaint on XX/XX/XXXX and a response was made on XX/XX/XXXX, Portfolio Recovery Associates further stated communication with me would be temporary suspended regarding this alleged debt. On XX/XX/XXXX, the very next day, Portfolio Recovery Associates called my home phone XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   and then my cell phone XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This after just being advised to cease and desist AGAIN in this recent complaint filed on XX/XX/XXXX with Portfolio Recovery Associates responding on XX/XX/XXXX of a long, drawn out excuse filled with misleading information about this alleged debt is proof of ignorance of the law, violation of my rights that are none stop and are online with past violations and heavy fines placed on Portfolios Recovery Associates by the Federal Government department of consumer affairs in XXXX then recently in XXXX. Due to the recent again, ignoring my cease and desist demand and complaints with the department of consumer affairs, a pending complaint was again filed against Portfolio Recovery Associates on XX/XX/XXXX directly to portfolio recovery associates calling my home and cell after just being informed and responding by stating they would temporarily stop communication in there response. Now today, I received another form of communication letter from Portfolio recovery associates as to this alleged debt that has several complaints already have been filed and some with response back an two pending for violations after such complaints. This is just repetitive ongoing harassment and intimidation tactics by Portfolio Recovery Associates that does not respect my rights but also is more alarming is the disrespect for the Federal Fair Debt Collection Act that has been violated over and over by Portfolio Recovery Associates and by these repeated complaints is very much aware of this law concerning the rights of consumers and is also aware of there blatant violations of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Act. It should be also pointed out, Portfolio Recovery Associates has a history of violating this Federal Fair Credit collection Act, providing misleading affidavits in debt collection actions, misrepresented that they intended to prove the debt if customers contested them. Now today, receiving this letter, see attached, is another intimidation tactic and ongoing harassment from Portfolio recovery associates AGAIN as to this same ongoing alleged debt, now sending letters of misleading intent of apologizing for me experiencing difficult circumstances and are willing to extend this alleged account for permanent hardship and requesting personal information as seen on the attached pic of such information. Again, after many many complaints to this alleged debt, already sent legal letters of cease and desist along with requests for specific information for debt verification but not receiving such in an XX/XX/XXXX communication, sent certified mail with signature required and received that Portfolio Recovery Associates did receive, has continued to violate my rights and the Federal Fair Debt Collection Act over and over without being held accountable is outrageous, unethical and illegal. This complaint, along with all other discovery evidence documents are being forwarded to now, legal counsel Ive spoken with and Portfolio Recovery Associates will receive notification of very soon. Im now asking the department of consumer affairs to bring this ongoing, multiple complaints and ongoing harassment and intimidation tactics by a debt collection agency that comes under the department of consumer affairs department for protection of consumer rights to take some kind of action or forwarding this to the appropriate agency that can hold this company in violation of the law with possible financial fines or other legal action seemed appropriate to stop this",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,NJ,08094,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11239208

2024-12-21,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Apparently, XXXX XXXX XXXX opened a credit card account in my name without properly verifying the actual applicant. I don't recall how I actually became aware of the account a couple of years ago ( likely I saw a credit report ). I contacted XXXX when I became aware of the account and well after it was in default. XXXX confirmed over the phone that it did not have my correct contact information in its records until I reached out to them to let them know that I never opened any account with them. XXXX however refuses to correct its error that it should not have opened the account to begin with. I called XXXX several times and also wrote them a couple of letters explaining everything to them, but they refuse to change anything. XXXX has continued to damage my credit by reporting the account as mine, which became delinquent which they eventually wrote-off. 

XXXX was completely negligent in how it issued the credit card. If it had bothered to confirm an email address or confirm a phone number, it would have known it had incorrect information, or at least have some way to trace who really opened the account. How it is possible a card issuer would not bother to at least verify contact information for someone applying for credit? And why is such a high burden placed on an innocent party to correct a card issuer 's mistake? There don't seem to be any consequences to XXXX for its negligence or unwillingness to correct its mistake, but I suffer the consequences of destroyed credit. 

After trying to get XXXX to correct the error, I reached out the credit reporting services to see if they could correct the reporting. XXXX "" investigated '' and somehow "" verified as accurate '' the debt, but it would be impossible to confirm that it is my debt because it is not mine. ( My appeal was received the same letter in response. The "" Adverse '' information of the delinquency will remain on XXXX 's reporting until XX/XX/XXXX unless some action is taken. ) As part of the XXXX correspondence, I noticed another credit card account with Citicards XXXX that I had been completely unaware of. When I called Citicards, they were unable to find any record of any account in my name or with my SS #. When I asked how is possible then that a delinquent account from Citi would show up as "" Adverse Information '' on my credit report, the rep did not have an answer. The Citicard rep on the phone seemed like she would be taking action to correct the problem, but I don't know what is happening. ( I only discovered the Citicard account issue this week even though the account was opened in XXXX. My credit report shows the negative information will not be removed until XX/XX/XXXX unless something is done. ) In XX/XX/XXXX, I filed an Identity Theft statement with the FTC and sent it to XXXX and XXXX. I spoke with XXXX again by phone earlier this week, provided all the information again, but nothing has changed. The representative suggested I file a complaint with the CFPB, which is what I am doing now. 

I am guessing my name an SS # were part of a data leak ( likely through the Government Personnel Office who did a background check on me and whose data breach was massive is widely known ). Whatever the source, data leaks are extremely common and credit issuers should know this and take basic steps to confirm someone's identity before issuing credit ( the CFPB did more to confirm my contact information to use this website than the credit card issuers did for whoever opened these accounts in my name. ) In a more just world, the burden would not be placed on the victims to correct the problems that occur through credit card companies being negligent in their processes. In an even more just world there would be fines or class action suits for all the harm they cause by doing this. I am sure I am not the only one whose credit has been ruined by these bogus accounts. Despite my excellent record on my actual credit accounts, these relatively small fraud items are killers. I did not do anything wrong, but the burden is on me to keep calling giant and uncaring institutions, dealing with their automated replies, writing new letters in response, filing forms with the FTC and CFPB. How is this system fair?

I think this is the company who keeps calling and claiming they are a XXXX XXXX. I have asked them to stop calling me and to send correspondence. I really believe they are ones who keep calling me from different numbers. I have also disputed this on all my credit reports which are still open because they haven't responded. 

First, I do not know of this company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) do not owe them any money and I have never been served with any notice advising me I had a court date and possible judgement. I contacted the company on the phone and was told by the person they are a XXXX XXXX, and the service was done on XX/XX/XXXX, around XXXX. I live in a secure property and building which requires a key fob to enter and visitors MUST sign in with the leasing office. The leasing office opens at XXXX M-F and I was told no one signed in to visit my unit on that date. Since the office was not open, I was told if any visitor entered any of our secure buildings or property without permission and code from leasing office would be considered trespassing and the person would have had to illegally follow someone who had a key fob which would be considered breaking the law. There are posting all over the property advising visitors to sign in with the leasing office. 

Second, I was laid off from my XXXX in XXXX and currently unemployed and on employment insurance. I am also currently enrolled in school on a grant to finish my degree. 

The company who sent the garnishment letter is below ....

2024-12-21,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On XX/XX/year>, while making an ATM transaction at the Citibank branch, my banking card was stolen by someone who was already inside the branch when I arrived. There was no XXXX involved, the man, who was a XXXX male, offered unsolicited help with the ATM and proceeded to quickly remove my card from my hand ( which I snatched back as quickly as I could ) and switched it with another person 's card, which I didn't realize until hours later that same day, but not before the thief had stolen all the money in my checking account and made a {$70.00} purchase on my debit card at a nearby shoe store. To my surprise, he withdrew {$2500.00} at the Citibank teller 's window at the same branch where he had stolen my card, and then proceeded to walk to the Citibank ATMs inside the branch and withdrew another {$1400.00}. There were plenty of red flag signs that the teller should have picked up on. First, the amount was unusually high, in fact I think it is the highest withdrawal amount permitted in a day. Second, my account has a woman 's name on it ( as I am a woman ), and I do not have a Spanish name ( as I am not of XXXX or XXXX origin ), and the thief was a XXXX male. The tellers at that branch are all XXXX because there is a large Spanish-speaking community there and I imagine they are familiar with names that don't appear to fit the description of their customers. Third, when my account information was pulled up by the teller, that teller should have noticed that minutes earlier I had withdrawn {$60.00} from the ATM so to make a withdrawal of thousands of dollars at the teller window immediately after having already completed a transaction at the machine, is unusual. 

In any event, Citibank conducted 3 separate investigations, for the {$2500.00}, the {$1400.00}, and the {$70.00}. Citibank credited my account for the {$70.00} on the same day of the theft. They have not communicated any information to me regarding the results of their investigation of the {$2500.00} withdrawal that was done at the teller 's window. For the {$1400.00} ATM withdrawal, they posted the results of their investigation via a notification letter to my account. They did not call or email me to let me know about the letter or that their investigation was complete. I only discovered the letter when I happened to check my account to see if Citibank was still blocking the account. The letter stated that the thief used both my card and pin # to make the withdrawal and the withdrawal was consistent with my banking habits ( even though I have never withdrawn such a large amount at an ATM before ). The letter stopped short of explicitly concluding that Citibank was not accepting any responsibility for my loss but the tone and tenure of the letter certainly suggests that they are holding me financially responsible.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,10463,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11254197

This check is an advance on an accident claim in which i was struck by a vehicle on XX/XX/year>. 

this check is to help me aquire essential items like food, clothing and transportation whilst recovering, since it has been 3 months since the accident i have exhausted my funds whilst trying to cope with my recovery and inability to return home to earn a living. in dire need of funds i took this cash advance. 

i collected the check on monday XX/XX/XXXX and took it to chase bank with whom i started banking shortly before the accident asked the teller to deposit the check. she noted that the check would take 24hrs to clear as it came from another bank. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) i said it wasn't an issue since 24hrs wouldn't affect me. the following morning i sign into my bank account only to notice to my absolute horror, that the deposited now showed a message saying that JP MORGAN CHASE was going to hold my check until XX/XX/XXXX ... XXXX day. i immediately called the bank to find out what on earth was happening and why my check was being held. 

Upon calling chase the agent told me that the check was being help because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX '' wouldn't release the check. and any information to 3rd parties, this sounded ridiculous to me as it would mean that the countries largest banks do not have a secure method of communicating with each other. I asked the agent what she would need to release the hold on my check, she then transferred me to holding department. the agent i spoke to there said they needed the phone number of the business or owner of the business the issued the check. the issuing company is XXXX XXXX i have had no knowledge or dealings with this company before requesting this answer and all contracts and communication were taken care of by my lawyer. I explained this to the agent and requested them to hold whilst i reach out to my lawyer. My lawyer then provided me with the name and number of the gentleman who owns the business and i returned to call with the chase agent and provided the number. the agent seemingly input the number into a system and then proceed to tell me that the number wasn't in their system, now i have no way of knowing how they attempted to verify this number, or if they even did, i provided the information they requested and even called the owner of the business, at one point i conferences the call with him and the agent. to make a long story short chase continued to deflect the blame away from themselves holding my check onto XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX even though XXXX XXXX confirmed with me that not only had XXXX XXXX  XXXX, already taken the funds from his account, they also tried reaching out to chase on his behalf and chase refused to assist, claiming they couldn't confirm whether or not the person calling was indeed from XXXX XXXX XXXX 

i let chase know the purpose of the check and that i urgently needed the money providing them, with not only the contact information for the issuer but also for my lawyer with whom they could easily verify any information they needed about the situation. the check also clearly stated what it was for in the comment section with the words "" CASE LOAN ''. it is XX/XX/XXXX and i so do not have access to the funds that i desperately need. chase has never had any issues with me or my account in the few months i've been with them. all my deposits have been in person and in cash for with the few exceptions of XXXX transactions between my mother and younger brother for small amounts the largest being just over {$100.00}. usually going from me to one of them. 


water does stand out as suspicious is that my credit which i have with chase becomes due for payment on XX/XX/year> and is one of the reasons i got this advance. should i have gotten my funds on time i would have be able to clear out my credit card usage a little over {$700.00} at the time of deposit. chase would not get any interest on my card usage, however with my funds being held till XXXX day, chase has guaranteed themselves a fat interest on what is now my XXXX XXXXXXXX credit statement that has increased rapidly due to them holding my check forcing me to use my credit card for for transportation and food and other essentials that i would have otherwise been able to do with the funds from my deposits. their deliberate act of holding my funds without good reason other than "" they can '' allows them to take advantage of my upcoming card statement, to milk me with interest even though i should have funds in my account. even though it is them, JP MORGAN CHASE AND NOT XXXX XXXX XXXX THAT IS HOLDING MY CHECK. 

Not only that, there was a scheduled home equity payment with chase home finance that was made and then returned because the transaction put my account in a negative even though the deposit had already been made and was being held by chase themselves this subtle control of my funds to eek out a hefty interest from me simple because "" they can '' is nothing short of strong arming me knowing i'm in a desperate situation and can't do anything to fight the mighty J.p. morgan chase.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,11236,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11244730

I disputed kik off due to inaccurate reporting and information. Kik has done there investigation and verified it was accurate also use fcra laws in response when clearly violating mines more than one actually. Thats investigation is not true I pulled all three credit reports and they DO NOT report the same information on all three credit reporting agencies. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. Lets start with the double entries of charge off. It has come to my attention that the charge-off is being reported month after month on my payment history, which is incorrect. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), negative information such as a charge-off should only be reported once, corresponding to the date it was charged off.

The FCRA requires that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of the information they report ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Repeatedly reporting the charge-off each month results in a misleading and inaccurate credit report, which has significantly harmed my credit score.Additionally, the statute of limitations for reporting a charge-off is seven years from the date of the first delinquency that led to the charge-off ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) ). Continuously reporting this charge-off as a new event each month does not reset the statute of limitations and is improper. I have made them aware and they chose to keep it on my report. I pull up the information from Kirk on the app and it does not match what the response was in the letter let alone the utilization rate shows on the credit report. which is wrong and misleading. I was recently denied an treated unfairly due to what they were reporting. This accounts needs to be removed from all three credit reporting agencies as they are not reporting accurate or the same on either credit reporting agency credit report of mine. I am also requesting payment for damages under 15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance-If any credit reporting agency or furnisher willfully fails to comply with the terms of the FCRA, it is liable to the consumer for actual damages or statutory damages between {$100.00} and {$1000.00}, punitive damages, and the consumers reasonable attorneys fees and costs. Per FCRA 15 USC 1681 A ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) -Exclusions- transactions are not included on the credit report. LATE PAYMENTS ARE A FORM OF A TRANSACTION. With late payments reporting to the credit report this is a direct violation of the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT. THESE are actual fcra laws that kick off must abide by I requested it for it to be removed once and they didn't now im requested damages and removal from all three.

Chase still has not sent me my cashier 's check yet and hung up when I asked who I could complain to. Chase said that they had done "" research '' and claimed that the check was mine even though it wasn't. Chase failed to protect me as the consumer and then further victimized me. No secondary code appeared when the scammer logged into their mobile device stating that chase does not recognize that opp device is out of state. If chase can't keep their consumer accounts more secure, why are they punishing me? I would like a new profile and the ability to open a new account with Chase.

It was due to XXXX XXXX XXXX not giving me prior notice about a transfer and Peritus Portfolio Services for not given me proper notice of the transfer. I attempted to make a payment on XX/XX/year> on my auto loan through XXXX portal with XXXX XXXX but the portal wasnt working. I call the finance company XXXX XXXX and the number was out of service. I then call the dealership XXXX their number wasnt working. So i check my email and saw a message posted on XX/XX/year> bout my account is being transfer to Peritus and that the company had file for bankruptcy and had a number provided. I call the number provided to inquire about my account with them since the email stated i should had received a letter within 2 weeks of XX/XX/year> but didnt get any notice. So the guy ask me to verified some info once verified I ask him can he give me my account info and the link to make payment since I couldnt make a payment with XXXX XXXX payment portal. The guy told me he couldnt help me and that in fact i reach the wrong dept so he place me on hold to transfer me to customer service. After 10 mins he said nobody pick up so he was goin to place a note saying am looking for letter and payment info. After 2 weeks went by I call again to Peritus on XX/XX/year> to see what was goin on because i still didnt receive the letter or hear back and my account is now about to be 2 months late. Sound like the same guy answered the phone and it was the same scenio. I ask the guy can he give me the correct number so I wont be calling the wrong dept but i was rushed off the phone. So I was instructed to wait for the letter. And i never got that letter. So from that time after XXXX i been looking for legal help with my situation because I couldnt understand how the guy can veirfied my info but coudnt provide me with the account number, payment info or even tell me when the letter was exactly mail to me. I recheck my my email and I saw it was an letter attach to the XX/XX/year> email saying that XXXX XXXX XXXX was forwarding their number to Peritus number. That right there had red flag up for me because I look up was it legal for one business to merge their number to another business. And it stated it only legal if it within the same company and XXXX XXXX and Peritus is not the same company. So I did call back before the auction date of XX/XX/year> to make arrangement to pay the past due balance off but I never received info from Peritus about the transfer so I didnt feel comfortable sending my money to them. On XX/XX/year> I requested for the contract with Peritus and XXXX XXXX since Peritus mention the transfer was court ordered I requested for the info to for clarification, payment history from XXXX XXXX. And none of the requested documents was send to me. XXXX end up sending me a bill collector letter which is not the same as the transfer service of letter. And as of today my car havent been sold after it was stated that it was being auction off at a private sale on XX/XX/year>. I havent received any further correspondence from XXXX since XX/XX/year> of the bill collector letter. I believe both companies shown lender liability by breach of contract, wrongfully repo of my car, negligent, confusing communication, fiduciary relationship, and loan packing. I will attach 2 documents that was provided and please let me know if any of these documents are a valid and correct transfer of service letter. I would like to also add that request to opt out of SMS or text communication to XXXX XXXX XXXX so by Pertius saying I receive a text from the company will violate my rights of text communication because I ask them to stop communicating through text messages. Oh and I had find out that the car dealership and finance company are one company because they do in house finance.

Knowing the l would have a problem disputing the smaller and older transactions, I only disputed the 3 larger and more recent transactions. I contacted Cash App with proof that I was at work the time of the transaction ( s ) and would not have enough time to make to it my next shift in time for the other, proof of the multiple remote inquiries before the withdraws, and proof of the locations where the withdraws took place. In hopes these many photos and locations that were not usual spots of my transactions would help my case, I submitted my claim. I was approved on a single transaction, which was one half of a double withdraw transactions, and denied on the the other two. Clueless as to how I could be denied on one half of a double transaction at the same place, I resubmitted the transaction for dispute again along with the one at an unknown store and submitted additional proof. I was denied again and my account was closed. I lastly called Cash App support and tried to resubmit my claim by explaining to a representative how my Cash App card must have been duplicated by a skimmer and the whole situation. The rep put in the claim and also an appeal on the reopening of my account. Again I was denied and it has been 2 month with no response on my account appeal. Being an avid user with this experience, I fear Cash App are nothing but thieves working with criminals to help steal all our hard-earned money.",,"Block, Inc.",NY,11413,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11243637

- I successfully fulfilled this requirement by depositing the required amount within the specified timeframe. 

Despite meeting all the terms and confirming the promotions eligibility at the time of account opening, Truist Bank has refused to pay out the {$400.00} bonus. This refusal is both unjustified and a breach of your promotional terms and conditions. 

The only resolution I seek is straightforward : I request that Truist Bank honor its promotional commitment and deposit the {$400.00} bonus into my account promptly.

When I read online about PAYE being reopened for applications, I called them in XXXX. They had no idea what I was talking about. I went onto FederalStudentAid.gov and successfully applied for it. However, if Aidvantage processes the application, I expect an erroneous processing. 
2 - I am currently on the SAVE plan and am in forbearance with no interest accruing. I have continued to make payments as all payments are supposed to go to principal. The payment I made XX/XX/XXXX should have reduced my principal to {$48000.00}, but according to my account information, they applied only {$65.00} to my principal without any explanation. ( See the amount from FSA showing the amount outstanding as of XX/XX/XXXX before my {$230.00} payment was posted ). 
3 - I signed up for autopay through my account ending in XXXX with XXXX XXXX. All my payments were being withheld as proper. Then SAVE was put on hold. I continued to pay through this same account with no difficulty. Tonight when I signed onto Aidvantage, they had the last 4 of my account as XXXX but inexpicably showed my account as being with XXXX with whom I have never had an account. I am old - XXXX yo with almost a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. This so frightened me, I had to take extra XXXX XXXX XXXX. I printed that page so I have proof. I signed off and later signed back on and then it had XXXX. XXXX is now XXXX, but the routing number is the same. Why did this happen? 
4 - They show my student loans as being for having attended XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and those loans were paid off at least 50 years ago. The loans I made were for XXXX  XXXX University and XXXX University. 
5 - They can not provide me with a complete history of my outstanding loans. I think they have no idea what they are doing. 
I have zero faith in this servicer. I had XXXX before them and XXXX XXXX before XXXX. 

I think I am entitled to a professional, reliable and competent servicer who has and should provide me with a complete history of my loan history and payments. I think they should be compelled to credit my payments appropriately. I think they should know what changes are coming to the student loan program before I do ( having learned it myself from XXXX online ). I think they should correct all the errors in my record. 

Lacking that, I think I should be assigned a new servicer who can do these things. This is patently unfair to force me or any other borrower to have to rely on such sloppy record keeping when I and others are trying to make good on our payments Tonight, I filed a complaint against them on FederalStudentAid.gov, but see online posts that indicate FSA complaints go nowhere and suggest that your agency actually gets things done.

2024-12-21,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"Over the past year, I have been a victim of identity theft and fraud. I have had XXXX major credit cards affected as well as XXXX of my checking account. The complaint I would like to make is in regards to my American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
My credit limit with the credit card was {$8500.00}. There were fraudulent transactions occurring on my account for XXXX year with several recurring payments from September 2023-September 2024. American Express did not catch these fraudulent charges, and I unfortunately accrued a balance of close to {$6500.00}. Had Amex have had a better fraudulent detection on my account, I would have received the assistance to report them sooner. Nonetheless, XXXX XXXX  of this year I reported all of the fraudulent charges. Amex was able to remove all of the charges on my account, but in addition, they reduced my credit limit to {$1000.00}. This has affected my XXXX XXXX thoroughly, and I wish that they did not do this. I explained to them my thanks for removing the fraudulent charges and I disputed the credit limit decrease. They denied my credit limit dispute but could not seem to provide me with a good explanation to why. When talking with several customer service representatives about this, they just said it was due to the high number of transactions on my account and my XXXX score. I explained to them that the high number of transactions were due to the fraudulent transactions on my account and that I should not be penalized for this. In addition, my XXXX score was affected throughout the year the fraudulent charges occurred, by since XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX  I have since recovered my XXXX score from "" poor '' to "" good '' since the identity theft and fraudulent claims have been resolving. I explained that the decrease in my credit limit was also going to worsen the progress I have made. I kept being told by customer service to "" just wait 30 days and request a new credit limit increase '' but no one seemed to understand that I was unfairly penalized by having the credit limit lowered in the first place. 
It seems like Amex is not doing a consistent, thorough, and holistic review of this situation. 
It is also extremely strange that Amex decided to lower my credit limit AFTER I reported fraudulent transactions and not DURING the period the fraudulent transactions were being done on my account. This is likely because of the poor fraud detection.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,CA,958XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,In progress,Yes,,11229644

2024-12-21,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), I am writing to file a formal complaint against Huntington Bank regarding unauthorized transactions on my debit card, mishandling of my fraud claim, and severe negligence that has caused significant personal and financial distress. 

Incident Overview : On XX/XX/year>, my Huntington Bank debit card was used without my authorization. I had flown from XXXX, FL, to XXXX XXXX, MI, for a camping trip earlier that day. Upon returning and logging into my account, I discovered several unauthorized transactions totaling {$5700.00}. I immediately reported the fraudulent activity to Huntington Bank and locked my debit card. 

Fraud Details : Subsequently, I realized that my XXXX and XXXX XXXX accounts were hacked. The unauthorized party used my XXXX XXXX account to intercept two-factor authentication ( XXXX ) texts. Upon discovering this, I changed all relevant passwords and promptly informed Huntington Bank of the updated fraud details. 

Huntington Bank chose to refund only two transactions from a company named XXXX, which occurred around the same time as the other fraudulent transactions. This selective refund process raises serious concerns about how Huntington determines which transactions are fraudulent. Their approach appears arbitrary and deceptive, further highlighting the bank 's unprofessional handling of my case.

Huntington Bank 's Response : Despite my timely report and multiple appeals ( at least two or three ), Huntington
Bank repeatedly denied my fraud claim. I requested evidence supporting the bank 's determination that the transactions were authorized, but Huntington failed to provide adequate documentation.

Additionally, I requested a replacement debit card multiple times. A Huntington representative falsely claimed the card was shipped but returned. This was demonstrably untrue, as I received other correspondence from Huntington Bank at the same address, including a letter containing my ATM PIN.

Consequences of Huntington Banks Negligence : As a direct result of Huntington Banks mishandling of my fraud claim, I could not pay my rent and was evicted, leaving me homeless. This experience caused tremendous emotional distress and severe hardship. Huntington Banks lack of transparency, failure to deliver critical financial tools, and repeated denials have been both unjust and harmful.",,"HUNTINGTON NATIONAL BANK, THE",FL,32806,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11231755

However, your response does not fully address the issues I raised in my initial letter, specifically : 1. **Validation Timeline : ** While you have indicated that youve requested validation from the creditor, I request clarification on when you expect to receive and forward the requested documents. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) requires timely validation to ensure compliance with my consumer rights. 

2. **FDCPA Violations : ** My initial correspondence detailed potential violations of the FDCPA, including : - Adding unauthorized fees to the alleged debt.

- Attempting to collect a debt that I dispute or do not owe.

- Failing to provide the required validation notice within five days of your initial contact. 

Please provide a direct response to these specific concerns, including any steps you have taken to ensure compliance with the FDCPA.

3. **Cease Collection Activities : ** Until the debt is fully validated, I reiterate my demand that all collection activities cease, including further communications with me about this matter. 

4. **XXXX XXXX XXXX : ** I appreciate your confirmation that Transworld Systems has not reported this account to credit reporting agencies. Please confirm that no reporting will occur unless and until the debt is fully validated. 

5. **Next Steps : ** If validation is not provided within 30 days or if it is determined that the debt is not valid, I expect confirmation in writing that this account has been closed and that no further collection activities will take place. 

Please ensure all responses and documentation are sent to my address listed above. If this matter is not resolved satisfactorily, I am prepared to escalate the issue further by filing formal complaints with the FTC, and my state attorney general. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving a clear and comprehensive resolution.

Several weeks ago I met with XXXX and discussed making a new {$1.00} XXXX investment in his company. He told me his company was about to embark in a transaction and when it was complete, he could accept my new investment. Several days later I received an email from XXXX indicating that the event had occurred and they were ready to accept my new investment. On that day or the day after, all of my emails disappeared. Shortly thereafter, I received many emails, including the one I had lost from XXXX ( or at least I thought it was from XXXX ). The email was identical to the previous XXXX he had sent and included a separate XXXX document with wire transfer information. I communicated with XXXX via email ( again it was the fake XXXX who had hacked the real XXXX 's email ) and confirmed that I would be sending {$1.00} XXXX. He told me he would acknowledge receipt and shortly after I initiated the wire, he acknowledged receipt. To be clear, the email I was now communicating with was XXXX 's email except it had an "" XXXX '' at the end that I simply did not notice. My computer recognized him and his name popped up rather than the email address. I realized the fraud within XXXX hours and contacted XXXX to confirm that he had not actually received my money or communicated with me after his first email. Which he confirmed. The money went to a branch of Bank OZK in XXXX I spoke to my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as bank OZK and tried to get them to claw back the money immediately. Instead of the regular account for XXXX 's company which would be XXXX XXXX XXXX the account at the bank was in the name of XXXX XXXX. Again, I did not notice the insignificant discrepancy and thought it was intentional. In any event, I have yet to get any of my money back or receive any adequate cooperation from bank 0Z8. In my opinion, they should not have allowed the depositor ( who I am sure must have only recently opened the account and probably via remote access ) to receive and withdraw {$1.00} XXXX within a XXXX hour time frame with all the rampant fraud going on involving wire transfers.

I will be out of work and recovering for several weeks to come. Now, after XXXX yrs of having several accounts with Wells Fargo- my address was changed online in XXXX of XXXX and they claimed it was me. They closed my account on XX/XX/XXXX. They claim it was the XXXX XXXX due to address verification. The address that was put into the system was the physical address of my post office box - but in reverse. I did not do this and I have been using a XXXX XXXX XXXX numerous years now due to my ex-husband and his brother who works for Wells Fargo.

The branch XXXX XXXX XXXX told me the closing process on my account was already started and they would try to get me a check the next day ( Saturday XX/XX/XXXX ) and gave me an appointment at XXXX am. I had my realtor send a copy of my contract to purchase my house in XX/XX/XXXX to prove my address at their request and satisfied all address issues in question.

He told them I was a customer and in the building before they closed and needed to resolve the matter before I was sent away. XXXX XXXX and a man said if I refused to leave the police would be called to escort me out. There was no need for that at all because I was not rude or loud or anything. That is unprofessional and quite unacceptable to take all monies from my accounts and freeze them - leaving me with nothing especially during the XXXX XXXX. I reluctantly left and returned at my appointment time the next day and was directed to another man who said he would help as XXXX was busy. He then told me nothing could be done and I could not even get a check to open another account. He said I would have to wait to speak to the XXXX to find out when. He said he could print me previous statements and then printed statements for a joint account I had with my ex-husband that had been closed nearly a year ago. My husband was simply asking direct questions and requested that they fix this problem today and he snapped back that it was the XXXX XXXX, my husband and most of his family are veterans and this upset him. He told the man this and the man used the excuse that it was after XXXX yesterday and they couldnt fix anything because it was too late. My husband told him when it was XXXX in Kansas it was XXXX in California and that whoever they needed to call to resolve this should still be available because they wouldnt tell someone in California that it was too late. He replied XXXX its tomorrow in XXXX and that he was being snippy. I wasnt able to speak to the XXXX XXXX until after XXXX when she told me she couldnt do anything. The account was already closed and the process for the check had already been sent yesterday with my funds. She told me I would have to wait XXXX business days before I could come in and request to have another check issued if I didnt receive it. I asked for the stop payment on the check they had already sent and issue me another one and she replied they couldnt do that because I might receive and cash the other check. I told her that was not possible if the check was stopped and she told me that it hadnt been sent yet, the process takes time to be sent and then go through the mail. I asked again why they couldnt stop the process or even give me a loan for the amount in my accounts. She replied I would need an account in good standing for over a year to be eligible for a loan.

With this information it also states on my credit report that the loan was transferred. It does not indicate to whom the account was transferred to. Looking further into my credit report I see I now have a loan with Nelnet, in which they claimed to have acquired the loan via transfer from Great Lakes. When I look at my information on my FASFA account it shows that my loan with XXXX is at {$0.00} and that the loan was paid in full by consolidation. After speaking to a representative for the Dept. of Education I was informed that the loan showing in the system is not linked to any school. Yet the loan visible on my credit is to Nelnet. I have received a letter from the department of education dated XX/XX/XXXX that my loan is eligible for complete discharge but Nelnet will not delete the balance. Further more I have not signed any documents with Nelnet agreeing to consolidate any loans. But after further investigation it seems as though Great Lakes sold all signed documents/ accounts to Nelnet without informing borrower and then closed there business. Nelnet is now acting as Great Lakes because of a ( cash ) transaction conducted between both companies which allowed Nelnet to take on and take over accounts with borrowers unbeknownst them. What I don't understand and what concerns me is how business was conducted amongst said companies without the knowledge of borrowers and allowed to be legal and reported on the borrowers credit without the consent of the borrower?",,"Nelnet, Inc.",CA,91387,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11226621
