2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"XXXX XXXX XXXX used unfair collection practices to repossess my vehicle ; I have been long time member with XXXX XXXX made vehicle payments on time paid more than monthly amount for 3 years recently fell on hard times. Reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX to discuss hardship/ deferment payment options which they have a plan that I'm billed monthly at XXXX to protect auto loan in the event I am faced with a hardship I had to "" APPLY/QUALIFY '' for this assistance ; application were submitted for 3 months and were either ignored, marked as incomplete or denied. How do you get denied for hardship assistance when there's a reduction of income. All lenders offer the ability to place payments at the end of the loan without submitting proof of income/harship we have never used this benefit/program. It my belief we qualified due to national COVID disaster assistance programs, reduction of income due to being temporarily unemployed, and vehicle was in area of Hurricane XXXX of XXXX so we had 3 life changing events that XXXX advertise assistance for and we were repeatedly denied. Furthermore in State of Illinois lenders are required to send letter advising consumers of intent of repossession detailing redemption process ; and allow consumer 21 days to resolve issue before action is taken if loan is paid off more than 30 %. We never received written notification and loan is paid off 50 %. The original loan taken out XX/XX/XXXX was {$49000.00}. our current balance is XXXX which includes additional fees payments. Consumer rights were violated : 15 USC 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), 15 USC 1681i, 15 USC 1681s-2, UCC 9 PART 6, UCC 9-609 ( b ) Breach of Peace, Public Disturbance. I logged into XXXX website and submitted payment of {$1500.00} which would have bought account current covering payment 2 months of payments our regular monthly payment is {$740.00} on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX CST was advised by XXXX customer service representative the repossession order was sent out XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX CST which was after payment was submitted. Once XX/XX/XXXX when vehicle was repo 'd contact representative that advised to cancel payment from day before the amount due had changed ( fees added and needed to add XX/XX/XXXX payment which posted to account XX/XX/XXXX ) the new amount due is {$3600.00} which is outrageous. The total due of account was {$2200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX when payment for {$1500.00} was submitted. Its my assumption that XXXX XXXX XXXX practiced unlawful collection tactics to repo vehicle due to the fact we have a great interest rate of 4 % the vehicle is more than 50 % paid off and there would be equity in vehicle if resold making repossession of vehicle more profitable transaction to bank verses working it out with a longtime consumer ; there is no reason we should have been denied hardship repayment due to income that's the purpose of hardship income changes. We had to submit application and checks stubs to "" APPLY '' to use coverage program that I have been billed XXXX per month for last 3 years. Repossession was preformed without proper legal authority.

- Breach of Peace/Public Disturbance : The manner in which the repossession was handled caused a public disturbance and did not adhere to the legal requirement of maintaining the peace.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccurate information in my credit file. I am requesting that you conduct a thorough investigation of this matter to verify whether the creditor has reported this debt accurately and whether they have fulfilled their obligation to issue a 1099-C. If they are unable to provide proof of the cancellation of debt and the corresponding 1099-C, I request that you remove this entry from my credit report.

First, I would like to remind you that under the FDCPA, a creditor must provide proper notification before taking action such as repossession. I did not receive any written notice concerning a default or an impending repossession within the time frame required by law. Specifically, in Illinois where vehicle is registered lender is required to send written notice of default and repossession intent informing borrower of intent to recover vehicle provide instruction of remedy of default ; notice also allows borrower 21 days to bring loan current if vehicle is more than 30 % paid off.

Additionally, I would like to request that you provide me with documentation proving your right to repossess the vehicle, including the original loan agreement and any correspondence related to the default. According to the law, I have the right to receive this information, and failure to provide it may constitute additional violations of our rights as a consumer.

XXXX XXXX has inaccurately reported information about transactions and experiences, such as late payments and charge-off statuses, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) and 1681s-2 ( a ). It is illegal for a consumer reporting agency to report a consumer 's experiences and transactions, including payment history. These "" late payments '' must be removed, and this account must be updated immediately. Despite being notified of these inaccuracies, they continue to furnish misleading information to Experian, XXXX, and XXXX, which also violates 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( a ), as they failed to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the due date, improperly marking payments as late. I have not received the required notices or statements, which caused further harm to my credit profile.

Per 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( a ) Time to make payments : A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than twenty-one days before the payment due date. XXXX XXXX is in violation of this code. 
Violations of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Failure to Address Credit Balances ( 15 U.S.C. 1666d ) : When a credit balance exceeding {$1.00} arises from payments, rebates, or other transactions, the creditor must : ( A ) Credit the amount to the consumer 's account. ( B ) Refund any remaining balance upon the consumer 's request. ( C ) Make a good-faith effort to refund balances exceeding six months unless the consumer 's current location can not be determined. I formally requested documentary evidence under 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( b ) ( 2 ) and 44 to clarify disputed amounts and resolve the BILLING ERROR NOTICE sent to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX has failed to comply with these provisions, depriving me of the rightful return of funds. Failure to Provide Documentary Evidence ( 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( b ) ( 2 ) and 44 ) : Under these sections, I again formally request documentary evidence, including books of account, to clarify disputed amounts and resolve this billing error. Forfeiture of Collection Rights ( 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( e ) ) : Creditors who fail to address disputes and comply with billing error resolution requirements forfeit their rights to collect on disputed amounts. The creditors continued noncompliance means they have forfeited the right to collect on all past, present, and future amounts related to this account. 
XXXX XXXX, Experian, XXXX, and XXXX have also violated the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) by unlawfully sharing my personal financial information with non-affiliated third parties, including consumer reporting agencies, without authorization.

Violation of 16 CFR 433.1 and 433.2 Under the FTCs Holder Rule ( 16 CFR Part 433 ), creditors are not exempt from responsibility for compliance with consumer protections. Specifically, according to 16 CFR 433.3 ( a ), any seller who has taken or received an open-end consumer credit contract before XX/XX/XXXX, shall be exempt from certain requirements only if the contract does not cut off the consumer 's claims and defenses. Any attempts by this creditor to waive or limit my rights are invalid under these provisions. Despite this, XXXX XXXX has attempted to limit my rights by reporting false and inaccurate data. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair and deceptive practices, mandating that consumer credit reports be accurately maintained.

Under California Civil Code 1785.25 ( a ), furnishing inaccurate or incomplete information to consumer reporting agencies is prohibited. XXXX XXXX has knowingly submitted false data. California Civil Code 1785.31 allows consumers to seek damages for inaccuracies. Additionally, under the California Financial Code 4052-4053, financial institutions must disclose how personal financial information is shared or used, which XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX do. 
I formally exercise my right to opt out of any disclosures of my personal information under 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( GLBA ), 12 CFR 1016.7 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( ii ), and 16 CFR 313.7. FORM OF OPT OUT NOTICE TO CONSUMERS/OPT OUT METHODS- SECTION ( f ) A consumer may opt out at any time. I revoke all implied or expressed consent for the use or disclosure of my data. Additionally, under the Privacy Act of 1974, my Social Security number must not be disclosed to any third parties except federal agencies as required by law.

The penalties for these violations are substantial. Violations of GLBA result in civil penalties of up to {$100000.00} per violation, personal liability for officers and directors of up to {$10000.00} per violation, and possible imprisonment. TILA violations may incur damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation, class action damages up to {$500000.00} or 1 % of the creditors net worth, and legal fees. Under the FTC Act, deceptive practices can lead to significant fines and corrective measures.

Removal of erroneous hard Inquiries : Pursuant to 17 CFR 424, I hereby demand that XXXX, XXXX, and Experian remove all inquiries related to my personal information that are not linked to an active account from your records and any third-party reporting systems, including credit agencies, within XXXX business days. These inquiries include : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, MI XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, NC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TN XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  SD XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I formally request that XXXX XXXX and the consumer reporting agencies including XXXX, XXXX, and Experian immediately cease all unauthorized sharing of my personal information, correct all inaccuracies in my credit reports, and provide the accounting per the NOTICE OF BILLING ERROR. These entities must adhere to my opt-out rights under 15 U.S.C. 6802-6805, prohibiting further distribution or processing of my data without my explicit consent. Compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 is also required to prevent any unauthorized handling or dissemination of my personal information.

The unlawful practices described have caused significant financial harm, emotional distress, and reputational damage. The continued sharing of private information, inaccurate reporting of adverse items, and failure to address disputes have severely compromised my financial stability and undermined my rights as a federally protected consumer. 
I urge the CFPB to investigate these violations thoroughly and impose appropriate enforcement actions.

It was incorrect then and its incorrect now. I want this account REMOVED IMMEDIATELY before I am forced to seek legal counsel and request punitive and financial recovery for the damages that they have caused me over the years by providing misinformation to creditors. 

Credit bureaus have the obligation to report information correctly, they dont get to report the information incorrectly for years and then attempt to correct their mistake and report additional wrong information. THE ONLY resolve is to remove the account IMMEDIATELY! 

Once again using stall tactics they are blocking me from reporting online, now I must call in with a super lengthy wait time to dispute over the phone. This is just in hope that I will get tired of holding and get discouraged and hang up. They are charging my cc for online credit reporting services, they have sent me an additional authentication code to my cell phone to log in, so they know its me in the account.

These violations include inaccurate reporting of charge-offs, unauthorized inquiries, incorrect personal information ADDRESS NAMES, and errors that continue to harm my credit profile. Despite my efforts to resolve these matters directly, the violations remain unaddressed. I seek your intervention to enforce the law and hold the responsible parties accountable. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Re : Violations of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) I recently got a copy of my consumer file and noticed that there was inaccurate information.

You have 30 days to remove the personal information listed in this letter. I am also requesting you to provide me with the furnisher of this information or where you got this information from. Please PERMANENTLY REMOVE the following. 
This letter serves as a demand for immediate corrective actions, including the removal of inaccurate information from my credit report and the imposition of appropriate fines and penalties for your non-compliance.the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S. Code 1692. I demand immediate corrective actions, including the removal of inaccurate information, imposition of fines, and enforcement of compliance with relevant laws You are referring to a portion of 15 U.S. Code 1681c ( a ), which outlines restrictions on the inclusion of certain types of information in consumer reports. Here 's a rewritten version of the relevant clause with clarity on what consumer reporting agencies can not include : Consumer reporting agencies are prohibited from including in a consumer report any adverse items of information ( other than records of convictions of crimes ) that are older than 7 years. This includes adverse financial data such as : Accounts sent to collections. 
Charged-off accounts. 
Any other negative financial information. 
However, records of convictions of crimes are an exception to this rule and may be reported beyond the 7-year limitation.

This provision ensures that outdated and irrelevant negative information ( except criminal convictions ) does not unfairly impact a consumer 's creditworthiness or access to opportunities.

Here 's a clear summary : 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) - Duty of Furnishers to Provide Accurate Information 1. Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information : A furnisher ( such as a creditor or lender ) can not knowingly furnish information to a consumer reporting agency if : The information is inaccurate.

Would you like further details or help crafting a notice or dispute related to this? 
Under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), it is explicitly prohibited for any person to furnish information to a consumer reporting agency if : The information relates to a transaction or experience ( e.g., payment history ) that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe involves an illegal activity.

This includes any dealings or transactions, such as reporting payment history or account activities, that are associated with unlawful conduct. Reporting such information is considered a violation of federal law and undermines the integrity of consumer reporting. 
Let me know if you need help drafting this into a formal letter or document! 
Under 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( f ), the illegal reporting of inquiries refers to the prohibition of accessing or furnishing consumer reports for impermissible purposes. Here 's how this applies : Illegal Reporting of Inquiries : A consumer reporting agency or any person shall not obtain or use a consumer report unless : 1. The report is requested for a permissible purpose as outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( a ) ( e.g., credit applications, employment, insurance underwriting ). 
2. The requester has a legitimate business need for the information, authorized by the consumer or required by law.

If an inquiry appears on a consumer 's credit report without a valid permissible purpose or the consumer 's authorization, this constitutes illegal reporting of inquiries. Such unauthorized inquiries can harm a consumer 's credit score or appear as misuse of their personal information. 

Would you like help drafting a dispute letter to address unauthorized inquiries or further explanation of permissible purposes?

Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681b Permissible Purposes of Consumer Reports The credit reporting agencies have violated 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 604 ) ( a ) by furnishing my consumer report to third-party debt buyers who do not have a valid contract with me. I have not authorized these parties to access or report on my credit file, yet their erroneous entries, including charge-offs and other derogatory marks, continue to appear on my report. 
2. Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information Creditors and debt collectors, who have no valid contractual relationship with me, have continued to report charge-off accounts that have been sold to third parties. These furnishers are violating 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) by reporting inaccurate and outdated information, which misrepresents the status of the debts. Once an account has been sold, the original creditor no longer has the legal standing to report it as active.

Reporting Charge-Offs which is Income Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681c Creditors have unlawfully reported charge-off amounts as income, which is explicitly prohibited under 15 U.S. Code 1681c. This practice is not only misleading but also illegal, as it distorts the accuracy of my financial records. Such actions are further compounded by the failure to update the information to reflect that the debts have been sold, which results in a violation of 15 U.S. Code 1666.

No Valid Contract with Debt Buyers Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681b Under 15 U.S. Code 1681b, consumer reporting agencies and creditors may only report information backed by a valid contract with the consumer. Debt buyers reporting my accounts have no such legal standing, as I never entered into any agreement with these third-party collectors. Therefore, their continued reporting is a violation of the FCRA and a clear breach of federal law. 
5. Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Ensuring Accuracy in Reporting Credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum accuracy of the information they report under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ). However, the continued inclusion of inaccurate charge-off accounts, misreported debts, and outdated information on my credit report demonstrates their failure to comply with this legal obligation.

6. Adverse Information Reporting Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 5 ) The reporting of adverse information, including sold charge-offs, violates 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 5 ). Adverse information can not be reported without ensuring it reflects the accurate status of the account. The failure to update my report with correct information constitutes a blatant violation of the FCRA. 
7. Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1692b ( 5 ), 1692d ( 2 ), and 1692c ( a ) FDCPA Violations The debt collectors in question have also violated the Fair Debt Collection I 3. Sold Charge-Offs Reported by Original Creditors Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) Creditors are prohibited from reporting debts they no longer own under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ). However, several sold charge-off accounts are still being reported as though they are owned by the original creditor. This misrepresentation misleads credit reporting agencies and potential lenders, violating both the FCRA and my consumer rights. These accounts should be immediately removed, and the creditors should face fines for this violation.

I have no knowledge of this account and am not aware of any obligation to pay the debt you claim I owe. I believe this account is either a result of an error or fraud, and I respectfully request that you provide all documentation proving the legitimacy of this account. 

This account, which is currently affecting my credit, is causing significant harm to my financial standing and impeding my ability to thrive. The presence of this inaccurate information is creating unnecessary obstacles, preventing me from obtaining credit, securing housing, and pursuing opportunities that would allow me to move forward in life. 
In addition, I believe your actions are in violation of my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), specifically under the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( the right to dispute a debt ) and 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( the prohibition on certain communications with consumers ). You have failed to provide the required documentation in a timely and proper manner, and your communication practices have not adhered to the protections afforded to me under the law.

Given these violations, I am requesting the following : 1. A full investigation into the validity of the reported debt, including all relevant documentation.

2. The immediate removal of this account from my credit report, as it is incorrect and violates my rights under the FDCPA.

3. Compensation for the financial and emotional damages I have incurred as a result of the violation of my rights.

Please respond to this dispute in writing within 30 days of receipt of this letter, in accordance with the requirements of the FDCPA. Failure to do so will leave me with no choice but to pursue further legal action to protect my rights.

Specifically, I am addressing issues with a XXXX XXXX  account that is reporting in violation of credit reporting regulations. The following inaccuracies are causing significant harm to my credit score, and I am requesting immediate action to correct or remove these entries. 

XXXX. Re-aged Account The XXXX XXXX  account is being reported with a re-aged date, which is a violation of credit reporting standards. This account should reflect its original date of delinquency and not a re-aged or altered date. This deliberate misrepresentation is harmful to my credit profile, and I demand the immediate removal of the re-aged date. 

XXXX. Balance on Closed Account The XXXXXXXX XXXX  account is also showing a balance despite being closed. A closed account should not reflect any outstanding balance. This inaccurate information is misleading and must be corrected immediately by removing the balance reported on this account. 

XXXX. Account Showing as Over the Limit The same account is incorrectly reporting as over the credit limit, despite being closed. A closed account should not be subject to over-limit reporting, and this misrepresentation of the accounts status is not only misleading but also unlawful. 

These inaccuracies are in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates that all information reported to credit bureaus must be accurate and complete. The continued presence of these errors is damaging my credit score and may have broader implications on my financial well-being. 

I request that Experian immediately investigate and correct the reporting of this XXXXXXXX XXXX account. The re-aged date must be removed, the balance on the closed account must be eliminated, and the over-limit status must be corrected to accurately reflect the closed status of the account. If Experian is unable to correct these inaccuracies, I request that they be removed entirely from my credit report. 

Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint and confirm the actions taken to resolve these issues. I trust that the CFPB will assist in ensuring that my credit report accurately reflects my financial history and that these discrepancies are resolved promptly.

Despite my efforts over the past three years to provide evidence of identity theft, neither XXXX XXXX nor the credit bureaus ( Experian, XXXX, and XXXX ) have taken appropriate steps to resolve this matter. 

Here are the critical facts of this issue : 1. Identity Theft and Disputed Accounts : I was a victim of identity, a time during which two XXXX XXXX accounts in good standing were fraudulently used. 
I provided police reports and a Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report to XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus, documenting this crime and disputing the debts. 
Despite clear evidence that these debts were not mine, XXXX XXXX refused to acknowledge the theft or resolve the accounts appropriately. 
2. Lawsuit Filed and Dismissed : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  pursued legal action against me in 2024, despite the ongoing identity theft dispute and my inability to pay for debts that were not mine. 
On XX/XX/year>, the court dismissed the case for want of prosecution ( DWOP ), with no judgment entered against me. This dismissal further supports my position that this debt is invalid and should not have been pursued in the first place. 
3. Credit Reporting Negligence : Despite the dismissal and my repeated disputes, all three credit bureaus continue to report inaccurate and derogatory information related to these accounts and lawsuit. 
The excuse provided by Experianthat the lawsuit was filed and therefore can not be removedis baseless given that the case was dismissed, and the accounts were the result of identity theft. 
The continued failure to address this issue violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates accurate and fair credit reporting. 

This negligence has severely impacted my credit standing and financial stability for years. The prolonged failure to remove fraudulent accounts and the erroneous lawsuit from my credit file has caused undue hardship, limiting my ability to rebuild after the closure of my business.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,79905,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11315620

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I recently discovered several inaccuracies on my credit report that need immediate investigation and correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Specifically : Multiple accounts, including those with XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  XXXX, are inaccurately reporting late payments. Per 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I am disputing these inaccuracies and requesting the accounts be updated to reflect a status of paid as agreed/never late. 

The XXXX account is listed without proper validation. Under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ), I have the right to request verification of the debt. I am demanding documentation such as the original signed agreement and proof of authorization to collect. If this validation is not provided, this entry must be removed from my report. 

There are unauthorized hard inquiries from XXXX XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ), XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and XXXX XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Per 15 U.S.C. 1681n, these inquiries must be deleted unless evidence of my explicit consent is provided. 

My credit report includes an incorrect address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA, XXXX. This must be removed immediately under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, as it does not belong to me. 

These inaccuracies not only misrepresent my financial history but also violate my rights under federal law. Credit reporting agencies are required to conduct thorough investigations within 30 days under 15 U.S.C. 1681i. They are also liable for damages if they fail to comply, as outlined in 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 15 U.S.C. 1681o.

I am requesting a detailed explanation of the procedures used during the investigation, per 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ), along with a corrected copy of my credit report. If these issues are not resolved promptly, I am prepared to escalate the matter by filing complaints with the CFPB and FTC or pursuing legal remedies. 

My goal is to ensure my credit report accurately reflects my financial history, and I expect this matter to be addressed with the urgency and thoroughness it requires.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Experian regarding their handling of my dispute related to identity theft and a fraudulent account reported on my credit report. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I reported to Experian that an account from XXXX  XXXX XXXX was incorrectly listed under my name, and that this account was opened fraudulently without my authorization. The account was created under the status of an 'authorized user ' using my personal information, which I did not consent to. I specifically stated that I do not have any account with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and requested Experian to investigate this as a case of identity theft. 

However, Experian declined to dispute the account. I then submitted another dispute request on XX/XX/XXXX, followed by another request on XX/XX/XXXX. Each time, Experian denied my request to remove or dispute this false account. 

I have provided Experian with a police report verifying that I am a victim of identity theft and have repeatedly asked them to provide the full XXXX  XXXX XXXX account number listed on my credit report. Despite these requests, Experian has refused to provide the full account number, citing that they can not see the complete number on their end. I find this particularly troubling, as Experian has made the determination that this is my account without being able to access all relevant information. Furthermore, XXXX  XXXX XXXX has confirmed that there is no account associated with my personal information or Social Security number in their records. 

Additionally, I have verified that this fraudulent account does not appear on my credit reports from XXXX or XXXX, further indicating that this is an error or fraud that Experian is mishandling. 

Experian 's repeated denials of my dispute requests and their failure to provide full account details are causing me undue stress and harm, as this fraudulent account continues to appear on my credit report. I am concerned that Experian is not properly investigating this case or adhering to the procedures necessary to protect my rights as a consumer. 

I am requesting your assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that Experian properly disputes the fraudulent account, removes it from my credit report, and provides me with the information necessary to further address this issue with XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your support in resolving this issue.

Specifically : Multiple accounts inaccurately reflect late payments, which violates 15 U.S.C. 1666 and related regulations under 12 C.F.R. 1026.13. These entries are incorrectly reported as late, despite the fact that payments were made as agreed.

Several debts are being reported without proper validation, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g. I am requesting that debt collectors provide specific documentation, including contracts or agreements bearing my signature, to verify their claims. Without this validation, these debts must be removed as per federal requirements.

Numerous unauthorized hard inquiries are present on my credit report, which constitutes a breach under 15 U.S.C. 1681n for willful noncompliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). These inquiries were conducted without my consent and must be deleted immediately.

In essence, my rights under the FCRA and related statutes have been violated, and I am demanding that these inaccuracies be promptly investigated and corrected to prevent further harm to my credit profile and financial wellbeing.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,SC,293XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11317532

2024-12-29,Debt collection,I do not know,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the repeated failure of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to properly investigate and validate disputed information on my credit report, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), codified at 15 U.S.C. 1681. Despite my numerous disputes and lawful requests for validation and verification, the credit reporting agencies have failed to provide evidence substantiating their claims and continue to report inaccurate and unverified information.

To summarize : 1.Failure to Provide Proper Validation : I requested the following documents to validate the alleged debts : Validation of the debt ( including actual accounting ) ; Verification of the claim against me ( such as a sworn affidavit or a hand-signed invoice compliant with the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882 ) ; A true and certified copy of the original contract or agreement binding both parties ; A certified copy of the original note ( credit agreement ) under penalty of perjury, confirming it has not been sold ; Confirmation of the identity of the authorized representative who performed due diligence under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. 
These lawful requests were ignored or inadequately addressed. Instead, I received generic responses claiming the information was verified, without any substantive evidence to support these claims. 
2.Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable investigation when disputes are raised. Merely stating that the information was verified without providing evidence or details of the investigation constitutes a failure to meet this legal standard.

3.Reappearance of Removed Items : Items previously removed from my credit report have inexplicably reappeared, raising serious concerns about the integrity of the investigation process and adherence to proper procedures.

4.Failure to Respond in Good Faith : My repeated attempts to dispute these inaccuracies were met with dismissive responses warning me not to send further disputes. This is both inappropriate and contrary to consumer protection laws under the FCRA. 

Given the severity of these issues, I am requesting immediate action to : 1.Conduct a thorough, independent investigation into the practices of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in handling my disputes ; 2.Ensure compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i by requiring the credit reporting agencies to provide documented proof of their investigations and validations ; 3.Remove any and all unverifiable and inaccurate items from my credit reports ; 4.Impose penalties or corrective actions against the credit reporting agencies for non-compliance with FCRA standards.",,ENCORE CAPITAL GROUP INC.,GA,30327,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11310045

2024-12-29,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"Complainant Information Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Pennsylvania XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX Email Address : XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding a series of high-interest student loans that I, XXXX XXXX, obtained under circumstances that I believe were exploitative and highly detrimental to my financial and mental well-being. These loans, which originally amounted to {$210000.00}, have ballooned to a staggering {$280000.00} due to exorbitant interest rates. As a result, I am now facing severe financial hardship and emotional distress, which I believe were exacerbated by improper loan origination practices and predatory lending. 

Background : Loan Amounts : {$210000.00} Current Loan Balance : {$280000.00} Issues Leading to the Complaint : 1. Uncertainty During the Pandemic : During the COVID-19 pandemic, when many were in a state of uncertainty, I was led to believe that acquiring a loan through a certain financial institution would help alleviate my burden. I was not given a clear understanding of how these loans would affect my long-term financial health. 
2. Exploitation of Family Circumstances : The lender took advantage of my familys perceived ability to contribute to the loan, particularly my mothers financial situation, despite her limited ability to do so. This assumption about her contribution was misleading, creating a false sense of security about the loan repayment process.

3. Marital Instability : At the time, my co-signer was going through marital instability, which further complicated my ability to make informed decisions regarding the loans. The lender failed to offer any understanding or accommodations for these personal circumstances, and I was pressured into accepting terms that were not suitable for my financial situation.

4. Lack of Experience and Knowledge Regarding Student Loans : As a recent graduate with little to no experience managing large debts or understanding the full scope of loan terms, I was not adequately educated on the long-term impact of these high-interest loans. The lender did not provide sufficient guidance or support to ensure I understood the full risks involved in the loan terms. 
XXXX. Excessive Interest Rates : The loans I was offered carried interest rates that were excessively high, far above the federal loan rates or typical private loan terms for someone in my situation. These high rates have caused the original debt of {$210000.00} to balloon to {$280000.00}, regardless of making regular payments.

6. Limited Refinancing Options : Due to the size of the loans and the high-interest rates, refinancing options are slim to none. I have explored various refinancing opportunities, but my loans remain unmanageable. The lack of viable alternatives has left me in a situation where the debt continues to grow, further impeding my ability to repay. 

Impact : Financial Distress : The escalating loan balance has created significant financial strain, preventing me from achieving financial stability. My ability to save for the future, invest in my career, or even manage day-to-day expenses has been severely compromised. 
Emotional Distress : The constant pressure of an insurmountable debt, combined with the knowledge that I am paying excessively high interest rates, has caused significant emotional distress. I feel trapped and overwhelmed by the financial burden, which has adversely affected my mental health. 
Inability to Pay : Due to the ballooning loan balance and my financial instability, I am now in a position where I can not make the required payments, further exacerbating my situation. The loan terms and conditions have left me unable to meet my obligations, which is putting me at risk of default and damaging my credit.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,SLM CORPORATION,PA,19104,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11316553

2024-12-29,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"Complaint Summary : I am writing to report a series of issues I have experienced with KeyBank that have caused me significant frustration, confusion, and financial penalties. These issues stem from the banks failure to correctly process a credit card payment on my behalf, conflicting explanations provided by representatives, and a lack of timely follow-up to resolve the matter. 

Details of the Issue : 1. Initial Incident : XX/XX/2024 : I misplaced my credit card and promptly logged into my online banking to place a temporary lock on the account. I also reported the card as lost to KeyBank and requested a replacement. 
XX/XX/2024 : While attempting to pay my credit card balance, I noticed that the account associated with this card had disappeared from my online banking. To ensure I had sufficient funds available, I transferred {$4000.00} from another KeyBank savings account to my checking account, bringing the total to over {$8900.00}. I called KeyBank and explained the situation to a representative, who confirmed my checking account balance and assisted me by making a {$5000.00} payment to my credit card on my behalf, as I could not access the account myself. I received an email confirming that the payment was successfully completed. 

2. Payment Reversal : A few days later, I noticed that the {$5000.00} payment had been reversed. 
XX/XX/2024 : When I called KeyBank to inquire, a representative informed me that the reversal was due to "" insufficient funds. '' This explanation was incorrect since my checking account had more than enough funds to cover the payment. The representative claimed there was a glitch in the system and advised me to manually make the {$5000.00} payment myself now that the credit card account was visible again on my online banking. I complied and made the payment, and the representative assured me that there would be no penalties, impact on my credit, or other negative consequences as a result of this issue. 

3. Further Issues with My Credit Card : XX/XX/2024 : My replacement credit card arrived, and I activated it. 
XX/XX/2024 : Both transactions I attempted with the card were declined. I called KeyBank and was told the card had been temporarily blocked due to "" suspicious activity. '' I explained that the attempted transactions were mine, but I was transferred between multiple representatives. One representative told me I would need to visit a branch for further assistance, while another supervisor explained that the issue stemmed from the payment error on XX/XX/2024. 
The supervisor clarified that the payment made on XX/XX/2024 had been incorrectly applied to the wrong account, which caused the reversal and a late fee of {$76.00}. The earlier explanation of "" insufficient funds '' was inaccurate. The supervisor assured me that the interest charge would be waived, and I would receive a follow-up call on XX/XX/2024. 

4. Unresolved Follow-Up : XX/XX/2024 : I did not receive the promised follow-up call. When I called KeyBank later that night, I was informed that a follow-up call was scheduled for later in the week or the following week, contradicting the supervisor 's earlier assurance. I spoke with another representative and their supervisor, who promised a call on XX/XX/2024 or XX/XX/2024. 

Reasons for My Frustration : 1. Inconsistent Explanations : Between XX/XX/2024 and XX/XX/2024, I spoke with multiple representatives and supervisors, each providing different and conflicting explanations. It wasnt until XX/XX/2024 that a supervisor offered a clear explanation of the real issueKeyBanks error in processing my payment on XX/XX/2024. 

2. Wrongful Late Fee : The {$76.00} late fee was unfairly charged due to KeyBanks failure to correctly process the payment I requested on XX/XX/2024. Despite receiving a confirmation email for the payment, the error caused a reversal and penalty, which was not my fault. 

3. Lack of Transparency and Accountability : KeyBank representatives have been inconsistent, untruthful, and unhelpful. The repeated misinformation, lack of resolution, and delays in follow-up have caused me significant frustration, concern, and inconvenience. 


I appreciate your attention to this matter and hope the CFPB can help resolve this issue promptly. Thank you for your time and support.

I had been a customer in the past and was not impressed with them and closed the account. With the prospect of new management and a {$200.00} bonus ( terms attached ), I decided to give them another try. The deal was to have direct deposits of at least {$2000.00} made to the account within the first 60 days from opening. The deposits were to be made from a regular month income source like pension, employer, etc. I am a publisher, writer, and editor. I had one of my clients send my usual monthly earnings to this new account as the offer required. His payments came from his business account which I verified with PNC Bank. The payments were made by nbkc bank which denominated them as XXXX payments despite the fact that they were made from a business account to an employee. PNC Bank refused to honor the bonus insisting that XXXX payments did not count. I contend PNC requirements are contradictory. These payments were indeed money earned from an outside source, a sole proprietor, who paid from his bona fide business account as he does for all the people who work for him. This is the elevation of form over substance, and wrong. I should be awarded the {$200.00}. The money was due on XX/XX/year>. I contacted them on XX/XX/year>, and since then they have refused to pay the bonus telling me they are still "" thinking about it. '' Since the terms of the offer contradict themselves, that is, business payments can be denominated as XXXX at least at some banks and for some sole proprietors, this is a deceptive and abusive practice as noted in the CFPB circular at pages XXXX attached.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Credit Report Dispute Request for Investigation and Correction To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute several inaccuracies on my Experian credit report. I have reviewed my credit report as of [ Insert Date ], and I have identified the following errors that require immediate correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Below is a detailed explanation of the disputed accounts and the inaccuracies : XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( Account Ending in XXXX ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : The account shows a credit usage of 268 %, which is mathematically impossible given a {$300.00} credit limit. 
Requested Correction : Verify and update the balance and credit usage to reflect accurate and lawful reporting. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account Ending in XXXX  ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : This account appears to duplicate the above account from XX/XX/XXXX. Both accounts indicate charge-offs, but there is no clarification as to whether they represent the same debt. 
Requested Correction : Investigate and delete any duplicate reporting. If they are separate obligations, please provide detailed documentation to verify the legitimacy of both accounts. 

XXXX XXXX ( Account Ending in XXXX XXXX - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : The account shows a credit usage of 127 %, which exceeds the reported {$700.00} credit limit. Additionally, the last payment date and balance update timelines are inconsistent. 
Requested Correction : Verify and correct the credit usage and balance. Provide clarification on the reporting discrepancies for the timeline of updates. 

XXXX. XXXXXXXX XXXX  ( Account Ending in XXXX ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : This account shows a credit usage of 201 % with a {$600.00} limit and an outstanding balance of {$1200.00}. Additionally, the comment mentions first payment never received, but the report lacks detail on whether this is accurate. 
Requested Correction : Verify and update the reported credit usage and outstanding balance. Clarify and provide evidence to support the comment listed under this account. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Account Ending in XXXX ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : The report states : Collection account. {$1800.00} past due as of XX/XX/XXXX, but there is no indication whether the debt is with the original creditor or a third-party collector. 
The timeline for updates is inconsistent, with Status Updated in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, despite the account being opened less than a year before. 
The terms listed as 1 month do not align with the balance reported unless additional charges ( e.g., termination fees ) are properly documented. 
Requested Correction : Investigate the validity of this collection account, verify the timeline for updates, and ensure the balance reflects lawful reporting. Clarify whether the debt remains with XXXX or has been sold to a collection agency. 

6. General Reporting Errors Inaccurate Status Updates : Several accounts reflect conflicting last payment dates and status update dates ( e.g., balance updates for closed accounts ). 
Duplicate Reporting : The XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX accounts appear redundant. 
Requested Correction : Ensure that all statuses, dates, and balances are accurately reflected.

I have attached a copy of my credit report with the disputed accounts highlighted for your reference, along with a copy of my government-issued ID and proof of address to verify my identity.

Please conduct a thorough investigation into these issues and provide me with the results of your findings. If you determine that the disputed information is inaccurate, I request that you promptly update my credit report to reflect the corrections and notify any creditors that received the incorrect information.

In accordance with the FCRA, I expect a response within 30 days. You may contact me via mail at the address above or by phone at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX if you require additional information. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your timely resolution.

This reporting is misleading and inconsistent with the legal definition of a charged-off debt. Additionally, XXXX has refused to issue a Form 1099-C to document the cancellation of this debt, further complicating the situation. 

I filed a prior complaint ( XXXX ) with the CFPB about similar issues, but the investigation appears to have been incomplete. XXXX continues to report inaccurate information, despite my requests for correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Actions I have taken : Contacted XXXX directly to dispute the accounts inaccurate status, including their refusal to issue a Form 1099-C. 
Filed a previous complaint with the CFPB regarding this account. 
Actions taken by XXXX : Refused to issue a Form 1099-C while still reporting the debt as charged off. 
Continued to report an unpaid balance and delinquent status on my credit report. 
This inaccurate reporting has significantly harmed my credit and financial standing, and I believe it violates both FCRA accuracy standards and 26 U.S. Code 6050P, which governs the reporting of canceled debts.

These items appear to be unverifiable, inaccurate, and questionable. Your agency has failed to ensure the accuracy of the information as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports. This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report. 

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors. I have never entered into a valid contract with any of these entities, nor have I engaged in any transactions with them. As such, these accounts are fraudulent and and inaccurate information.

Moreover, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, my right to privacy has been violated, and this breach infringes upon my rights as outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974. Removing the inaccurate and fraudulent information from my credit report will help restore my privacy and prevent further violations.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11317900

I have requested validation of the debt, as required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), but I have not received any documentation or response from either XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or the credit reporting agency. 

Here are the details of the issue : Debt Collection on Credit Report : A collection account from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is listed on my credit report. This account is inaccurate or incomplete, and I have reasons to believe it may not be valid. 

Request for Debt Validation : On XX/XX/year>, I sent a formal request to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for validation of the debt under Section 809 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). This request required them to provide detailed documentation of the debt, including the original creditor, the amount owed, and proof that they have the legal right to collect the debt. 

Failure to Respond to Debt Validation Request : Despite the legal requirement for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide validation of the debt within 30 days, I have not received any response. This failure to validate the debt violates my rights as a consumer. 

Violation of Credit Reporting Requirements : Additionally, I have contacted the credit bureau that is reporting this collection account. The credit bureau is also in violation of my rights because, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), they are obligated to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information they report. Since XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has not validated the debt, the credit bureau is continuing to report this account without confirming its validity, which is a violation of my rights under the FCRA. 

As a result of these actions, I am requesting that the CFPB investigate the failure of both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the credit reporting agency to comply with consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA and FCRA. I am seeking the following actions : Immediate removal of the invalid collection account from my credit report. 
A written explanation from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding their failure to validate the debt.

The process wasn't straightforward ( had to log in, then unclear where to opt out ), and since I don't get much value from Experian and dislike their repeated emails and nag screen trying to upsell me whenever I log in, I decided simply to cancel my account with them. This revealed additional dark pattern practices. 

I saw no clear link for this. I engaged with their AI chat and it told me that to cancel I would have to phone them during working hours. 

I called them and got a very inflexible automated service which understood that I wanted to cancel, but it insisted that I explain why. I replied "" dark patterns '' twice and it claimed that it couldn't understand me and would not proceed with the cancellation. I gave a fuller explanation but it continued to ( it claimed ) be unable to understand my response. ( I had spoken very clearly. ) It ended the call and I never spoke to a live individual. 

For a credit reporting company ( one of an oligopoly of such services ) to be this impenetrable is clearly unacceptable and a disservice to citizens. Please require minimum criteria for ease of account cancellation AND data deletion.

XXXX. **Evidence of Fraudulent Activity** : If the dispute involves claims of fraudulent activity on my part or involving my account ( s ), kindly provide any supporting evidence that has led to these allegations, such as transaction history or relevant correspondence. 

XXXX. **Investigation and Resolution** : If the issue involves fraudulent activity that I did not authorize, I request that your office initiate a formal investigation to determine the source and nature of the alleged offense. In the event that this is the result of a fraudulent claim, I ask that appropriate measures be taken to clear up the matter. 

XXXX. XXXX*My Position** : I categorically deny any involvement in fraudulent activities and assert that I have neither knowingly nor intentionally participated in any actions that would violate 18 U.S.C. 1029. 

Please acknowledge receipt of this dispute letter and provide a timeline for when I can expect a response or resolution. I am confident that through proper investigation and review, this matter can be resolved swiftly.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Notice of Intent to Sue for Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally notify you of continued inaccuracies and discrepancies regarding the account [ Account Number : XXXX ] reported on my credit file. Despite prior disputes and reinvestigations, the following issues persist, in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., as well as other federal and state consumer protection laws.

Violations Identified : 1. Duplicate and Inconsistent Reporting : The account is reported with conflicting statuses, balances, and dates. The continued listing of a charged-off account with varying balances ( {$490.00} remaining balance, {$45000.00} written off ) is misleading and inaccurate.

2. Failure to Mark Account as Disputed : Despite my formal dispute dated [ Insert Date of Previous Dispute ], the account was not updated to reflect its disputed status as required under FCRA Section 611.

3. Incorrect Reporting Timeline : The account is scheduled to remain on record until XX/XX/XXXX. This exceeds the permissible seven-year reporting window if calculated from the first delinquency date. This misrepresentation negatively impacts my creditworthiness. 
XXXX. Payment History Discrepancies : Reporting charge-off status for months alongside ongoing balances without payments contradicts FCRAs requirement for accurate and complete reporting. 

Legal Basis for Complaint : Under the FCRA : Creditors and furnishers are required to ensure the maximum accuracy of information reported to consumer reporting agencies ( Section 607 ).

Consumers are entitled to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information, and the creditor/furnisher must reinvestigate and correct the errors ( Section 611 ).

My Demands : Immediate Correction : Update the reporting of this account to accurately reflect its true status, correcting all inconsistencies in balance, charge-off reporting, and payment history. 
Removal of Erroneous Information : Remove any incorrect data from my credit report, including improper balances and inaccurate reporting dates. 
Written Confirmation : Provide written confirmation within 15 days of receipt of this letter that the inaccuracies have been corrected or removed. 

Consequences of Non-Compliance : Should you fail to comply with the FCRA and resolve this matter immediately, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaints by filing formal disputes with the following agencies : The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) ; The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) ; and The [ Your State ] Attorney Generals Office. 

Additionally, I reserve the right to initiate a lawsuit against your organization for willful non-compliance, under FCRA Section 616, seeking damages, attorney fees, and any other remedies permitted by law.

Despite my repeated attempts to rectify the situation, each time the account comes back as verified and updated ; however, the information being reported does not align with the payment records I have obtained directly from XXXX XXXX. 

Specifically, I have documented evidence showing that I made payments on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. According to Experian I was marked as 60 days late for both of these payments. Furthermore, in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX is reporting that I am 90 days late ; however, the payment record for this period is missing. This inconsistency raises serious concerns about the accuracy of the information being reported to the credit bureaus. 

Additionally, I want to inform you that I disputed the same account with XXXX, and due to the inaccuracies in the payment history, they have deleted the account from my credit report. This further highlights the discrepancies between what Experian is reporting and the actual payment history. 

I believe it is crucial for consumers to have accurate and transparent information on their credit reports. I respectfully request your assistance in investigating this matter to ensure compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and to help rectify this situation. I also filed FTC report against Experian. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and support in resolving this issue.

They have lied repeatedly as to why they reversed the payment. 
The account had sufficient funds. XXXX violated its own internal controls reversing the payments. They told me customers not allowed to pay off loans online then hung up on me. Tonight they told me its my fault because I paid from a new account. That is a lie. I have had multiple accounts with XXXX for years. Now they are reporting the payments late for a car I have paid. They want me to pay hundreds of dollars more to fix their mistake. I want XXXX to reapply my payment, refund these bogus fees and train their people and clean up my credit removing this late payment.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I was listed in several major data breaches, compromising my personal information and making it susceptible to misuse. These breaches have resulted in the inclusion of numerous incorrect and unverified items on my credit reports, which vary inconsistently across the three major credit bureausXXXX, Experian, and XXXX. After obtaining my free credit reports, I discovered these discrepancies and initiated disputes with the companies reporting the negative items and the credit bureaus directly. 

Despite my efforts, the inaccuracies persist, causing significant harm to my credit standing and personal reputation. Despite my repeated efforts to correct multiple inaccuracies on my credit reports with all three credit bureaus, these errors remain unresolved. These inaccuracies negatively affect my creditworthiness and violate my rights under the FCRA. 

These breaches make any electronic records suspect, as digital signatures and documents could have been compromised or fraudulently created.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ), failure to provide this information invalidates the debt. Moreover, the inclusion of such unverifiable items on my credit reports violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, which mandates that credit reports be accurate and complete.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,75070,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11310673

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate and Misleading Reporting for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account To : Equifax and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Dear Equifax I am writing to dispute inaccuracies and violations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other applicable consumer protection laws regarding the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account appearing on my credit report. The misreporting of this account has directly impacted my ability to obtain credit and caused significant harm to my financial standing. 

Specifically, the following issues require immediate investigation and correction : Inaccurate Reporting of Charge-Off Status : The account is marked as CO ( charge-off ) for every month in XXXX. According to the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), furnishers of information are required to report accurate and complete information. Charge-offs are recorded as a single event, not repeatedly every month, as this creates a misleading impression of ongoing delinquency. 
Failure to Validate Debt : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ), I have the right to dispute the accuracy of information and request validation. I have not received proper validation or documentation of the alleged debt. If the creditor or furnisher can not verify the accuracy of this account, it must be removed from my credit report. 
Harm Caused by Outdated Information : Negative information, including charge-offs, can only remain on my credit report for seven years from the date of first delinquency per 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ). The reported delinquency first occurred in XX/XX/XXXX, yet it appears inaccurately and continues to affect my credit profile unfairly. 
Impact on My Ability to Obtain Credit : The inaccurate and misleading reporting of this account has resulted in denials for credit and higher interest rates, violating my right to a fair and accurate credit report under the FCRA. 
Requested Actions : I respectfully request the following actions : Immediate investigation of the inaccuracies under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ). 
Removal of repeated CO entries for XXXX and correction of any misleading payment history. 
Validation of the account details, including the original agreement, account ledger, and evidence of charge-off status. If this information can not be provided, the account must be deleted. 
Notification of corrections made to my credit report. 
Failure to address these inaccuracies and violations may result in further action, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and potentially seeking legal remedies under 15 U.S.C. 1681n for willful noncompliance. 

Please provide written confirmation of your findings and any actions taken within 30 days, as required by the FCRA.

These issues include : Inaccurate Late Payment Reports : Accounts like XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX are incorrectly reporting late payments. This violates provisions under 15 USC 1666 and 12 CFR 1026.13, which govern the correction of billing errors. I demand these entries be updated to reflect "" paid as agreed/never late. '' Unverified Debts : Multiple entries, such as those reported by XXXX, XXXX, and others, require validation under 15 USC 1692g. Ive requested documentation including signed contracts and proof of the debts legitimacy. Failure to provide this information violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and warrants immediate removal of the false entries. 

Deceptive Practices : Entities like XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX appear to be furnishing deceptive forms, as prohibited under 15 USC 1692j. This raises concerns about compliance with federal laws, and I insist these entries be deleted unless they can be substantiated. 

Unauthorized Hard Inquiries : Inquiries from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, and others are unauthorized and violate 15 USC 1681n ( A ), which outlines civil liability for willful noncompliance. These inquiries must be removed immediately. 

Incorrect Personal Information : My report lists incorrect addresses, such as XXXX XXXX XXXX, which I never resided at. This misinformation must be deleted promptly to ensure the accuracy of my personal data.

2024-12-29,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"First, my account has been improperly placed into a forbearance and/or deferment, when it should have been in the SAVE plan so that all months count toward my student loan forgiveness. I had originally been on the REPAYE and then switched to the SAVE repayment plan for the rest of my repayment period since it was first offered. When my loans were transferred to MOHELA, Mohela improperly removed my loans from SAVE and put them into a standard repayment plan - more than doubling my monthly payment amount. Prior to that, my loans were all on the SAVE plan. Accordingly, all of the loans should have been automatically moved onto the SAVE plan since they were originally on the REPAYE plan before. This was not done. Inexplicably, without my consent or request, MOHELA placed all of my loans onto the Standard/Level repayment plan. To fix these issues that MOHELA themselves caused, MOHELA placed me on administrative forbearance and/or deferment and told me to reapply for the SAVE plan that I had already been on prior to my loans being transferred to MOHELA. Their actions appear fraudulent. I never, ever asked to be placed on a standard or level repayment which is what MOHELA unilaterally did to my loans. MOHELA illegally capitalized my interest. MOHELA illegally charged me interest even after my account was placed onto the SAVE repayment plan. The SAVE plan is supposed to PREVENT the accrual of interest so long as all payments are made. As of the most recent injunction in XX/XX/year>, my monthly payment under the SAVE plan is supposed to be {$0.00} until the injunction is lifted. Instead of listing my payment as {$0.00} dollars, MOHELA still has my account listed as in forbearance and/or deferment, which is only after I was put on hold for 3 hours to argue a {$700.00} bill that MOHELA sent me in the mail. I need the account to be immediately placed into the SAVE plan. MOHELA coerced me into submitting a new IDR plan request under the false pretense that I needed to submit a new IDR application. In fact, there was no need to submit ANY new IDR applications. MOHELA was supposed to simply convert my REPAYE plan to the SAVE plan pursuant to the direction of the Biden administration. This was not done. Instead, MOHELA made me submit numerous applications each time I called in and then placed me on forbearance and deferment that set me back on my repayment schedule. Under the federal regulations, my IDR application, should have been the only IDR plan in effect on my account. As a result - All past due amounts ( and interest ) that has accrued on the account is the WRONG amount. MOHELA is willingly and openly committing fraud and taking advantage of financially vulnerable people. Action must be taken against the company as they are blatantly and knowingly defrauding Americans and misrepresenting the Department of Education and its values.

Debt Validation Issues : Regarding XXXX, I invoked my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) to request validation of the alleged debt, including original contracts and documentation proving the legitimacy of the claim. I emphasized that failure to provide such validation necessitates the deletion of the entry.

I cited relevant federal laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and case precedents such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Trans Union XXXX, to emphasize TransUnion 's legal obligation to conduct thorough and accurate investigations.

At first everything was great, but gradually nasty things emerged. 

Although I had set up online payments they weren't going through. I contacted the friendly bank official immediately. He had provided me with his direct line and email. He responded with a video link explaining "" how to set up online payments ''. I did watch, but honestly, this wasn't my first account or first time setting up auto payments, and not even my first BOA account. 

He even insisted I visit him in person so he could "" show me '' how to do it. I had no desire to interact with people who were clearly unwilling to accept responsibility. I would set up auto-pay. It would invariably go to - it is past due. I wasn't even getting alerts!! No alerts about payment dates which is another thing I got used to over the years. I wrote to them many times. 

They have done nothing to fix the flaw on their website/system. Also, sometimes the payment itself does not go through, and I have had to keep an eye to make sure it doesn't fail. 

It is almost as if they are very eager for my credit score to go down. They just sent me a letter informing me that they're reducing my credit line for "" not paying on time '' in part. 

This is just nasty. I don't deserve to be treated this way!!

They continuously do this even though I have a clear and consistent history of not only paying my bill on time, but have in fact overpaid on every monthly installment ( my previous payments this year alone have been $ 150 monthly -- this past month being the exception at {$100.00} -- with the minimum payment due being about $ 60 monthly ). I share this account as a joint account in name with my father, who I am not currently on speaking terms with. However, he does not use the account nor does he make payments. I called in XXXX this year to address the issue, to see if I could get my previous limit back or open another seperate account in my own name so this no longer occurs. They would not allow me to do either. As such, even though I have used this account and made proper, on time payments in good faith, Care Credit is not only damaging my credit with themselves by continuously and needlessly reducing my credit limit with them, they are artificially damaging my credit score by reducing what credit I have available to me, as well as damaging my credit utilization by reducing the limit down to dollars of what I currently owe ( In XXXX of XXXX, I had a credit limit of {$2000.00} and an available credit of {$570.00}.

On my credit report, I have good payment history, a very low percentage of late payments, and very few derogatory marks. I do not have poor credit to where I should be constantly having this issue.

On XX/XX/2024, I decided to cancel the reservation and contacted OneMain Financial to notify them that the XXXX provider would be refunding the amount to my account. OneMain Financial assured me that once the refund was processed, the overage amount would be mailed to me, and there would be no additional charges. 

Shortly after, I received an overage refund check for {$2000.00}. However, when I logged into my account to verify my balance, I noticed a charge of {$44.00} had been posted. I immediately contacted OneMain Financial to understand this charge, and I was informed that it was due to a "" cash advance '' taken on my account. 

This explanation did not make sense to me because I had not requested or authorized a cash advance. Upon reviewing the BrightWay app on my phone, it indicated that cash advances can only be performed at an ATM using a PIN and selecting the cash advance option, which I never did. I raised my concern with BrightWay, and an employee assured me the issue was corrected, and the charge was removed. 

To my surprise, on XX/XX/2024, the exact same {$44.00} charge reappeared on my account. This recurring charge is causing me great concern, as it could result in overdraft fees or late payments when my other scheduled payments are processed. 

Why I Believe This Is Unfair : I did not authorize or initiate a cash advance. 
Despite assurances from BrightWay that the issue was resolved, the charge reappeared. 
The repeated posting of this charge, coupled with the lack of clear communication and accountability from BrightWay, suggests possible mismanagement or unfair practices. 
This situation has caused unnecessary stress, and I feel as though BrightWay is taking advantage of me by imposing unauthorized charges on my account. 

Requested Resolution : I am requesting a thorough investigation into this matter and for the {$44.00} charge to be permanently removed from my account. Additionally, I ask that BrightWay ensure no future unauthorized charges occur and take measures to improve their customer service and billing practices. 

I have attached pictures from XXXX that document the dates and details of these transactions as evidence for your review.

2024-12-29,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Fees charged,"I am writing to follow up on a previous complaint I submitted against Selene concerning their illegal foreclosure actions on my mortgage. I have recently discovered a fee of {$1100.00} categorized under "" late fees '' and "" other charges '' on my mortgage statement. As my mortgage is a VA loan, it should not incur any late fees.

Despite my efforts to obtain an explanation and request the removal of these fees, I have not received a satisfactory response. I suspect these charges may be related to foreclosure legal fees, even though the foreclosure was initiated illegally due to the company 's failure to properly credit my mortgage payments. Since then, my home has been removed from foreclosure status.

Additionally, I have received letters from the company stating that my mortgage is in default due to these unexplained charges. Based on my previous experiences, I believe Selene. Finance iss engaging in predatory practices designed to delay responses and attempt to possess my home. 

I am requesting a thorough investigation into these charges. If they are indeed related to the prior illegal foreclosure, I demand that all fees be removed. Furthermore, I request confirmation that these fees have been eliminated from my account.",,Selene Holdings LLC,GA,30331,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11316632

After I told their agent that I am complaining to CFPB and that I have recorded their calls, they filed an internal complaint and now refuse to speak to me over the phone stating that their system is down ( I also recorded this as proof ) the problem : 1. As a consumer I have the right to information on my account such as my balance, recent transactions, payment history. 2. Capital one refuses to update my address and phone number stating that they need to verify my ID, and they are not willing to accept my United States Passport or my Passport Card. ( these are two valid forms of ID that I used to open my account ) I have no other ID, eve though I offered my birth certificate as well. 3. My personal data is being sent to an old address that is now someone else residence, this means that I don't have access to any communication including debt collection. I am concerned that someone else is getting my statements. 4. I am unable to update my phone number for the same reason, they state that I lack a state ID, however I simply do not have this, nor do I have the means to obtain. 5. I am unable to make purchases because I can not receive the security PIN, it keeps going to the old number. 6. The biggest problem is that I can not login online, nor can I update my address to get statements meaning that I have to call in to Capone to get status updates, verify transactions, and I'm concerned that the information may not be accurate or complete, and it is also very time consuming as to call in requires going through verification and hold times. 7. I believe that by law as a consumer I have the right to receive statements by mail to my designated address, on the last phone call I clearly provided this address to the agent and she acknowledged it but was not able to update. I believe Capone is out of compliance with at least one federal law, which is their duty to maintain updated customer information. Because I don't know how much I owe or payments, now the card is going into collections and this will impact my credit score. I Have attached the XXXX recording of phone call.

The emotional distress caused by this situation is profound, as the inaccurate reporting has obstructed my ability to achieve homeownership, a significant milestone in my life.

She stated over that I am liable for the charges. I called back later the same day. I spoke with a different rep and he stated the charges were reversed. I asked him to hold while I checked and to my surprise they were. I was told by the rep I would never see the charges again. On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my card again and the charges were back. I called again and got a fraud department supervisor. He just repeated over and over that capital one believes I made the charges. I explained I didnt and why would I go through this trouble if I have had XXXX problems paying for charges in the past. He just kept repeated my card was not compromised and I made the charges. The investigation was based on me still having the card in hand. Case closed. I would like more answers and an explanation if this is Capital ones best practices for any future instances.

XXXX XXXX own terms and conditions prohibit sharing such information with non-affiliates, yet they have disregarded this obligation. Per the Privacy Act of XXXX ( 5 U.S. Code 552 ( a ), I hereby revoke any and all authorizations given written, verbal, non-verbal that may have been previously provided to XXXX XXXX. Effective immediately, XXXX XXXX is prohibited from sharing, reporting, or distributing any of my personal or financial information to any third party, including consumer reporting agencies. 
Non-Compliance with Opt-Out Provisions under 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( XXXX XXXX ) : As a federally protected consumer under the XXXX XXXX ( 15 U.S.C. 6802 ), I hereby opt-out of any and all authorizations, written or verbal, that I may have provided to XXXX XXXX regarding the sharing of my personal information. XXXX XXXX has failed to honor its obligations under federal law by continuing to share my information without proper authorization, and I demand immediate compliance. 
XXXX XXXX has inaccurately reported information about transactions and experiences, such as late payments and charge-off statuses, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) and 1681s-2 ( a ). It is illegal for a consumer reporting agency to report a consumer 's experiences and transactions, including payment history. These "" late payments '' must be removed, and this account must be updated immediately. Despite being notified of these inaccuracies, they continue to furnish misleading information to XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX, which also violates 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( a ), as they failed to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the due date, improperly marking payments as late. I have not received the required notices or statements, which caused further harm to my credit profile.

Per 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( a ) Time to make payments : A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section XXXX ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than twenty-one days before the payment due date. XXXX XXXX is in violation of this code. 
Violations of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Failure to Address Credit Balances ( 15 U.S.C. 1666d ) : When a credit balance exceeding {$1.00} arises from payments, rebates, or other transactions, the creditor must : ( A ) Credit the amount to the consumer 's account. ( B ) Refund any remaining balance upon the consumer 's request. ( C ) Make a good-faith effort to refund balances exceeding six months unless the consumer 's current location can not be determined. I formally requested documentary evidence under 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( b ) ( 2 ) and 44 to clarify disputed amounts and resolve the BILLING ERROR NOTICE sent to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX has failed to comply with these provisions, depriving me of the rightful return of funds. Failure to Provide Documentary Evidence ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( b ) ( XXXX ) and XXXX ) : Under these sections, I again formally request documentary evidence, including books of account, to clarify disputed amounts and resolve this billing error. XXXX of XXXX Rights ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( XXXX ) ) : Creditors who fail to address disputes and comply with billing error resolution requirements forfeit their rights to collect on disputed amounts. The creditors continued noncompliance means they have forfeited the right to collect on all past, present, and future amounts related to this account. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX have also violated the Privacy Act of XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) by unlawfully sharing my personal financial information with non-affiliated third parties, including consumer reporting agencies, without authorization. 
Violation of XXXX CFR XXXX and XXXX Under the FTCs Holder Rule ( XXXX CFR Part XXXX ), creditors are not exempt from responsibility for compliance with consumer protections. Specifically, according to XXXX CFR XXXX ( a ), any seller who has taken or received an open-end consumer credit contract before XX/XX/XXXX, shall be exempt from certain requirements only if the contract does not cut off the consumer 's claims and defenses. Any attempts by this creditor to waive or limit my rights are invalid under these provisions. Despite this, XXXX XXXX has attempted to limit my rights by reporting false and inaccurate data. Section XXXX of the FTC XXXX prohibits unfair and deceptive practices, mandating that consumer credit reports be accurately maintained. 
Under California XXXX XXXX XXXX ( a ), furnishing inaccurate or incomplete information to consumer reporting agencies is prohibited. XXXX XXXX has knowingly submitted false data. California XXXX XXXX XXXX allows consumers to seek damages for inaccuracies. Additionally, under the California XXXX XXXX XXXX, financial institutions must disclose how personal financial information is shared or used, which XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX do. 
I formally exercise my right to opt out of any disclosures of my personal information under XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( GLBA ), XXXX XXXX XXXX ( a ) ( XXXX ) ( XXXX ), and XXXX CFR XXXX. FORM OF OPT OUT NOTICE TO CONSUMERS/OPT OUT METHODS- SECTION ( f ) A consumer XXXX opt out at any time. I revoke all implied or expressed consent for the use or disclosure of my data. Additionally, under the Privacy Act of XXXX, my Social Security number must not be disclosed to any third parties except federal agencies as required by law. 
The penalties for these violations are substantial. Violations of XXXX result in civil penalties of up to {$100000.00} per violation, personal liability for officers and directors of up to {$10000.00} per violation, and possible imprisonment. TILA violations XXXX incur damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation, class action damages up to {$500000.00} or 1 % of the creditors net worth, and legal fees. Under the FTC XXXX, deceptive practices can lead to significant fines and corrective measures. 
Removal of erroneous hard Inquiries : Pursuant to XXXX XXXX XXXX, I hereby demand that XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX remove all inquiries related to my personal information that are not linked to an active account from your records and any third-party reporting systems, including credit agencies, within 10 business days. These inquiries include : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  SD XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I formally request that XXXX XXXX and the consumer reporting agencies including XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX immediately cease all unauthorized sharing of my personal information, correct all inaccuracies in my credit reports, and provide the accounting per the NOTICE OF BILLING ERROR. These entities must adhere to my opt-out rights under 15 U.S.C. 6802-6805, prohibiting further distribution or processing of my data without my explicit consent. Compliance with the Privacy Act of XXXX is also required to prevent any unauthorized handling or dissemination of my personal information. 
The unlawful practices described have caused significant financial harm, emotional distress, and reputational damage. The continued sharing of private information, inaccurate reporting of adverse items, and failure to address disputes have severely compromised my financial stability and undermined my rights as a federally protected consumer. 
I urge the CFPB to investigate these violations thoroughly and impose appropriate enforcement actions. If these issues are not resolved promptly, I reserve the right to pursue additional legal remedies.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",CA,92691,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11312813

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Credit Report Dispute Request for Investigation and Correction To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute several inaccuracies on my XXXX credit report. I have reviewed my credit report as of [ Insert Date ], and I have identified the following errors that require immediate correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Below is a detailed explanation of the disputed accounts and the inaccuracies : XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  ( Account Ending in XXXX XXXX - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : The account shows a credit usage of 268 %, which is mathematically impossible given a {$300.00} credit limit. 
Requested Correction : Verify and update the balance and credit usage to reflect accurate and lawful reporting. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Ending in XXXX XXXX - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : This account appears to duplicate the above account from XX/XX/XXXX. Both accounts indicate charge-offs, but there is no clarification as to whether they represent the same debt. 
Requested Correction : Investigate and delete any duplicate reporting. If they are separate obligations, please provide detailed documentation to verify the legitimacy of both accounts. 

XXXX XXXX  ( Account Ending in XXXX ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : The account shows a credit usage of 127 %, which exceeds the reported {$700.00} credit limit. Additionally, the last payment date and balance update timelines are inconsistent. 
Requested Correction : Verify and correct the credit usage and balance. Provide clarification on the reporting discrepancies for the timeline of updates. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Account Ending in XXXX  ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : This account shows a credit usage of 201 % with a {$600.00} limit and an outstanding balance of {$1200.00}. Additionally, the comment mentions first payment never received, but the report lacks detail on whether this is accurate. 
Requested Correction : Verify and update the reported credit usage and outstanding balance. Clarify and provide evidence to support the comment listed under this account. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Account Ending in XXXX  ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : The report states : Collection account. {$1800.00} past due as of XX/XX/XXXX, but there is no indication whether the debt is with the original creditor or a third-party collector. 
The timeline for updates is inconsistent, with Status Updated in XX/XX/XXXX and Balance Updated in XX/XX/XXXX, despite the account being opened less than a year before. 
The terms listed as 1 month do not align with the balance reported unless additional charges ( e.g., termination fees ) are properly documented. 
Requested Correction : Investigate the validity of this collection account, verify the timeline for updates, and ensure the balance reflects lawful reporting. Clarify whether the debt remains with XXXX or has been sold to a collection agency. 

XXXX. General Reporting Errors Inaccurate Status Updates : Several accounts reflect conflicting last payment dates and status update dates ( e.g., balance updates for closed accounts ). 
Duplicate Reporting : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  accounts appear redundant. 
Requested Correction : Ensure that all statuses, dates, and balances are accurately reflected. 

I have attached a copy of my credit report with the disputed accounts highlighted for your reference, along with a copy of my government-issued ID and proof of address to verify my identity. 

Please conduct a thorough investigation into these issues and provide me with the results of your findings. If you determine that the disputed information is inaccurate, I request that you promptly update my credit report to reflect the corrections and notify any creditors that received the incorrect information. 

In accordance with the FCRA, I expect a response within 30 days. You may contact me via mail at the address above or by phone at ( XXXX ) XXXX if you require additional information. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your timely resolution.

'' Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( a ) ], credit reporting agencies are required to block negative information on a credit report resulting from human trafficking upon receipt of appropriate documentation. 

I provided the credit bureaus with all necessary documentation, including proof of my status as a trafficking victim, and requested that the negative items related to this situation be blocked from my credit report. Despite my submission, the credit bureaus negligently failed to comply with their legal obligation to block the disputed items. 

This failure to act has caused ongoing harm and is a direct violation of the FCRA. I am requesting that the CFPB take action to hold the credit bureaus accountable for this negligence and ensure they fulfill their legal duty to protect victims of human trafficking.

When speaking with the customer service representatives they request me to verify telephone number and email address in case the call is disconnected. Often time the call is disconnected on their end but they never call back. The customer service representatives often provide inaccurate information to me. They state that the situation will be escalated by the special handling department but no never follow up! 

This is civil liability for willful non compliance 15 USC 1681n. Please this a violation and I would like my payment per each violation. 

I have disputed XXXX XXXX XXXX with TransUnion for over XXXX months. I have disputed that XXXX XXXX who works with TransUnion deleted the XXXX XXXX XXXX Account from my credit report and uploaded supporting documentation to their TransUnion website but I was told today that they wont accept the documents with no clear explanation. I also disputed the inaccurate payment history. TransUnion has been reporting inaccurate information. Per TransUnion last payment date for XXXX XXXX XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX, but the payment history reflects payments in XX/XX/XXXX. This is a violation and this needs be permanently removed from my credit report. 

I also disputed XXXX XXXX XXXX with TransUnion. I disputed that they are reporting this as an open account when collection accounts are to be closed. Also I do not know who this collection agency is as I have never been in agreement with them. I ask that TransUnion please provide me with evidence stating that I signed any sort of agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Please delete from my credit report immediately. 

TransUnion also sent me a letter stating that they can not locate my credit report for the above disputes. So when I call TransUnion and speak with a customer service representative they have to look at the credit report to provide information over the phone. Once again this is a violation of my rights.

This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report.

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors. I have never entered into a valid contract with any of these entities, nor have I engaged in any transactions with them. As such, these accounts are fraudulent and and inaccurate information.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"XXXX XXXX XXXX used unfair collection practices to repossess my vehicle ; I have been long time member with XXXX XXXX made vehicle payments on time paid more than monthly amount for 3 years recently fell on hard times. Reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX to discuss hardship/ deferment payment options which they have a plan that I'm billed monthly at XXXX to protect auto loan in the event I am faced with a hardship I had to "" APPLY/QUALIFY '' for this assistance ; application were submitted for 3 months and were either ignored, marked as incomplete or denied. How do you get denied for hardship assistance when there's a reduction of income. All lenders offer the ability to place payments at the end of the loan without submitting proof of income/harship we have never used this benefit/program. It my belief we qualified due to national COVID disaster assistance programs, reduction of income due to being temporarily unemployed, and vehicle was in area of XXXX XXXX of XXXX so we had 3 life changing events that XXXX advertise assistance for and we were repeatedly denied. Furthermore in State of Illinois lenders are required to send letter advising consumers of intent of repossession detailing redemption process ; and allow consumer 21 days to resolve issue before action is taken if loan is paid off more than 30 %. We never received written notification and loan is paid off 50 %. The original loan taken out XX/XX/XXXX was {$49000.00}. our current balance is XXXX which includes additional fees payments. Consumer rights were violated : 15 USC 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), 15 USC 1681i, 15 USC 1681s-2, UCC 9 PART 6, UCC 9-609 ( b ) Breach of Peace, Public Disturbance. I logged into XXXX website and submitted payment of {$1500.00} which would have bought account current covering payment 2 months of payments our regular monthly payment is {$740.00} on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX CST was advised by XXXX customer service representative the repossession order was sent out XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX CST which was after payment was submitted. Once XX/XX/XXXX when vehicle was repo 'd contact representative that advised to cancel payment from day before the amount due had changed ( fees added and needed to add XX/XX/XXXX payment which posted to account XX/XX/XXXX ) the new amount due is {$3600.00} which is outrageous. The total due of account was {$2200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX when payment for {$1500.00} was submitted. Its my assumption that XXXX XXXX XXXX practiced unlawful collection tactics to repo vehicle due to the fact we have a great interest rate of 4 % the vehicle is more than 50 % paid off and there would be equity in vehicle if resold making repossession of vehicle more profitable transaction to bank verses working it out with a longtime consumer ; there is no reason we should have been denied hardship repayment due to income that's the purpose of hardship income changes. We had to submit application and checks stubs to "" APPLY '' to use coverage program that I have been billed XXXX per month for last 3 years. Repossession was preformed without proper legal authority. 

MAJOR CREDIT bureaus : I am writing to formally dispute numerous errors/ inaccurate information reflecting on my consumer credit profiles with all three major credit bureaus and to address several violations of consumer protection laws that have come to my attention.

- Failure to Provide Written Notice of Repossession Intent and Redemption Options : I did not receive the required written notice prior to the repossession of my vehicle, violating my rights under relevant laws.

- Failure to Provide 1099-C : I have not received a 1099-C for any canceled debts, which is necessary for accurate tax reporting.

- Breach of Peace/Public Disturbance : The manner in which the repossession was handled caused a public disturbance and did not adhere to the legal requirement of maintaining the peace.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccurate information in my credit file. I am requesting that you conduct a thorough investigation of this matter to verify whether the creditor has reported this debt accurately and whether they have fulfilled their obligation to issue a 1099-C. If they are unable to provide proof of the cancellation of debt and the corresponding 1099-C, I request that you remove this entry from my credit report.

First, I would like to remind you that under the FDCPA, a creditor must provide proper notification before taking action such as repossession. I did not receive any written notice concerning a default or an impending repossession within the time frame required by law. Specifically, in Illinois where vehicle is registered lender is required to send written notice of default and repossession intent informing borrower of intent to recover vehicle provide instruction of remedy of default ; notice also allows borrower 21 days to bring loan current if vehicle is more than 30 % paid off.

Additionally, I would like to request that you provide me with documentation proving your right to repossess the vehicle, including the original loan agreement and any correspondence related to the default. According to the law, I have the right to receive this information, and failure to provide it may constitute additional violations of our rights as a consumer.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to demand immediate action to address the inaccurate, damaging, and negligent reporting related to two XXXX XXXX accounts and a lawsuit filed against me that has since been dismissed for want of prosecution ( DWOP ). Despite my efforts over the past three years to provide evidence of identity theft, neither XXXX XXXX nor the credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion ) have taken appropriate steps to resolve this matter. 

Here are the critical facts of this issue : 1. Identity Theft and Disputed Accounts : I was a victim of identity, a time during which two XXXX XXXX accounts in good standing were fraudulently used. 
I provided police reports and a Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report to XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus, documenting this crime and disputing the debts. 
Despite clear evidence that these debts were not mine, XXXX XXXX refused to acknowledge the theft or resolve the accounts appropriately. 
2. Lawsuit Filed and Dismissed : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  pursued legal action against me in 2024, despite the ongoing identity theft dispute and my inability to pay for debts that were not mine. 
On XX/XX/year>, the court dismissed the case for want of prosecution ( DWOP ), with no judgment entered against me. This dismissal further supports my position that this debt is invalid and should not have been pursued in the first place. 
3. Credit Reporting Negligence : Despite the dismissal and my repeated disputes, all three credit bureaus continue to report inaccurate and derogatory information related to these accounts and lawsuit. 
The excuse provided by XXXXthat the lawsuit was filed and therefore can not be removedis baseless given that the case was dismissed, and the accounts were the result of identity theft. 
The continued failure to address this issue violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates accurate and fair credit reporting. 

This negligence has severely impacted my credit standing and financial stability for years. The prolonged failure to remove fraudulent accounts and the erroneous lawsuit from my credit file has caused undue hardship, limiting my ability to rebuild after the closure of my business.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,79905,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11313603

I have requested validation of the debt, as required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), but I have not received any documentation or response from either XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or the credit reporting agency. 

Here are the details of the issue : Debt Collection on Credit Report : A collection account from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is listed on my credit report. This account is inaccurate or incomplete, and I have reasons to believe it may not be valid. 

Request for Debt Validation : On XX/XX/24, I sent a formal request to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for validation of the debt under Section 809 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). This request required them to provide detailed documentation of the debt, including the original creditor, the amount owed, and proof that they have the legal right to collect the debt. 

Failure to Respond to Debt Validation Request : Despite the legal requirement for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide validation of the debt within 30 days, I have not received any response. This failure to validate the debt violates my rights as a consumer. 

Violation of Credit Reporting Requirements : Additionally, I have contacted the credit bureau that is reporting this collection account. The credit bureau is also in violation of my rights because, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), they are obligated to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information they report. Since XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has not validated the debt, the credit bureau is continuing to report this account without confirming its validity, which is a violation of my rights under the FCRA. 

As a result of these actions, I am requesting that the CFPB investigate the failure of both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the credit reporting agency to comply with consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA and FCRA. I am seeking the following actions : Immediate removal of the invalid collection account from my credit report. 
A written explanation from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding their failure to validate the debt.

If you dont initiate an investigation regarding my dispute, as it is my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I will have to take legal action to protect my credit rating and myself. Which Im sure you are aware each violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows damages of {$1000.00} should this matter ends up in court. 
I look forward to an expedite resolution of this matter Thank you.

2024-12-29,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",International money transfer,Confusing or missing disclosures,,"Having tried unsuccessfully to resolve my recent complaints with Bank of America ( BoA ), I now find it necessary to refer these complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to try to get more full and satisfactory answers and solutions from my bank. Please note I am an overseas customer of BoA, being a XXXX XXXX and now fully XXXX  and resident in the XXXX, after XXXX periods of living and working in the XXXX, prior to my retirement. 
The recent attempts by individuals from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( CCET ) of BoA to resolve or answer my queries and concerns have been vague and evasive and entirely unhelpful, to the point I am disgusted with the banks conduct. Despite my detailed emails to BoA on my complaints, I have received no formal response by email or other forms of written communication, setting out BoAs response or stance. I only get phone calls from them, during which they provide me with lots of platitudes and understanding of my reasons for complaining, but they do absolutely nothing to provide meaningful responses or any solutions to my complaints. While I never expected the staff at XXXX to have all the answers immediately available during the calls, I did expect they would make further enquiries with other staff in other departments who could provide proper answers but they repeatedly said they could not do this, nor would they explain why they couldnt make further enquiries, simply saying they couldnt do anything for me beyond their apologies and understanding. 
I attach hard copies of three relevant emails, dated XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX detailing the origins and progress with my complaints, before and after two calls I received from CCET. I have received nothing at all from BoA to attach, as they provided me only with two phone calls which proved useless in answering or resolving my complaints. I also now set out a summary of my individual complaints and what I would like BoA to do to resolve these for me. However, I stress that for the complete picture it is necessary to review in full the attached emails and other documents I provide. 
My initial XXXX complaints were listed and then detailed in my first email dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I can confirm that complaint number XXXX is now dropped as it was only ever a minor issue for me. I never got from XXXX a proper explanation of why my initial telephone complaint was never responded to, or even acknowledged, but I dont see much point in pursuing this further. It has affectively been overtaken by my later more formal complaints by email. I do, however, wish to pursue complaints XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, via this process with CFPB. 

Complaint XXXX - Increased credit card limit During my first call with CCET, the lady who called me was able to reduce the limit back to XXXX XXXX. She did this without having to send me any security PIN. The XXXX gentlemen who fielded my calls to BoA in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, failed to reduce the limit back to its original level because they were unable to send a PIN number to my XXXX mobile phones ( see also complaint XXXX below ). As the card limit is now back to where it was before BoA increased it without any reference to or agreement from me, all that remains on this complaint, is for BoA to reimburse me the cost of the calls I had to make to the bank from my home landline number in XXXX and XXXX. The cost of the calls is detailed in the hard copy emails attached, along with copies of my phone bills for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

Complaint XXXX BoA cant register XXXX XXXX phones for sending PINs Despite repeated requests, BoA have not provided me with an explanation on why they can not register XXXX XXXX  phone numbers for the purpose of securely sending PINs, when trying to do online banking with BoA from the XXXX. Without access to a XXXX cell phone, to facilitate wire transfers to my XXXX banks, I have had to purchase, at XXXX insistence, a XXXX XXXX XXXX at a cost of XXXX XXXX, which is about XXXX XXXX. I would like BoA to explain why they will not, or can not, use XXXX mobile phone numbers in the same way as they use XXXX cell phone numbers for issuing PINs. This practice is prejudicial against overseas customers. I also ask that BoA reimburse me the XXXX XXXX  cost of the security key. I dont need to use it for any XXXX banking, I only use it for BoA transactions. 

Complaint XXXX no response to telephone complaint made in XX/XX/XXXX As stated above, I am dropping this complaint, as it is now superfluous. 
Complaint XXXX Cancellation of a wire transfer without explanation During my calls with XXXX, they were unable to explain why this transfer was cancelled by BoA after it was shown online as successful. XXXX were also unwilling to enquire further with other departments in order to get an answer to this. The transfer was made to XXXX of my XXXX XXXX XXXX  accounts, which was listed online with BoA as one of my previous and therefore trusted recipient accounts. It defies any logic that the transfer was cancelled, causing further necessary phone calls by me from the XXXX to sort out. I would like an explanation from BoA why this was cancelled after it showed as successful when I was online. I also want BoA to reimburse the cost of my calls on this. 
Complaint XXXX inability to do wire transfers to the XXXX in XXXX  The full explanation on this complaint is shown over my XXXX attached emails of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. In response to my first XXXX emails, I took calls from different individuals from XXXX on XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, both providing no meaningful information to help me see and understand what specific sections and/or clauses of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX BoA from wire transferring XXXX  from my BoA savings account to XXXX of my XXXX bank accounts, both of which are previous recipients of my wire transfers. Neither of the individuals I spoke to were willing to enquire further with other BoA departments to find out this information for me. 
I find it astounding and completely unacceptable that BoA are hiding behind such broad legislation and are unwilling to be more specific on the actual date ( s ) and wording ( s ) of the relevant clauses of the legislation so that I may read and understand this for myself. BoA are using a very broad description of legislation, which was introduced from XXXX onwards, primarily to protect consumers financial interests, to prevent me doing what I want with my money. The Dodd Frank legislation runs to many thousands of pages, introduced and amended during three government administrations, over XXXX  years so far. Why cant BoA provide me with the details and wordings of the clauses which prevent them doing what I want to do? This lack of a full and proper response from BoA is not only unreasonable it is ridiculous. What are they trying to hide here? This is my money it does not belong to BoA. The actions of BoA are delaying me making wire transfers to the XXXX which would earn me better interest and also, potentially, better exchange rate and fee outcomes for me. The irony is that they are quoting consumer protection legislation to justify this restrictive practice! 
Also, the BoA verbal explanation to me that they can not do XXXX  transfers to the XXXX without being able to tell me the fees and charges of the XXXX bank do not square with the XXXX smaller ( test ) transfers I did in XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXX. BoA did the exchanges to XXXX  and the XXXX transfers included the same caveat that I may get less if the XXXX bank charged me fees. BoA need to explain this anomoly to me. 
BoA also refused to tell me which, if any, XXXX banks would let BoA know the charges beforehand to allow the transfer to go ahead in XXXX. 
I want a fully detailed description from BoA of the precise legislation titles, dates and wordings that prevent them doing transfers in XXXX  to my XXXX XXXX. I also want BoA to explain the obvious anomoly between their Dodd Frank legislation explanation and the fact they can do transfers in GBP without being able to tell me the XXXX bank 's fees. Finally, I want BoA to advise me which XXXX banks, if any, they can transfer to in XXXX  by getting the supposed necessary XXXX fee information.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",,XXXXX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11317595

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Subject : Dispute of Charge-Off Reporting for Debt # XXXX Dear Synchrony Bank, I am writing to formally dispute the reporting of a charge-off associated with the above-referenced debt on my credit report. Upon reviewing the debt history and publicly available records, it appears that Synchrony Bank securitized this debt under the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust ( XXXX : XXXX, located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  CT XXXX ). This transfer of ownership to the trust raises several concerns regarding the accuracy and legitimacy of the reported charge-off. 

Additionally, I have identified multiple data points associated with this debt that are being reported inaccurately across various credit bureaus. These inaccuracies further undermine the legitimacy of the charge-off and contribute to harm against me as a consumer.

Specifically, I am disputing the following : Accuracy of Charge-Off Reporting : If the debt was securitized and the receivables were transferred to the trust, Synchrony Bank may no longer hold the debt in its portfolio. Therefore, reporting a charge-off may not be accurate or compliant with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
Validation of Debt : I request detailed, debt-level documentation proving that Synchrony Bank retained the authority to report the charge-off after securitization. This should include a solid chain of authority demonstrating the assignment or reassignment of the debt back to Synchrony Bank, evidence of the debts transfer, the balance at the time of transfer, and any agreements validating Synchrony Bank 's continued reporting authority for this debt.

Potential Double Recovery : If the debt was sold or securitized, Synchrony Bank may have already been compensated for this debt through the securitization process. In such a case, reporting the debt as a charge-off could mislead credit reporting agencies and harm me as a consumer.

I request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and provide a written response within 30 days, as required under the FCRA. If you can not validate the legitimacy of this charge-off reporting, I demand that you remove this entry from my credit reports with all major credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) XXXX 

Failure to address this dispute accurately and promptly may result in additional action on my part, including but not limited to filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), or pursuing legal remedies.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Despite my numerous disputes and lawful requests for validation and verification, the credit reporting agencies have failed to provide evidence substantiating their claims and continue to report inaccurate and unverified information.

To summarize : 1.Failure to Provide Proper Validation : I requested the following documents to validate the alleged debts : Validation of the debt ( including actual accounting ) ; Verification of the claim against me ( such as a sworn affidavit or a hand-signed invoice compliant with the Bills of Exchange Act, XXXX ) ; A true and certified copy of the original contract or agreement binding both parties ; A certified copy of the original note ( credit agreement ) under penalty of perjury, confirming it has not been sold ; Confirmation of the identity of the authorized representative who performed due diligence under the Money Laundering Regulations XXXX. 
These lawful requests were ignored or inadequately addressed. Instead, I received generic responses claiming the information was verified, without any substantive evidence to support these claims. 
2.Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable investigation when disputes are raised. Merely stating that the information was verified without providing evidence or details of the investigation constitutes a failure to meet this legal standard.

3.Reappearance of Removed Items : Items previously removed from my credit report have inexplicably reappeared, raising serious concerns about the integrity of the investigation process and adherence to proper procedures.

4.Failure to Respond in Good Faith : My repeated attempts to dispute these inaccuracies were met with dismissive responses warning me not to send further disputes. This is both inappropriate and contrary to consumer protection laws under the FCRA. 

Given the severity of these issues, I am requesting immediate action to : 1.Conduct a thorough, independent investigation into the practices of XXXX, Experian, and XXXX in handling my disputes ; 2.Ensure compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i by requiring the credit reporting agencies to provide documented proof of their investigations and validations ; 3.Remove any and all unverifiable and inaccurate items from my credit reports ; 4.Impose penalties or corrective actions against the credit reporting agencies for non-compliance with FCRA standards.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,30327,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11310461

Merrill withheld my money for at least a week until I contacted the bank 's top director. After receiving the check, I asked the bank 's senior management several times via email. ( 1 ) Is it legal for you to withhold customers ' money for an "" investigation '' without any evidence after I closed my CD account? ( 2 ) Why did you use my money regardless of whether it was dirty money or not, and then withheld my money for investigation after I closed my CD account? I never got a reasonable answer.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I reported to XXXX that an account from Bank of America was incorrectly listed under my name, and that this account was opened fraudulently without my authorization. The account was created under the status of an 'authorized user ' using my personal information, which I did not consent to. I specifically stated that I do not have any account with Bank of America and requested XXXX to investigate this as a case of identity theft. 

However, XXXX declined to dispute the account. I then submitted another dispute request on XX/XX/XXXX, followed by another request on XX/XX/XXXX. Each time, XXXX denied my request to remove or dispute this false account. 

I have provided XXXX with a police report verifying that I am a victim of identity theft and have repeatedly asked them to provide the full Bank of America account number listed on my credit report. Despite these requests, XXXX has refused to provide the full account number, citing that they can not see the complete number on their end. I find this particularly troubling, as XXXX has made the determination that this is my account without being able to access all relevant information. Furthermore, Bank of America has confirmed that there is no account associated with my personal information or Social Security number in their records. 

Additionally, I have verified that this fraudulent account does not appear on my credit reports from XXXX or XXXX, further indicating that this is an error or fraud that XXXX is mishandling. 

XXXX 's repeated denials of my dispute requests and their failure to provide full account details are causing me undue stress and harm, as this fraudulent account continues to appear on my credit report. I am concerned that XXXX is not properly investigating this case or adhering to the procedures necessary to protect my rights as a consumer. 

I am requesting your assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that XXXX properly disputes the fraudulent account, removes it from my credit report, and provides me with the information necessary to further address this issue with Bank of America. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your support in resolving this issue.

The check was made out to the United States Treasury in the amount of {$XXXX}. The check as cashed for that amount on XX/XX/2024, and I assumed that everything was fine. I was first notified by the IRS that I still owed them the money on XX/XX/2024 by mail. I immediately contacted PNC bank and requested an image of the cashed check and received that 48 hours later. Upon opening the image I saw that the check had been altered and cashed by a XXXX  XXXX XXXX for the same amount I had made the check out to the IRS for. The check was not endorsed by anyone, and no personal identifying information is on the back of the check. This represents non-compliant bank procedures and the bank made critical errors that led to my funds not being protected as they are legally obligated to do as a regulated entity. I immediately contacted PNC Bank and reported the fraud and theft. They mailed me an affidavit, which I completed and had notarized and reported to them on XX/XX/2024 ( Reference # XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). They received it on XX/XX/2024. On XX/XX/2024 they contacted me and informed me that my case had been denied and that the case was considered closed on their end, due to that fact that it was not reported within 30 days of the theft occurring, which they are claiming is their policy. 

I am specifically documenting when the IRS notification was received, as this represents the first reasonable opportunity I had to discover the fraud. This is important because under UCC 4-406 ( f ), the one-year period begins when the fraud was reasonably discoverable, not necessarily when it occurred.

Under UCC 4-406 ( e ), a bank 's failure to exercise ordinary care in paying an item shifts liability away from the customer. In this case, multiple required security measures for a high-value item appear to have been bypassed : 1. The check was processed without a valid endorsement XXXX. The {$23000.00} amount should have triggered enhanced security review under XXXX requirements XXXX. Electronic deposit of an altered check of this size should have required manual review and verification XXXX. No verification of deposit authority appears to have been performed '' Furthermore, as this check was stolen from the mail, I had no reasonable opportunity to detect this fraud before it occurred. Under UCC Article 4, time limitations for fraud reporting do not apply when : - The customer could not reasonably have detected the fraud - The bank failed to exercise ordinary care - Required security protocols were not followed '' I will be filing formal complaints with the police, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX  I appreciate any assistance you are able to provide here.

I have obtained two different credit reports from Equifax, and they show inconsistent and misleading information for the same account, violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Summary of the Issue : Account in Question XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX NA Discrepancy in Reports : XXXX Equifax report lists the account as "" Collection/Charge-Off. '' Another Equifax report lists the account as "" XXXX, '' but still includes the "" charge-off '' notation, which is inaccurate given the settled nature of the account. 

These discrepancies create confusion and fail to meet the FCRA 's requirement for credit reporting agencies to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report ( 15 USC 1681e ( b ) ). 

Legal Concerns : XXXX. Violation of FCRA Accuracy Requirements : XXXX issuance of two reports with contradictory information fails to ensure accuracy and causes harm to my creditworthiness. 
XXXX. Failure to Investigate and Correct Disputes : Equifax has not corrected these errors despite my attempts to dispute the inaccuracies, violating 15 USC 1681i ( a ), which requires reinvestigation and resolution within 30 days. This account has been reporting inaccuracies for over XXXX years. 



Impact of the Errors : The conflicting reports and false remarks damage my credit profile and hinder my ability to secure financial opportunities. This is a clear violation of my consumer rights under federal law. 

Requested Actions : I am formally requesting the removal of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  account from my credit report due to these violations of the FCRA. The failure to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information reported and the issuance of contradictory reports constitute grounds for deletion. 

Additionally, I respectfully request the following : XXXX. An investigation into XXXX reporting practices and their failure to address these inaccuracies. 


XXXX. Immediate action to ensure all incorrect, unverifiable, or inconsistent information on my credit report is corrected or removed. 

XXXX. Confirmation of the removal of the disputed account from my credit report in writing. 

Supporting Documentation : I have enclosed the following documents for your review : XXXX. Copies of two different Equifax credit reports showing conflicting information. 

XXXX settlement letter from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX verifying the resolution of the account. 

I look forward to your acknowledgment of this complaint and an update on any actions taken. If additional information or documentation is required, I am happy to provide it. You may contact me at this email XXXX. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for taking steps to protect consumers from these unfair credit reporting practices.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"[ XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ] [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ] [ XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ] [ XXXX ] [ XXXX ] [ Date : XX/XX/XXXX ] Equifax Information Services LLC XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Subject : Demand for Resolution, Compensation, and Accountability Regarding Credit File Mismanagement To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally demand resolution and compensation from Equifax Information Services LLC due to your willful noncompliance, negligence, and mismanagement of my credit file, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) regulations. The inaccuracies and deceptive practices I have encountered have caused substantial emotional and financial harm.

Over the past months, I have disputed several inaccuracies and fraudulent accounts on my credit report. Despite providing adequate documentation to support my claims, Equifax has consistently denied my disputes without conducting the thorough investigations required under the FCRA. The specifics of my complaints are as follows : 1. **Unauthorized Updates During Investigations** : Negative statements were added to my credit file while my disputes were still under investigation, misleading potential creditors.

2. **Failure to Address Specific Discrepancies** :
- Accounts linked to XXXX XXXX/ and its parent company XXXX XXXX inaccurately reported accruing balances for over 81 months.XXXX XXXX misrepresented subsidiarys accounts without legal justification ; and EQUIFAX willfully complied in this illegal misrepresentation and reinsertion. Specifically, the reinserted account from XXXX XXXX XXXX violates **15 U.S.C. 1681i ( b ) **, which states that consumers must be notified of the reinsertion of information that had previously been removed from their credit report without proper validation. 
- XXXX XXXX reported inflated debt for a fraudulent account. 
- XXXX XXXX inflated debt amounts regarding fraudulent accounts. 
- XXXX XXXX XXXX provided a fraudulent T-Mobile bill. 

Each of these accounts was disputed numerous times, yet they were reported as updated and verified without a proper investigation. After escalating the matter to the CFPB, XXXX, FTC, and the Federal Reserve, these inaccuracies were only deleted XXXX months later.

3. **Ongoing Misreporting of Student Loans** : Two Department of Education student loans, currently in litigation, are inaccurately reported as XXXX days late and marked as 180 days past due while showing a XXXX balance. Equifax acknowledged this situation but continues to report it inaccurately, violating **FCRA 611 ( a ) **, which ensures that investigations into disputed information are conducted promptly.

4. **Inconsistent Correspondence on Identity Verification** : I received four notifications regarding my disputes, three from the CFPB and XXXX that was contradictory. While my name and address were finally corrected, inconsistent communication demonstrates Equifax 's disregard for compliance with regulatory guidelines.

5. **Failure to Provide Validation of Debt** : Under **15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) **, debt collectors are required to provide validation of the debt upon request. Your failure to confirm the accuracy of debts listed, particularly those from XXXX XXXX and its subsidiaries ; as well as XXXX XXXX, constitutes a violation. Additionally, the situation exemplified in **XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX **, reinforces that reinserted accounts require valid documentation to substantiate their existence in consumer credit reports. 

Equifax 's actions are clear violations of the following statutes : - **FCRA 1681i** : Requires credit reporting agencies to conduct reasonable investigations into disputed information, which Equifax failed to perform in my case.

- **FCRA 609** : Grants consumers the right to request and obtain a disclosure of the information in their consumer reports, which correlates with your obligation to verify accuracy.

- **FTC Guidelines on Credit Reporting** : Enforce transparency and accountability, which Equifax has neglected, leading to significant damage to my credit standing. 

I believe I am entitled to compensation for the violations of these statutes. Therefore, I am formally demanding compensation in the amount of ** $ XXXX, calculated at ** {$1000.00} per violation** as allowed under the FCRA and reflective of the emotional and financial injuries incurred due to Equifaxs misconduct.

Additionally, I require that Equifax address these issues immediately. This includes : - Adequate and timely responses to all future complaints and disputes. 
- Thorough investigations into the accuracy of my credit file. 
- A review and correction of your identity verification requests, ensuring they do not replace the necessary diligence in investigating reported information. 

I expect a comprehensive response addressing my demands and outlining the corrective actions you will take within **15 days**. If I do not receive an adequate resolution by that time, I will pursue legal action to protect my rights under the FCRA and FTC regulations and seek the compensation mentioned above. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this serious matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution.

I have reviewed my credit report as of [ Insert Date ], and I have identified the following errors that require immediate correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Below is a detailed explanation of the disputed accounts and the inaccuracies : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( Account Ending in XXXX XXXX - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : The account shows a credit usage of 268 %, which is mathematically impossible given a {$300.00} credit limit. 
Requested Correction : Verify and update the balance and credit usage to reflect accurate and lawful reporting. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account Ending in XXXX  ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : This account appears to duplicate the above account from XX/XX/XXXX. Both accounts indicate charge-offs, but there is no clarification as to whether they represent the same debt. 
Requested Correction : Investigate and delete any duplicate reporting. If they are separate obligations, please provide detailed documentation to verify the legitimacy of both accounts. 

XXXX. XXXX  ( Account Ending in XXXX  ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : The account shows a credit usage of 127 %, which exceeds the reported {$700.00} credit limit. Additionally, the last payment date and balance update timelines are inconsistent. 
Requested Correction : Verify and correct the credit usage and balance. Provide clarification on the reporting discrepancies for the timeline of updates. 

XXXX. XXXXXXXX XXXX ( Account Ending in XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : This account shows a credit usage of 201 % with a {$600.00} limit and an outstanding balance of {$1200.00}. Additionally, the comment mentions first payment never received, but the report lacks detail on whether this is accurate. 
Requested Correction : Verify and update the reported credit usage and outstanding balance. Clarify and provide evidence to support the comment listed under this account. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Account Ending in XXXX  ) - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Inaccuracy : The report states : Collection account. {$1800.00} past due as of XX/XX/XXXX, but there is no indication whether the debt is with the original creditor or a third-party collector. 
The timeline for updates is inconsistent, with Status Updated in XX/XX/XXXX and Balance Updated in XX/XX/XXXX, despite the account being opened less than a year before. 
The terms listed as 1 month do not align with the balance reported unless additional charges ( e.g., termination fees ) are properly documented. 
Requested Correction : Investigate the validity of this collection account, verify the timeline for updates, and ensure the balance reflects lawful reporting. Clarify whether the debt remains with XXXX or has been sold to a collection agency. 

XXXX. General Reporting Errors Inaccurate Status Updates : Several accounts reflect conflicting last payment dates and status update dates ( e.g., balance updates for closed accounts ). 
Duplicate Reporting : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX accounts appear redundant. 
Requested Correction : Ensure that all statuses, dates, and balances are accurately reflected. 

I have attached a copy of my credit report with the disputed accounts highlighted for your reference, along with a copy of my government-issued ID and proof of address to verify my identity. 

Please conduct a thorough investigation into these issues and provide me with the results of your findings. If you determine that the disputed information is inaccurate, I request that you promptly update my credit report to reflect the corrections and notify any creditors that received the incorrect information. 

In accordance with the FCRA, I expect a response within 30 days. You may contact me via mail at the address above or by phone at ( XXXX ) XXXX if you require additional information.

The inaccuracies and deceptive practices I have encountered have caused substantial emotional and financial harm. 

Over the past months, I have disputed several inaccuracies and fraudulent accounts on my credit report. Despite providing adequate documentation to support my claims, Equifax has consistently denied my disputes without conducting the thorough investigations required under the FCRA. The specifics of my complaints are as follows : 1. **Unauthorized Updates During Investigations** : Negative statements were added to my credit file while my disputes were still under investigation, misleading potential creditors.

2. **Failure to Address Specific Discrepancies** : - Accounts linked to World Finance/ and its parent company XXXX XXXX  inaccurately reported accruing balances for over 81 months.XXXX XXXX misrepresented subsidiarys accounts without legal justification ; and EQUIFAX willfully complied in this illegal misrepresentation and reinsertion. Specifically, the reinserted account from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX violates **15 U.S.C. 1681i ( b ) **, which states that consumers must be notified of the reinsertion of information that had previously been removed from their credit report without proper validation. 
- XXXX XXXX reported inflated debt for a fraudulent account. 
- XXXX XXXX inflated debt amounts regarding fraudulent accounts. 
- XXXX XXXX XXXX provided a fraudulent T-Mobile bill. 

Each of these accounts was disputed numerous times, yet they were reported as updated and verified without a proper investigation. After escalating the matter to the CFPB, XXXX, FTC, and the Federal Reserve, these inaccuracies were only deleted XXXX months later.

3. **Ongoing Misreporting of Student Loans** : Two Department of Education student loans, currently in litigation, are inaccurately reported as XXXX days late and marked as 180 days past due while showing a XXXX balance. Equifax acknowledged this situation but continues to report it inaccurately, violating **FCRA 611 ( a ) **, which ensures that investigations into disputed information are conducted promptly.

4. **Inconsistent Correspondence on Identity Verification** : I received four notifications regarding my disputes, three from the CFPB and one that was contradictory. While my name and address were finally corrected, inconsistent communication demonstrates Equifax 's disregard for compliance with regulatory guidelines.

5. **Failure to Provide Validation of Debt** : Under **15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) **, debt collectors are required to provide validation of the debt upon request. Your failure to confirm the accuracy of debts listed, particularly those from XXXX XXXX and its subsidiaries ; as well as XXXX XXXX, constitutes a violation. Additionally, the situation exemplified in **XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX **, reinforces that reinserted accounts require valid documentation to substantiate their existence in consumer credit reports. 

Equifax 's actions are clear violations of the following statutes : - **FCRA 1681i** : Requires credit reporting agencies to conduct reasonable investigations into disputed information, which Equifax failed to perform in my case.

- **FCRA 609** : Grants consumers the right to request and obtain a disclosure of the information in their consumer reports, which correlates with your obli
gation to verify accuracy.

- **FTC Guidelines on Credit Reporting** : Enforce transparency and accountability, which Equifax has neglected, leading to significant damage to my credit standing.

I believe I am entitled to compensation for the violations of these statutes. Therefore, I am formally demanding compensation in the amount of ** $ XXXX, calculated at ** {$1000.00} per violation** as allowed under the FCRA and reflective of the emotional and financial injuries incurred due to Equifaxs misconduct.

Additionally, I require that Equifax address these issues immediately. This includes : - Adequate and timely responses to all future complaints and disputes. 
- Thorough investigations into the accuracy of my credit file. 
- A review and correction of your identity verification requests, ensuring they do not replace the necessary diligence in investigating reported information.

I expect a comprehensive response addressing my demands and outlining the corrective actions you will take within **15 days**. If I do not receive an adequate resolution by that time, I will pursue legal action to protect my rights under the FCRA and FTC regulations and seek the compensation mentioned above. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this serious matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution.

Despite my efforts over the past three years to provide evidence of identity theft, neither XXXX XXXX nor the credit bureaus ( XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX ) have taken appropriate steps to resolve this matter. 

Here are the critical facts of this issue : 1. Identity Theft and Disputed Accounts : I was a victim of identity, a time during which two XXXX XXXX accounts in good standing were fraudulently used. 
I provided police reports and a Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report to XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus, documenting this crime and disputing the debts. 
Despite clear evidence that these debts were not mine, XXXX XXXX refused to acknowledge the theft or resolve the accounts appropriately. 
2. Lawsuit Filed and Dismissed : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  pursued legal action against me in 2024, despite the ongoing identity theft dispute and my inability to pay for debts that were not mine. 
On XX/XX/year>, the court dismissed the case for want of prosecution ( DWOP ), with no judgment entered against me. This dismissal further supports my position that this debt is invalid and should not have been pursued in the first place. 
3. Credit Reporting Negligence : Despite the dismissal and my repeated disputes, all three credit bureaus continue to report inaccurate and derogatory information related to these accounts and lawsuit. 
The excuse provided by XXXXthat the lawsuit was filed and therefore can not be removedis baseless given that the case was dismissed, and the accounts were the result of identity theft. 
The continued failure to address this issue violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates accurate and fair credit reporting. 

This negligence has severely impacted my credit standing and financial stability for years. The prolonged failure to remove fraudulent accounts and the erroneous lawsuit from my credit file has caused undue hardship, limiting my ability to rebuild after the closure of my business.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TX,79905,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11314324

As of XX/XX/year>, after submitting a formal dispute, XXXX completed their investigation and deleted the account from my XXXX report. Please find the relevant details of the account : Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Type : Charge-Off Amount : {$1000.00} Dispute Resolution Date : XX/XX/year> Outcome : Account Deleted According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), a consumer is entitled to accurate and verifiable information being reported on their credit report. Since XXXX has completed their investigation and determined that the information is unverifiable, they have deleted this account from my XXXX credit file. 

In light of the deletion from XXXX, I kindly request that all other credit reporting agencies, including but not limited to Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX, conduct a thorough review of this account. If these agencies can not verify this debt, I am requesting that they remove the account from my credit reports as well. The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must ensure that any information they report is accurate, and if they can not verify the information, it must be deleted. 

Legal Basis for Removal : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Section 1681i : This section states that if any information is found to be inaccurate or unverifiable during a dispute process, it must be removed or corrected. Given that XXXX has deleted the account, the other CRAs are obligated to ensure their reports reflect accurate and verified information. 

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Section 1681e ( b ) : Requires that credit reporting agencies maintain procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information reported. 

Please take notice that I am requesting the removal of this unverifiable account within 30 days or less. If the account is not removed in the specified timeframe, I reserve the right to pursue legal action, including suing for violation of my rights under the FCRA. I understand that under FCRA Section 1681n, I may be entitled to seek damages if my rights have been violated, including statutory damages and attorney fees.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the incorrect reporting of several accounts on my credit report by Equifax and its failure to properly investigate or correct these errors. The following accounts are being inaccurately reported, causing harm to my credit standing and violating my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ).

Accounts in Question : First Premier Bank Account ( Charge-Off ) - {$620.00} The account is reported as a charge-off, but I have disputed this information as it does not accurately reflect the status of the account. It is my belief that the charge-off was reported prematurely or inaccurately. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account ( Charge-Off ) - {$1000.00} Similar to the previous account, this is another charge-off that is inaccurately reported on my credit report. I have disputed this information and request that it be verified or deleted. 
XXXX XXXX Account ( # XXXX ) - {$21000.00} ( Paid ) The XXXX account is reported as "" Paid '', but it still reflects an outstanding balance of {$21000.00}, which is incorrect. The account should reflect either a XXXX balance or "" Paid in Full '' with no remaining balance. Despite my efforts to resolve this, Equifax has not corrected this discrepancy. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Account ( Collection ) - {$310.00} ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  account is reported as a collection. I have requested validation of this debt, but Equifax has not provided adequate documentation or verified the accuracy of the reported debt. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Account ( # XXXX ) - {$670.00} ( Collection ) The XXXX XXXX XXXX account is listed as in collection. I have disputed the accuracy of this account, as I believe it does not match my records or has been improperly reported. 
Background and Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Under the FCRA, I am entitled to a credit report that is accurate, complete, and verifiable. The information reported by Equifax and other creditors is clearly inaccurate and misleading, which is a violation of my rights under the FCRA. Specifically : FCRA Section 607 ( b ) requires that credit reporting agencies like Equifax ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information they report.

FCRA Section 611 ( a ) mandates that if an item on a credit report is disputed, the credit reporting agency must investigate and resolve the dispute within 30 days. However, Equifax has failed to correct the inaccuracies on my credit report despite my repeated disputes. 
Request for Resolution : I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) assist in the following : Investigate the inaccurate reporting of the accounts listed above, which were not properly validated or corrected by Equifax. 
Ensure that the accounts from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX are accurately reported, and that any unverifiable information is removed from my credit report. 
Ensure that Equifax complies with the FCRA by thoroughly investigating these disputes and correcting any inaccuracies, including providing proper documentation where necessary. 
Confirm that the XXXX account is correctly updated to reflect XXXX balance or "" Paid in Full '' status, as the account should not have any remaining balance. 
Provide a copy of my corrected credit report showing the changes made to these accounts. 


I trust that the CFPB will take swift and appropriate action to ensure that Equifax complies with the FCRA and FDCPA, and that the inaccurate information on my credit report is corrected. I appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter promptly. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter. I look forward to your response and the swift resolution of my complaint.

I demand to see a copy of the Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) that you used to verify that the account belonged to me the first time you reported the account on my credit report. Your failure to properly verify these accounts has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Under the FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681, unverified accounts must be promptly deleted. If you are unable to provide me with a copy of the verifiable proof that you have on file within 30 days for each of the accounts listed below, then you must remove these accounts from my credit report.

Specifically, I am addressing issues with a XXXX XXXX  account that is reporting in violation of credit reporting regulations. The following inaccuracies are causing significant harm to my credit score, and I am requesting immediate action to correct or remove these entries. 

XXXX. Re-aged Account XXXX XXXX XXXX  account is being reported with a re-aged date, which is a violation of credit reporting standards. This account should reflect its original date of delinquency and not a re-aged or altered date. This deliberate misrepresentation is harmful to my credit profile, and I demand the immediate removal of the re-aged date. 

2. Balance on Closed Account XXXX XXXX XXXX  account is also showing a balance despite being closed. A closed account should not reflect any outstanding balance. This inaccurate information is misleading and must be corrected immediately by removing the balance reported on this account. 

XXXX. Account Showing as Over the Limit The same account is incorrectly reporting as over the credit limit, despite being closed. A closed account should not be subject to over-limit reporting, and this misrepresentation of the accounts status is not only misleading but also unlawful. 

These inaccuracies are in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates that all information reported to credit bureaus must be accurate and complete. The continued presence of these errors is damaging my credit score and may have broader implications on my financial well-being. 

I request that XXXX immediately investigate and correct the reporting of this XXXXXXXX XXXX account. The re-aged date must be removed, the balance on the closed account must be eliminated, and the over-limit status must be corrected to accurately reflect the closed status of the account. If XXXX is unable to correct these inaccuracies, I request that they be removed entirely from my credit report. 

Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint and confirm the actions taken to resolve these issues. I trust that the CFPB will assist in ensuring that my credit report accurately reflects my financial history and that these discrepancies are resolved promptly.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear CFPB, I am filing this formal complaint regarding several violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by credit reporting agencies and debt buyers. These violations include inaccurate reporting of charge-offs, unauthorized inquiries, incorrect personal information ADDRESS NAMES, and errors that continue to harm my credit profile. Despite my efforts to resolve these matters directly, the violations remain unaddressed. I seek your intervention to enforce the law and hold the responsible parties accountable. 
MY NAME XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Re : Violations of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) I recently got a copy of my consumer file and noticed that there was inaccurate information. According to the FCRA you must be reporting 100 % correct information at all times and that is not what my credit file reflects at this time. You have 30 days to remove the personal information listed in this letter. I am also requesting you to provide me with the furnisher of this information or where you got this information from. Please PERMANENTLY REMOVE the following. 
This letter serves as a demand for immediate corrective actions, including the removal of inaccurate information from my credit report and the imposition of appropriate fines and penalties for your non-compliance.the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S. Code 1692. I demand immediate corrective actions, including the removal of inaccurate information, imposition of fines, and enforcement of compliance with relevant laws You are referring to a portion of 15 U.S. Code 1681c ( a ), which outlines restrictions on the inclusion of certain types of information in consumer reports. Here 's a rewritten version of the relevant clause with clarity on what consumer reporting agencies can not include : Consumer reporting agencies are prohibited from including in a consumer report any adverse items of information ( other than records of convictions of crimes ) that are older than 7 years. This includes adverse financial data such as : Accounts sent to collections. 
Charged-off accounts. 
Any other negative financial information. 
However, records of convictions of crimes are an exception to this rule and may be reported beyond the 7-year limitation. 
This provision ensures that outdated and irrelevant negative information ( except criminal convictions ) does not unfairly impact a consumer 's creditworthiness or access to opportunities.

Here 's a clear summary : 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) - Duty of Furnishers to Provide Accurate Information 1. Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information : A furnisher ( such as a creditor or lender ) can not knowingly furnish information to a consumer reporting agency if : The information is inaccurate. 
The furnisher has reason to believe the information is inaccurate. 
2. Obligation to Update and Correct Information : If the furnisher discovers that previously provided information is inaccurate or incomplete, they must : Promptly correct or update the information.

Notify all consumer reporting agencies to which the inaccurate information was furnished.

Would you like further details or help crafting a notice or dispute related to this? 
Under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), it is explicitly prohibited for any person to furnish information to a consumer reporting agency if : The information relates to a transaction or experience ( e.g., payment history ) that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe involves an illegal activity. 
This includes any dealings or transactions, such as reporting payment history or account activities, that are associated with unlawful conduct. Reporting such information is considered a violation of federal law and undermines the integrity of consumer reporting. 
Let me know if you need help drafting this into a formal letter or document! 
Under 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( f ), the illegal reporting of inquiries refers to the prohibition of accessing or furnishing consumer reports for impermissible purposes. Here 's how this applies : Illegal Reporting of Inquiries : A consumer reporting agency or any person shall not obtain or use a consumer report unless : 1. The report is requested for a permissible purpose as outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( a ) ( e.g., credit applications, employment, insurance underwriting ). 
2. The requester has a legitimate business need for the information, authorized by the consumer or required by law. 
If an inquiry appears on a consumer 's credit report without a valid permissible purpose or the consumer 's authorization, this constitutes illegal reporting of inquiries. Such unauthorized inquiries can harm a consumer 's credit score or appear as misuse of their personal information. 

Would you like help drafting a dispute letter to address unauthorized inquiries or further explanation of permissible purposes?

Consumer Interview System XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 1. Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681b Permissible Purposes of Consumer Reports The credit reporting agencies have violated 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 604 ) ( a ) by furnishing my consumer report to third-party debt buyers who do not have a valid contract with me. I have not authorized these parties to access or report on my credit file, yet their erroneous entries, including charge-offs and other derogatory marks, continue to appear on my report. 
2. Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information Creditors and debt collectors, who have no valid contractual relationship with me, have continued to report charge-off accounts that have been sold to third parties. These furnishers are violating 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) by reporting inaccurate and outdated information, which misrepresents the status of the debts. Once an account has been sold, the original creditor no longer has the legal standing to report it as active.

Reporting Charge-Offs which is Income Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681c Creditors have unlawfully reported charge-off amounts as income, which is explicitly prohibited under 15 U.S. Code 1681c. This practice is not only misleading but also illegal, as it distorts the accuracy of my financial records. Such actions are further compounded by the failure to update the information to reflect that the debts have been sold, which results in a violation of 15 U.S. Code 1666.

No Valid Contract with Debt Buyers Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681b Under 15 U.S. Code 1681b, consumer reporting agencies and creditors may only report information backed by a valid contract with the consumer. Debt buyers reporting my accounts have no such legal standing, as I never entered into any agreement with these third-party collectors. Therefore, their continued reporting is a violation of the FCRA and a clear breach of federal law. 
5. Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Ensuring Accuracy in Reporting Credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum accuracy of the information they report under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ). However, the continued inclusion of inaccurate charge-off accounts, misreported debts, and outdated information on my credit report demonstrates their failure to comply with this legal obligation.

6. Adverse Information Reporting Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 5 ) The reporting of adverse information, including sold charge-offs, violates 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 5 ). Adverse information can not be reported without ensuring it reflects the accurate status of the account. The failure to update my report with correct information constitutes a blatant violation of the FCRA. 
7. Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1692b ( 5 ), 1692d ( 2 ), and 1692c ( a ) FDCPA Violations The debt collectors in question have also violated the Fair Debt Collection I 3. Sold Charge-Offs Reported by Original Creditors Violations of 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) Creditors are prohibited from reporting debts they no longer own under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ). However, several sold charge-off accounts are still being reported as though they are owned by the original creditor. This misrepresentation misleads credit reporting agencies and potential lenders, violating both the FCRA and my consumer rights. These accounts should be immediately removed, and the creditors should face fines for this violation.

Summary of the Issue : Account in Question : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Discrepancy in Reports : One Equifax report lists the account as "" Collection/Charge-Off.

Legal Concerns : 1. Violation of FCRA Accuracy Requirements : Equifaxs issuance of two reports with contradictory information fails to ensure accuracy and causes harm to my creditworthiness.

2. Failure to Investigate and Correct Disputes : Equifax has not corrected these errors despite my attempts to dispute the inaccuracies, violating 15 USC 1681i ( a ), which requires reinvestigation and resolution within 30 days. This account has been reporting inaccuracies for over 3 years.

Impact of the Errors : The conflicting reports and false remarks damage my credit profile and hinder my ability to secure financial opportunities. This is a clear violation of my consumer rights under federal law.

Requested Actions : I am formally requesting the removal of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account from my credit report due to these violations of the FCRA. The failure to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information reported and the issuance of contradictory reports constitute grounds for deletion.

Additionally, I respectfully request the following : 1. An investigation into Equifaxs reporting practices and their failure to address these inaccuracies.

2. Immediate action to ensure all incorrect, unverifiable, or inconsistent information on my credit report is corrected or removed.

3. Confirmation of the removal of the disputed account from my credit report in writing.

Five months ago, I deposited a check for the amount of {$4000.00} that was mistakenly identified by KeyBank as a third-party check due to an incomplete name. After depositing the check, KeyBank closed my account and has not released the funds. 

I have complied with all of KeyBank 's requests, including providing a notarized letter from the payee. KeyBank assured me the funds would be released after submission of the documents, but they have failed to do so. 

KeyBank 's Actions : KeyBank claimed they sent hold harmless and restitution forms to XXXX XXXX XXXX, the issuers bank. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX  has informed the issuer that they never received these forms or any communication from KeyBank regarding this matter. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX  also notified the issuer that the only way to receive the funds back would be by claiming fraud, which is not true. This is an unreasonable and unfair requirement, as it is not a case of fraud. 
The issuer, together with their bank, tried to contact KeyBank multiple times, but no one answered the phone. I even offered to arrange a call between all parties to verify that this is not fraud, but KeyBank did not accept or respond to my offer. 
KeyBank has repeatedly told me a different excuse each time I have called. They have claimed that the funds were sent, only to be contradicted in subsequent calls when I was told that the funds were not sent. I was also told that I should request the issuer to check with their bank to see if they received the forms, but XXXX XXXX XXXX  confirmed that they never received them. 
Additionally, I was told to have the issuer check with their bank to see if they received the funds, but again, XXXX XXXX XXXX reported that no such funds were sent. 
I have made multiple phone calls, visited the branch, and followed all instructions given by KeyBank, but I am still no closer to resolving this issue.",,KEYCORP,NY,10977,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11316406

Equifax has required me to provide proof of my identity and correct address because the information they have does not match, yet they continue to fail in resolving the fraudulent accounts on my credit report.

Details of the Complaint : 1. Equifaxs Failure to Act : Equifax has sent me requests to verify my identity and address, claiming the information they have does not match. 
I provided my government-issued ID passport and my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX proof of address, yet Equifax has made no effort to fix my credit report by removing the fraudulent accounts. 
2.

Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Under the FCRA, Equifax is obligated to ensure the accuracy of credit reports and to promptly address disputes. 
Their requirement to verify my identity while failing to act on the fraudulent accounts I have reported is unacceptable and a failure to comply with the law. 

Impact on Me : Equifaxs mishandling of my case has caused significant emotional distress and financial harm. The fraudulent accounts remain on my credit report, damaging my credit score and preventing me from accessing credit or other financial opportunities. 

Desired Resolution : I request the CFPB to ensure that Equifax takes the following actions : 1. Remove Fraudulent Accounts : Immediately investigate and remove all fraudulent accounts, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from my credit report. 
2. Provide a Corrected Credit Report : Issue me a corrected credit report that reflects the removal of these fraudulent accounts.

I believe that Equifax has engaged in activities that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), and the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act. 

I have sent Equifax a notice requesting that they stop making reports on my personal finances. Despite this notice, they have failed to comply. The FCRA and the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act clearly state that consumers have the right to privacy, and I feel that my rights and liberties have been infringed upon by Equifaxs actions. My personal life and financial information should not be used for profit by a non-government agency, especially when I receive no benefit from such practices. 

I am particularly concerned about the following issues : 1. **Aggravated Identity Theft** : Equifax has purchased my private information from other corporations and subsequently sold this nonpublic information to other entities without my consent. I was not given any opportunity or notice to opt out of credit reporting, which constitutes a violation of my privacy rights. 

2. **Extortion and Coercion** : Equifax appears to be actively engaged in coercive practices by advertising nonpayment of debt as a means to influence payment. They have also made reports that are designed to disgrace and embarrass me as a consumer, which is a clear violation of the FDCPA and FCRA.

3. **False Reporting** : The reporting of false and inaccurate nonpublic information by Equifax has caused me severe distress, injuries, and damages. This practice seems to be a means for them to profit from the misuse of my stolen identifying information. 

I urge your offices to investigate Equifax for these violations and take appropriate action to protect consumers like myself from such unethical and unlawful practices. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response. 

Sincerely THE IS NO DEBT OWED ON THIS ACCOUNT THIS ACCOUNT SHOULD STILL REPORT AS A COLLECTION OR CHARGE OFF.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",VA,20176,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11316894

As your legal team can confirm, under the rules of evidence, the company must produce the original document to establish standing in any claim. Furthermore, they have failed to return the debt collector certification, further discrediting their claim.

I believe that Equifax has engaged in activities that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), and the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act.

I have sent Equifax a notice requesting that they stop making reports on my personal finances. Despite this notice, they have failed to comply. The FCRA and the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act clearly state that consumers have the right to privacy, and I feel that my rights and liberties have been infringed upon by Equifaxs actions. My personal life and financial information should not be used for profit by a non-government agency, especially when I receive no benefit from such practices. 

I am particularly concerned about the following issues : 1. **Aggravated Identity Theft** : Equifax has purchased my private information from other corporations and subsequently sold this nonpublic information to other entities without my consent. I was not given any opportunity or notice to opt out of credit reporting, which constitutes a violation of my privacy rights. 

2. **Extortion and Coercion** : Equifax appears to be actively engaged in coercive practices by advertising nonpayment of debt as a means to influence payment. They have also made reports that are designed to disgrace and embarrass me as a consumer, which is a clear violation of the FDCPA and FCRA.

3. **False Reporting** : The reporting of false and inaccurate nonpublic information by Equifax has caused me severe distress, injuries, and damages. This practice seems to be a means for them to profit from the misuse of my stolen identifying information. 

I urge your offices to investigate Equifax for these violations and take appropriate action to protect consumers like myself from such unethical and unlawful practices. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

On XX/XX/year>, I applied to an online credit card offer and was immediately approved to the given specified terms and conditions.

On XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX the second billing statement arrived with a balance of xxxxx this time there was a decision to apply a XXXX XXXX  interest rate. 

In summary, American Express has mention they have complete control setting all credit card terms and condition at any time.

Is there any enactment to abolish this type of behavior?

As referenced in the Equifax Data Breach Settlement, reference number XXXX. These inaccuracies are having a direct and negative impact on my credit worthiness and I demand immediate action to rectify this matter. 


XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Equifax Consumer Services Center XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : Immediate Removal of Derogatory Trade Lines and Inquiries Resulting from Data Breach Dear Equifax, I am writing regarding the grave violation of my privacy and consumer rights resulting from the Equifax Data Breach, which exposed my personal information to unauthorized parties. As a result of this breach, I have identified derogatory trade lines and unauthorized inquiries on my credit report that are both inaccurate and detrimental to my financial well-being.

These inaccuracies have a significant and unlawful impact on my credit report and have occurred through no fault of my own. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and relevant consumer protection laws, Equifax is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of my credit information and is obligated to promptly correct any inaccuracies caused by errors or unauthorized activity.

To rectify this matter, I demand the following actions be taken within five ( 5 ) days of receipt of this letter : Remove all unauthorized and unknown trade lines immediately.

Remove all unauthorized inquiries made on my credit file.

Provide a full investigation report detailing the steps Equifax will take to ensure my personal information is secure moving forward.

The information on my credit file is irrefutably compromised due to Equifax 's negligence. I have documentation confirming that my personal information was compromised as a direct result of the breach. This negligence entitles me to relief under the FCRA and potentially other federal and state laws protecting consumers against such abuses.

Failure to resolve this matter within the given timeframe will compel me to escalate this issue further, including pursuing legal remedies and filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).

I am also submitting this letter to the CFPB and request their intervention to ensure Equifax complies with consumer protection laws and eliminates the inaccurate derogatory accounts resulting from the data breach. My expectation is that Equifax, with the assistance of the CFPB, will act promptly to restore my credit profile to its accurate and fair state.

Please confirm receipt of this letter and inform me once all actions have been completed. I can be reached XXXX XXXX for any additional information you may require.

Sincerely, XXXX - XXXX XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : Assistance Required to Rectify Credit File Inaccuracies Following Equifax Data Breach Dear CFPB, I am reaching out for your assistance as my rights as a consumer have been violated as a result of the Equifax Data Breach. My personal information was compromised during the breach, resulting in the appearance of derogatory trade lines and unauthorized inquiries on my Equifax credit report.

Equifax has failed to correct the inaccuracies promptly despite their obligation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am requesting that the CFPB intervenes to ensure these violations are addressed and that my credit file is corrected within five ( 5 ) days.

I am attaching relevant documentation, including proof of compromised personal information, and I urge your agency to hold Equifax accountable to consumer laws to protect me and others similarly affected.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift response.

Equifax has required me to provide proof of my identity and correct address because the information they have does not match, yet they continue to fail in resolving the fraudulent accounts on my credit report. 

Details of the Complaint : 1. Equifaxs Failure to Act : Equifax has sent me requests to verify my identity and address, claiming the information they have does not match. 
I provided my government-issued ID passport and my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX proof of address, yet Equifax has made no effort to fix my credit report by removing the fraudulent accounts.

2. Fraudulent Accounts from Data Breach : The Equifax data breach exposed my sensitive personal information, resulting in several fraudulent accounts being opened in my name, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) 3. Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Under the FCRA, Equifax is obligated to ensure the accuracy of credit reports and to promptly address disputes. 
Their requirement to verify my identity while failing to act on the fraudulent accounts I have reported is unacceptable and a failure to comply with the law. 

Impact on Me : Equifaxs mishandling of my case has caused significant emotional distress and financial harm. The fraudulent accounts remain on my credit report, damaging my credit score and preventing me from accessing credit or other financial opportunities. 

Desired Resolution : I request the CFPB to ensure that Equifax takes the following actions : XXXX. Remove Fraudulent Accounts : Immediately investigate and remove all fraudulent accounts, including XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and XXXX XXXXXXXX, from my credit report. 
2. Provide a Corrected Credit Report : Issue me a corrected credit report that reflects the removal of these fraudulent accounts. 
XXXX. Acknowledge Verified Information : Accept and use the government-issued ID and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX statement I have provided to update their records, preventing further delays. 
4. Confirm Compliance in Writing : Provide written confirmation that my identity has been verified, the fraudulent accounts have been removed, and my credit report has been corrected.

5. Prevent Further Excuses : Ensure Equifax stops delaying the resolution of disputes by requiring repetitive identity verification without taking appropriate action to fix credit reports. 

Supporting Documents : I am prepared to provide the following : Copy of my government-issued ID ( e.g., drivers license or passport ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX statement as proof of address FTC Identity Theft Report IC3 Complaint Report Conclusion : Equifaxs repeated delays and excuses in resolving my credit report disputes are unacceptable and have caused undue hardship.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"This letter is a formal complaint to Equifax, stating that inaccurate negative information, specifically late payments that were not actually late, was reported on the credit report without proper verification or consent, significantly impacting the credit score and causing credit denial due to the inaccurate data. The consumer is citing various sections of the U.S. Code related to consumer protection and credit reporting, emphasizing that they were not given the opportunity to opt out of sharing their information and that Equifax failed to adequately verify the information reported by third-party companies before impacting their credit score. 
Key points of the complaint : Incorrect information : The consumer claims all payments were made on time, yet their credit report shows late payments, which is considered inaccurate and misleading. 
Lack of verification : Equifax did not properly verify the information with the consumer before reporting negative information from third-party companies, violating consumer protection laws.

No consent : The consumer did not provide consent for their information to be shared with third parties and negatively impact their credit score without proper verification.

Legal references : The letter cites specific sections of the U.S. Code including 15 U.S. Code 6802, 6803, and 1692c, highlighting the legal right to accurate credit reporting and the requirement for consumer consent.

Impact on credit score : The inaccurate information has resulted in credit denial, causing significant financial harm to the consumer.

What the consumer is demanding : Immediate correction : Equifax should remove all inaccurate late payment information from the credit report.

Explanation of verification process : A detailed explanation of how the disputed information was verified and why the consumer was not notified about potential issues with their credit report.

Communication with third-party companies : Equifax should contact the third-party companies that provided the inaccurate information and ensure the correction is reflected across all credit reports.

Full copy of investigation : A complete copy of the investigation regarding the disputed information should be provided to the consumer via certified mail.

Next steps : Follow up : If Equifax does not address the concerns within a reasonable time frame, the consumer should consider contacting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to file a formal complaint. 

It has come to my attention that XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  has my information from ( CFPB ) my consumer report that is allowing my information to be used against my will and or knowledge. According to 15 U.S. Code 6802 - Obligations with respect to disclosures of personal information, I was never giving the opportunity to opt out of my information being viewed publicly and or against my Consent. 15 U.S. Code 1692c - Communication in connection with debt collection. 15 U.S. Code 6802 - Obligations with respect to disclosures of personal information. ( B ) the consumer is given the opportunity, before the time that such information is initially disclosed, to direct that such information not be disclosed to such third party ; and 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy. 15 U.S. Code 1692c - ( a ), ( b ), ( c ), Ownership : I have no knowledge of this account.

To Equifax, I am requesting an immediate update to my credit report to reflect all previously listed "" late payments '' as "" current/up-to-date '' or "" paid as agreed and always on time, '' as this inaccurate information has significantly impacted my ability to secure credit, including mortgages, auto loans, personal loans, and credit cards, due to the NEGATIVELY reporting on my credit history.

This reporting is misleading and inconsistent with the legal definition of a charged-off debt. Additionally, XXXX has refused to issue a Form 1099-C to document the cancellation of this debt, further complicating the situation. 

I filed a prior complaint ( XXXX ) with the CFPB about similar issues, but the investigation appears to have been incomplete. XXXX continues to report inaccurate information, despite my requests for correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Actions I have taken : Contacted XXXX directly to dispute the accounts inaccurate status, including their refusal to issue a Form 1099-C. 
Filed a previous complaint with the CFPB regarding this account. 
Actions taken by XXXX : Refused to issue a Form 1099-C while still reporting the debt as charged off. 
Continued to report an unpaid balance and delinquent status on my credit report. 
This inaccurate reporting has significantly harmed my credit and financial standing, and I believe it violates both FCRA accuracy standards and 26 U.S. Code 6050P, which governs the reporting of canceled debts. 

I respectfully request a thorough investigation of this issue, as I believe the previous investigation did not fully address these concerns or result in a fair resolution.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TX,78249,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11317102

This complaint was closed out based on inaccurate information provided by Citi. They continue to claim I filed the dispute outside of the XXXX required timeframe, but provide no data other than the date the transaction posted on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Here is the data that I confirmed with the customer service rep at Citi last week. 

Dispute filed on XX/XX/XXXX which is day XXXX ( not after 120 days as the response claimed ) I also confirmed with MasterCard that filing an initial dispute on day XXXX is satisfactory. 


When I started having challenges with my purchase, I called Citi in XXXX and was told I had until XX/XX/XXXX to file the dispute which I did I am not sure what is occurring on Citis end, but they obviously have a major flaw on their process. As a consumer, I should have the ability to speak with someone and I have asked for someone to call me no less than 10 times regarding this and not a single phone call. Each time I call, I reach someone in the XXXX that has no authority to make a decision nor can they transfer me to a US representative The only responses I get via email are through this complaint process and they provide no data or factual information. 

I ask that you research this further and hold the bank accountable to adhere to their own policy, governed by MasterCard This is starting to border on disparate treatment as theyre not honoring their cardholder agreement to me, the consumer Next step will be the Attorney General and if that is unsuccessful, I will file a lawsuit against Citi if I do not start getting some factual answers Again, I want to be clear, I know the regulations and asked the questions upfront to the customer service department which I followed everything to the letter.

I have encountered significant issues with their payment processing system, which have resulted in both confusion and unnecessary financial strain. Despite making my payments on time, I have received threatening letters from XXXX  claiming they did not receive my payments and stating they will contact credit agencies to report my late payments. 

Details of the Issue : XX/XX/XXXX : I made my mortgage payment through auto-pay as usual, and the payment was deposited into XXXX account. However, I later received a letter stating that they had not received my payment and that my account was overdue. I had to send an additional payment while they searched for the original payment. Weeks later, they found the payment and applied it to my account. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I sent my mortgage payment, which was deposited into XXXX account and endorsed on XX/XX/XXXX. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from XXXX  stating that they had not received the payment and that my account was now considered late. This is the second time this has happened. 
XX/XX/XXXX : After receiving the threatening letter, I made another payment for the same month to avoid any late fees or negative impact on my credit. However, I am now being asked to make my XX/XX/XXXX payment as well, leaving me effectively out an entire months mortgage and escrow payment while XXXX  attempts to locate my XXXX payment, which was already taken from my account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

This situation has caused significant stress and financial difficulty for me, as I have to pay twice for the same month while waiting for XXXX  to resolve their internal errors.

Equifax has required me to provide proof of my identity and correct address because the information they have does not match, yet they continue to fail in resolving the fraudulent accounts on my credit report.

Details of the Complaint : 1. Equifaxs Failure to Act : Equifax has sent me requests to verify my identity and address, claiming the information they have does not match. 
I provided my government-issued ID passport and my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX statement as proof of address, yet Equifax has made no effort to fix my credit report by removing the fraudulent accounts. 
2. Fraudulent Accounts from Data Breach : The Equifax data breach exposed my sensitive personal information, resulting in several fraudulent accounts being opened in my name, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) 3. Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Under the FCRA, Equifax is obligated to ensure the accuracy of credit reports and to promptly address disputes. 
Their requirement to verify my identity while failing to act on the fraudulent accounts I have reported is unacceptable and a failure to comply with the law. 

Impact on Me : Equifaxs mishandling of my case has caused significant emotional distress and financial harm. The fraudulent accounts remain on my credit report, damaging my credit score and preventing me from accessing credit or other financial opportunities. 

Desired Resolution : I request the CFPB to ensure that Equifax takes the following actions : 1. Remove Fraudulent Accounts : Immediately investigate and remove all fraudulent accounts, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from my credit report. 
2. Provide a Corrected Credit Report : Issue me a corrected credit report that reflects the removal of these fraudulent accounts.

3. Acknowledge Verified Information : Accept and use the government-issued ID and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have provided to update their records, preventing further delays. 
4. Confirm Compliance in Writing : Provide written confirmation that my identity has been verified, the fraudulent accounts have been removed, and my credit report has been corrected.

5. Prevent Further Excuses : Ensure Equifax stops delaying the resolution of disputes by requiring repetitive identity verification without taking appropriate action to fix credit reports. 

Supporting Documents : I am prepared to provide the following : Copy of my government-issued ID ( e.g., drivers license or passport ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX statement as proof of address FTC Identity Theft Report IC3 Complaint Report Conclusion : Equifaxs repeated delays and excuses in resolving my credit report disputes are unacceptable and have caused undue hardship. I trust the CFPB will ensure that Equifax fulfills its legal obligations under the FCRA and resolves this matter without further delay.

Given the repeated and willful nature of these violations, I am hereby notifying you that I am escalating this matter to the office of the Attorney General of XXXX XXXX  and XXXX. I am also considering additional legal actions against your agency to seek full redress for the harm caused by your actions. 

Effective immediately, I demand that you cease all forms of communication with me and any third parties in connection with this alleged debt. This is a formal cease and desist notice under the FDCPA. Any further communication from your agency, except to confirm receipt of this letter or to provide proof of debt validation as mandated by law, will be considered a further violation and will be documented as such. 

Please be aware that I am fully prepared to take legal action if these violations continue. This letter serves as evidence that I have provided your agency with notice of your violations and of my intent to pursue legal remedies.

These actions amount to false, misleading, and deceptive practices, which infringe upon my consumer rights.

Dear Goldman Sachs Bank USA Compliance Department, I write in response to your investigation summary regarding the CFPB complaint involving the Apple Card. Your conclusion that "" no error occurred '' is unsupported, as your response does not provide verifiable proof that disclosures and billing statements were delivered in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1666b and 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ) of the Truth in Lending Act.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1666b ( a ) - Timing of Payments : "" A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. '' You mentioned that The Bank does not provide the additional documentation the Customer has requested ( such as tracking number, receipt of delivery etc. ) but this is the only information that can be used to prove if the disclosures were mailed or delivered not later than 21 days before the payment due date. 

Your response fails to provide evidence that reasonable procedures were followed to ensure the timely delivery of periodic statements. 


15 USC 1637 ( b ) mandates that creditors transmit a periodic statement to the account holder for each billing cycle in which there is an outstanding balance or finance charge. The statement must include, among other items : The outstanding balance, The minimum payment required, The due date for payment, and Any finance charges imposed during the billing cycle.

The absence of verifiable proof of timely delivery for these periodic statements directly violates the statutory requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ). 

My initial complaint requested specific evidence, such as : A tracking number, A receipt of delivery, or Other verifiable documentation confirming that disclosures and statements were delivered at least 21 days before the payment due date. 

Your response failed to provide this evidence, and instead referenced general notification practices that do not meet the statutory standard. Your response does not include details of the procedures employed to ensure compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1666b. Without such information, the Bank can not substantiate its claim that "" no error occurred. '' Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 7 ), you are required to provide a detailed explanation of the methods and evidence used in your investigation and how you used it to determine the validity of the reported late payments. These details are missing from your response.

To resolve this matter, I request the following : Verifiable evidence that billing statements were mailed or delivered at least 21 days before the payment due date, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1666b.

Include documentation such as tracking numbers, delivery confirmations, or other forms of proof.

A detailed explanation of the procedures and systems used to ensure compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1666b and 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ).

Your response must address the legal requirements raised. Any unrelated or irrelevant information will be interpreted as an attempt to evade compliance and will be noted for potential escalation.

Failure to provide the requested documentation will nullify your conclusion that "" no error occurred '' and may constitute a willful violation of 15 U.S.C. 1666b, 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ), and 15 U.S.C. 1681n. I request a complete and substantiated response within 10 business days.

Under the FDCPA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ), if a consumer disputes a debt in writing and requests verification, the collector must cease collection activities until they provide verification. Failure to validate the debt within a reasonable timeframe may require the removal of the disputed item from my credit report.

If you are not aware this entire claim is regulated by an arbitration agreement with XXXX XXXX, which clearly stipulates that any dispute must be resolved through arbitration due to the binding agreement. To date there has been no arbitration proceedings. As a direct result of that this is considered a material breach of the arbitration terms listed in the original agreement acknowledged by all involved parties. 

Furthermore, a payment was made to the original creditor on XX/XX/year> by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and proof of payment was provided, yet the negative entries related to this account remain on my credit reports for six years now. 

So in addition to the violation above, the additional violations are as follows : Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), Section 807 ( 8 ), it is unlawful for debt collectors to use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation in connection with the collection of any debt. By failing to delete the account, your agency is potentially engaging in deceptive practices. 

Under Section 808 ( 1 ) of the FDCPA, continuing to report the debt in violation of my agreement with the original creditor could be considered an unfair practice.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ), your agency is required to provide accurate information to credit reporting agencies. Your continued reporting of this debt after being notified with proof of payment that it should be deleted is not only inaccurate but also in violation of this section.

Your agency has reported inaccurate information to credit bureaus in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ). Statutory Damages : {$1000.00} 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) Prohibition Against Knowingly or Recklessly Furnishing Inaccurate Information : Your agency has knowingly or recklessly furnished inaccurate information to credit bureaus, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Statutory Damages : {$1000.00} These actions have caused significant harm to me, including damage to my credit score, and emotional distress as it relates to my ability to pursue other loans and credit opportunities. As a result, I am entitled to statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} for each violation listed above.

I am requesting immediate action to correct this matter. Please remove and delete any negative entries related to this account from all credit reporting agencies. As I confidently assert that you have no right to collect on this alleged debt.

I am writing this as I humbly seek to have this discrepancy resolved both promptly and amicably.

With that, my demands are as follows : 1. You must promptly notify any credit reporting agency to remove all information and/or tradelines associated with this account. I request a written confirmation of that communication to be sent to the address you have on file ; 2. A settlement agreement that I may retain for my records.

3. Monetary compensation in the amount of {$2000.00}.

While I do not desire or anticipate that your negligence may force me to pursue further legal action, that option will be explored. In the event that needs to happen, you are subject to a significant increase in demands to cover damages, attorney fees, and more. I am sure a company of your caliber does not look to unreasonably be exposed to those routes.

2024-12-29,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding inaccurate credit reporting by PORTFOLIO RECOV ASSOC related to my credit report. 

The account in question is being reported with a last payment date, but there is no corresponding payment history for that date. This discrepancy is misleading, and it violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Below are the details of the issue : The debt collector has reported a last payment date, but when reviewing the payment history, this date is not included as part of the documented payment history. 
The lack of accurate and consistent payment history creates a misleading or incomplete representation of my creditworthiness and is damaging to my credit score. 
As a consumer, I am entitled to accurate information on my credit report under the FCRA, which requires that all information reported to credit bureaus be complete, accurate, and verifiable. Specifically : FCRA Section 605 mandates that only accurate information can be reported to credit bureaus. 
FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) requires that furnishers of information ( in this case, the debt collector ) report accurate information, including complete payment histories. The failure to accurately report the payment history violates this section of the FCRA. 
FCRA Section 1681i entitles consumers to dispute inaccurate information and requires credit reporting agencies to investigate and correct or remove any inaccurate or unverifiable information. 
FDCPA Section 1692e prohibits debt collectors from making false representations about the status of a debt. The debt collector 's failure to include the corresponding payment history with the reported last payment date may constitute a violation of this provision. 
Requested Action : I respectfully request that the CFPB assist in ensuring that the debt collector complies with applicable consumer protection laws and that my credit report be updated to reflect the following : Deletion of the debt from my credit report due to the inaccurate and incomplete reporting of the last payment date without the corresponding payment history. The lack of verification and substantiation of this information renders the debt unverifiable under the FCRA. 
If deletion is not possible, I request that the credit reporting agencies conduct a thorough investigation and require the debt collector to provide a complete and accurate payment history, including a valid last payment date, in compliance with the FCRA. 
I have already attempted to resolve this matter directly with the debt collector, but they have failed to correct the discrepancies or provide adequate clarification regarding the inaccurate reporting. 

I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this issue and ensure my consumer rights are upheld in accordance with the FCRA and FDCPA. If this issue is not addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner, I will consider taking further legal action, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seeking remedies under the law. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance in resolving this issue.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,VA,23222,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11310499

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Alliant Credit Union used unfair collection practices to repossess my vehicle ; I have been long time member with Alliant Credit made vehicle payments on time paid more than monthly amount for 3 years recently fell on hard times. Reached out to Alliant Credit Union to discuss hardship/ deferment payment options which they have a plan that I'm billed monthly at XXXX to protect auto loan in the event I am faced with a hardship I had to "" APPLY/QUALIFY '' for this assistance ; application were submitted for 3 months and were either ignored, marked as incomplete or denied. How do you get denied for hardship assistance when there's a reduction of income. All lenders offer the ability to place payments at the end of the loan without submitting proof of income/harship we have never used this benefit/program. It my belief we qualified due to national COVID disaster assistance programs, reduction of income due to being temporarily unemployed, and vehicle was in area of XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXo we had XXXX life changing events that Allaint advertise assistance for and we were repeatedly denied. Furthermore in State of Illinois lenders are required to send letter advising consumers of intent of repossession detailing redemption process ; and allow consumer 21 days to resolve issue before action is taken if loan is paid off more than 30 %. We never received written notification and loan is paid off 50 %. The original loan taken out XX/XX/XXXX was {$49000.00}. our current balance is XXXX which includes additional fees payments. Consumer rights were violated : 15 USC 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), 15 USC 1681i, 15 USC 1681s-2, UCC 9 PART 6, UCC 9-609 ( b ) Breach of Peace, Public Disturbance. I logged into Alliant website and submitted payment of {$1500.00} which would have bought account current covering payment 2 months of payments our regular monthly payment is {$740.00} on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX was advised by Alliant customer service representative the repossession order was sent out XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX which was after payment was submitted. Once XX/XX/XXXX when vehicle was repo 'd contact representative that advised to cancel payment from day before the amount due had changed ( fees added and needed to add XX/XX/XXXX payment which posted to account XX/XX/XXXX ) the new amount due is {$3600.00} which is outrageous. The total due of account was {$2200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX when payment for {$1500.00} was submitted. Its my assumption that Alliant Credit Union practiced unlawful collection tactics to repo vehicle due to the fact we have a great interest rate of 4 % the vehicle is more than 50 % paid off and there would be equity in vehicle if resold making repossession of vehicle more profitable transaction to bank verses working it out with a longtime consumer ; there is no reason we should have been denied hardship repayment due to income that's the purpose of hardship income changes. We had to submit application and checks stubs to "" APPLY '' to use coverage program that I have been billed XXXX per month for last 3 years. Repossession was preformed without proper legal authority.

MAJOR CREDIT bureaus : I am writing to formally dispute numerous errors/ inaccurate information reflecting on my consumer credit profiles with all three major credit bureaus and to address several violations of consumer protection laws that have come to my attention.

- Failure to Provide 1099-C : I have not received a 1099-C for any canceled debts, which is necessary for accurate tax reporting. 

- Breach of Peace/Public Disturbance : The manner in which the repossession was handled caused a public disturbance and did not adhere to the legal requirement of maintaining the peace. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccurate information in my credit file. I am requesting that you conduct a thorough investigation of this matter to verify whether the creditor has reported this debt accurately and whether they have fulfilled their obligation to issue a 1099-C. If they are unable to provide proof of the cancellation of debt and the corresponding 1099-C, I request that you remove this entry from my credit report. 

First, I would like to remind you that under the FDCPA, a creditor must provide proper notification before taking action such as repossession. I did not receive any written notice concerning a default or an impending repossession within the time frame required by law. Specifically, in Illinois where vehicle is registered lender is required to send written notice of default and repossession intent informing borrower of intent to recover vehicle provide instruction of remedy of default ; notice also allows borrower 21 days to bring loan current if vehicle is more than 30 % paid off. 

Additionally, I would like to request that you provide me with documentation proving your right to repossess the vehicle, including the original loan agreement and any correspondence related to the default. According to the law, I have the right to receive this information, and failure to provide it may constitute additional violations of our rights as a consumer.

I spent XXXX hours at the dealership trying to get approved for a car loan. 

Description of the issue : I was interested in purchasing a XXXX XXXX XXXX priced around {$17000.00}. I had a XXXX XXXX XXXX, but the dealership claimed that my credit history wasnt sufficient and that, as a XXXX XXXX, I didnt make enough income to qualify for the loan on my own. To help with the approval, they added my sisters income to the loan application. 

The process and misleading information : The dealership initially told me I could drive off with just {$500.00} down, but this amount kept increasing. By the end of the day, they pressured me into putting {$1000.00} downa sum that was difficult for me to afford. I was continuously pressured by the salespeople to accept the loan, even though I didnt fully understand the terms. 

I did not understand the interest rate or how it would affect the overall cost of the loan. As a naive buyer, I grew up in a low-income household and had no experience with loans, so I trusted the dealerships assurances. In the end, I signed a loan agreement through Santander Consumer with an interest rate of 24.10 % on a XXXX loan, with XXXX XXXX monthly payments. 

Loan details and ongoing financial burden : I purchased the XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX miles on it. The current payoff amount as of now is {$15000.00}, and I wont be done paying off the loan until XX/XX/XXXX. I feel like I was taken advantage of because I didnt understand the loan terms, and the interest rate is much higher than it should have been for someone with my credit score. According to my research, the average interest rate for someone with a XXXX XXXX XXXX should have been closer to XXXX %. Instead, I was stuck with an interest rate that is more than XXXX times the average rate. 

Quality and condition of the vehicle : The XXXX XXXX XXXX I purchased is already showing signs of wear, and Im concerned that the car wont even last until the end of the loan term in XXXX. I feel trapped in this loan, paying far more than I should for a used vehicle that wont retain its value. 

How I was treated by the dealership : I felt pressured and misled throughout the entire process. The dealership didnt take my financial situation into account and pushed me into accepting terms that werent in my best interest. I also feel that my lack of experience as a XXXX XXXXXXXX made me an easy target for this type of deal.",,"SANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.",TX,78705,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11309445

2024-12-29,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Repossession,Damage caused or loss of personal items in vehicle during the actual repossession,"Santander repossessed my car last year and returned it after I paid all of the past due balance ( and the penalty fees they never retracted as promised ). The car was damaged as the transmission blew apart before I even got it home. My mechanic determined it was towed in gear when repossessed. A new transmission is {$6000.00}. I continued to pay my payments even though the car sits in my driveway unusable as I pay {$450.00} per week for alternative rides to work. Finally as of a few months ago, the expense for rides has taking its toll, and I struggle to pay my loan with Santander threatening to repossess my car yet again. Santander had given no indication on what their liability would be or their contracted tow companys liability would be from when they damaged it. The car is not driveable, however, they still expect their payments somehow and threaten to repossess it again, which would absorb all the investment I have in this car and ruin my credit even more. I have reported this over and over to no response so I reported it to federal consumer finance protection. 

I was then contacted by Santander and spoke to a senior account manager executive. I reiterated what happened and explained that when I looked into the warranty for the car, I learned that XXXX was considering a recall on the transmission for my cars year and explained that maybe that had something to do with its susceptibility to the towing error when getting repossessed. I explained that XXXX decided against the recall and had instead added the part to a customer satisfaction policy that pays for the entire transmission should it fail if purchased new from a dealership. I explained I did not appear to be a candidate, because even though it was purchased from a dealership with their loan, it was purchased as a used car. He said he had the autonomy to look into getting my car repaired as they provide many loans to this dealership and I can avoid another repossession IF I MADE A PAYMENT AND WITHDREW MY REPORT FROM THE CFPB. He said UNLESS I do those two things, he wont have a dialogue about what they can do to solve the problem. I logged on to withdrawal the complaint when I saw the case was closed already and that they are not going to take any responsibility for the damage done on the tow during the repossession when their company towed it in gear and destroyed the transmission. They said I never reported the damage in a timely fashion. This isnt true because I told them and their tow company when it happened and multiple times since. I have around {$12000.00} paid into this car and owe like {$18000.00} on a {$23000.00} sticker purchase because of the crazy interest rate. The car only has XXXX mi on it with a blown transmission, around XXXX  miles past the warranty expiration. 

So my complaint to the CFPB was closed arbitrarily as Im confused to what it has even done to protect me. I reopen this complaint with the above new information and ask for help on how I can get my car repaired. 

Finally, for Santander to hold any corrective action ransom based on me withdrawing a complaint from the CFPB is not acceptable. Nor is CFPB closing a complaint to basically endorse this blackmail acceptable.

I used my Chase credit card for this purchase. 

After a few days, the order was marked as delivered but it had not arrived. Because of this, we disputed the associated charge ( Chase transaction reference ID # XXXX ). Chase credited us the transaction amount, as is customary while an ongoing dispute is pending. 

Eventually, after a few more days the order did arrive. Because it arrived, I cancelled the charge dispute with Chase. Chase rebilled the charge to the credit card. 

Upon receiving the item, we eventually decided to return the item to the merchant. This return was accepted by the merchant, and they confirmed they received the item back ( correspondence attached below ). They confirmed multiple times that the refund was processed and funds were released to our method of payment. They confirmed the refund was processed on XXXX XX/XX/year>, at XXXX XXXX However, its been over 2 months now and we have not received the refund in our account with Chase. Chase claims they have not received any refund, and they have used many different reasons as to why we can not dispute this charge, or get refunded, while they investigate the refund process. 

Chase keeps closing my disputes and inquiries for varying and invalid reasons. I have called the Chase customer service many times and spent hours on the phone with them to no avail. 

Thus, we have returned an item and Chase refuses to process the return. We have lost {$690.00} to no fault of our own and no one will help us. 

I have included attachments to show multiple confirmations from the merchant that the funds have been released, as well as our credit card statements for every month since the original purchase, to prove that we have not been refunded.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,VA,22203,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11310827

I believe their process is misleading, potentially predatory, and results in financial harm to consumers. Below are the specific issues I have encountered : XXXX. **Misrepresentation of XXXX Options : ** - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX options for check cashing : - "" XXXX  XXXX  XXXX '' for a fee. 
- "" XXXX processing '' for free. 
- It was my understanding that if a check did not qualify for "" XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, '' it would default to the XXXX processing option to allow for verification of funds. However, this fallback does not appear to be implemented in practice, leaving customers with no recourse if their check is denied for "" XXXX in XXXX. '' XXXX. **Technical Issues Preventing Service Access : ** - On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to cash a check for {$XXXX} through the XXXX XXXX. Due to updates on XXXX platform, I was unable to complete the transaction. 
- This issue affects XXXX users, who currently can not see the check cashing option at all. As of this submission, the issue remains unresolved, effectively blocking access to a core feature of the service. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX Process : ** - To troubleshoot the issue, I took a photo of the check and attempted to process it. This action triggered a hold on my account. 
- XXXX XXXX verification process appears superficial, relying on physical characteristics of the check ( e.g., security paper ) rather than contacting the issuing bank to confirm the validity of the check and guarantee of funds. This lack of thorough verification imposes unnecessary holds on legitimate checks. 

XXXX. **Predatory "" VOID '' Instruction : ** - Numerous customers, including myself, have reported a troubling practice : - XXXX XXXX approves checks and instructs customers to write "" VOID '' on the physical check. 
- After the customer complies, XXXX denies the transaction without further review of the check. 
- The check, now marked "" VOID, '' can not be deposited elsewhere, leaving customers unable to access their funds. 

XXXX. **Excessive Fees : ** - For successful transactions, XXXX charges high fees. For example : - I cashed a check for {$XXXX} and was charged over {$XXXX} in fees. 
- These fees, equating to roughly XXXX  %, are excessive and resemble high-interest loans, especially when applied to cashiers checks or other guaranteed funds. 
- This practice appears predatory, targeting consumers who XXXX lack alternative options for immediate cash access. 

6. **Specific Incident Details : ** - The check I attempted to cash on XX/XX/XXXX was a cashiers check issued by XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX a guaranteed form of payment. Despite this, I encountered a hold and unclear verification procedures. 

**Impact on XXXX : ** XXXX XXXX practices : - Mislead consumers about available options for processing checks. 
- XXXX excessive fees for expedited service, resembling predatory lending. 
- Leave customers worse off by denying checks after instructing them to write "" VOID. '' - Fail to provide equal access to services for Android users, undermining the reliability of their platform. 

I believe these practices violate consumer protection principles and XXXX constitute unfair or deceptive practices under federal law.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"I am submitting this complaint against TransUnion regarding fraudulent collections added to my credit report, my inability to effectively dispute them, and poor customer service that has worsened the situation. Time is critical, as I have a limited window to dispute the validity of these collections. Below are the key issues : 1.Fraudulent Collections Discovered on My Credit Report : Two fraudulent collections attributed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have appeared on my credit report. The first reports a balance of {$1000.00}, and the second reports a balance of {$870.00}. Both were added on XX/XX/year>. These accounts are fraudulent and the result of identity theft. I was only able to learn of these collections through XXXX XXXX because I have been unable to access my TransUnion credit report. 
XXXX.Inability to Access Credit Report Since XX/XX/year> : Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been unable to view my credit report through TransUnion despite repeated attempts. This lack of access prevents me from verifying additional changes to my report or confirming whether disputes I filed have been processed. 
XXXXDispute Portal Malfunction : I currently have an open dispute with TransUnion, but I can not view its status or progress due to repeated errors in the dispute system. This has left me without a reliable way to address or escalate the fraudulent collections in a timely manner. 
XXXX.Conflicting Information and Poor Customer Service XXXX The agents I have spoken with have provided conflicting and unhelpful information. For example : One agent stated that my credit report is only updated weekly, which contradicts TransUnions claims of real-time reporting. 
Another agent discouraged me from mentioning my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) statutes, which I found both unprofessional and dismissive of my rights as a consumer. 
Some agents displayed unhelpful and rude attitudes during our interactions. Screenshots of these interactions are attached as evidence. 

Impact on Me : The combination of fraudulent collections, inaccessible tools, and poor customer service has left me unable to protect my credit profile or resolve issues caused by identity theft. I am at risk of long-term financial harm if these fraudulent collections are not removed promptly. The conflicting information provided by TransUnion agents has further delayed resolution and caused unnecessary stress.",,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",AZ,86406,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11310551

This reporting is misleading and inconsistent with the legal definition of a charged-off debt.

I filed a prior complaint ( XXXX ) with the CFPB about similar issues, but the investigation appears to have been incomplete. USAA continues to report inaccurate information, despite my requests for correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Actions I have taken : Contacted USAA directly to dispute the accounts inaccurate status, including their refusal to issue a Form 1099-C.

Filed a previous complaint with the CFPB regarding this account.

Actions taken by USAA : Refused to issue a Form 1099-C while still reporting the debt as charged off.

Continued to report an unpaid balance and delinquent status on my credit report.

This inaccurate reporting has significantly harmed my credit and financial standing, and I believe it violates both FCRA accuracy standards and 26 U.S. Code 6050P, which governs the reporting of canceled debts.

XX/XX/XXXX : Another fraudulent charge from XXXX XXXX was made on my credit card ( {$99.00} ). Updated all passwords, etc. again. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I filed a new fraud dispute with Bank of America totaling {$250.00} for the charges made by XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. My credit card was cancelled again, a new cc was issued, and I was told that a block was put on all merchants. 

XX/XX/XXXX : A new fraudulent charge was made on my card from XXXX ( {$71.00} ). I filed ANOTHER fraud dispute with Bank of America. My credit card was canceled AGAIN, and a new card was issued. 

XX/XX/XXXX : a new fraudulent charge was made again on my card from XXXX XXXX ( {$99.00} ). 

It was at this point that I became aware that these are all subscription services and I was now stuck in a subscription trap, and made every attempt to contact the companies to cancel the subscriptions. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I made contact via email with XXXX XXXX and an account made in my name was located and canceled. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I made contact with XXXX XXXX via text, and they were able to locate the fraudulent account under the email address XXXX which is not my email. They confirmed cancellation of the account. 

XX/XX/XXXX : A Billing Dispute was created with Bank of America against XXXX XXXX ( {$99.00} ) for charges made on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was very upset, angry, and at a loss of what to do with all of the repeated charges on my card. It was suggested by the Bank of America rep, that this time I file a "" Billing Dispute '' instead of a fraud claim so that I didn't have to cancel my credit card again. I agreed, even though he didn't fully explain the difference between a billing dispute and a fraud claim. He said my only other option was to cancel my account completely and sign up for a new credit card with new terms. I was livid that this was his suggestion, and refused it. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Another fraudulent, recurring charge was made by XXXX XXXX ( {$100.00} ). 

XX/XX/XXXX : I filed a new fraud dispute with Bank of America, my credit card was canceled, and a new cc was issued with expedited delivery. I was assured by the BOA rep that it wouldn't happen again. I contacted XXXX XXXX, and was told that there is no account in my name, so they were not able to locate it.

2024-12-29,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Summary : I am being contacted by a debt collection agency regarding a credit card account and charge that has been deemed fraudulent by the issuing credit card company. The issuing credit card company sold that account even though they have provided in writing XXXX that I am not responsible for the charges and now I am dealing with a debt collection agency. Something inappropriate is happening here and needs to be investigated. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and on it there was a transaction for {$490.00}. I do not have an XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX and I did not make that transaction. I immediately took the following steps : I reported identify theft to the FTC - XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX I froze my credit I open disputes with the credit bureaus I called the credit card issuing bank which is XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX 

Speaking with the fraud depart of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I opened a fraud case XXXX  XXXX. I was told to call back in XXXX weeks. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called back and was told they need more time to complete the investigation. Some time in XXXX I receive a phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX  asking me when I plan to pay my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I explained to the fraudulent situation and was transferred to the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. After explaining again that the card was NOT opened by me and the charge was NOT mine, the fraud representative said they will follow up on my case. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a letter from XXXX XXXX Bank that after their thorough investigation of my claim, they have concluded that I am not responsible for the disputed balance amount on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In addition they have submitted a request to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to remove this account from my credit bureau report; signed the XXXX  XXXX XXXX. On the same day of receiving this letter, I wrote a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX  to please forward proof that this fraudulent account has been closed. Instead of receiving proof of the account closed, I received copies of the XX/XX/XXXX letter on XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX. 

At this point everything seemed to be completed appropriately until XX/XX/XXXX. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX  - from their XXXX XXXX informing me the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card account was closed, charged off and sold to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX, spoke to someone named XXXX XXXX about how the account was fraudulent, how I have documentation stating I am not responsible for the charges and was assured the issue will be looked into. 

Since XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX has called, sent letters and even provided copies of XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that were never delivered to my address. The debt collection agency claims I now owe {$710.00} and if I want to dispute this debt I can write them about it. 

Here is the problem with entire scenario. Not only is my time valuable, the charge was determined by XXXX XXXX XXXX  to not be my responsibility and yet now I am in a position, where I am responsible for defending myself to a debt collector when they shouldn't have access to the account in the first place. There is something inappropriate happening here. XXXX XXXX is completely incompetent or perhaps they are selling fake overdue accounts. Another possible scenario is the collection agency is working to collect on known resolved accounts and are trying to swindle money from me that I do not owe.

I believe they obtained my credit information from my state XXXX claim or state workers compensation claim. Either way, Fresh Start preyed on me when I was vulnerable, but I recovered now, and I see ways they continue to preditorily leave negative remarks on my credit that are hindering my growth, career, and integrity as a consumer. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX began mailing me letters asking me to contact them to find out how they could assist me as professional financial consultants that could to help me make XXXX monthly payment to an escrow account and theyd make regular monthly payments to my creditors while I recovered. They asked if I had hardships I experienced an injury and divorce and sold this as a good idea to help me stress less about bills and focus on recovering and getting back to work. A man named XXXX XXXX called me and went over my accounts, enrolled store accounts XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. He said XXXX be happy to know I was responsible and anytime they called me I could let them know I had support. XXXX XXXX asked me to sign a note and mail it back to them.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Old information reappears or never goes away,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the repeated failure of TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX to properly investigate and validate disputed information on my credit report, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), codified at 15 U.S.C. 1681. Despite my numerous disputes and lawful requests for validation and verification, the credit reporting agencies have failed to provide evidence substantiating their claims and continue to report inaccurate and unverified information. 

To summarize : 1.Failure to Provide Proper Validation : I requested the following documents to validate the alleged debts : Validation of the debt ( including actual accounting ) ; Verification of the claim against me ( such as a sworn affidavit or a hand-signed invoice compliant with the Bills of Exchange Act, XXXX ) ; A true and certified copy of the original contract or agreement binding both parties ; A certified copy of the original note ( credit agreement ) under penalty of perjury, confirming it has not been sold ; Confirmation of the identity of the authorized representative who performed due diligence under the Money Laundering Regulations XXXX. 
These lawful requests were ignored or inadequately addressed. Instead, I received generic responses claiming the information was verified, without any substantive evidence to support these claims. 
2.Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable investigation when disputes are raised. Merely stating that the information was verified without providing evidence or details of the investigation constitutes a failure to meet this legal standard. 
3.Reappearance of Removed Items : Items previously removed from my credit report have inexplicably reappeared, raising serious concerns about the integrity of the investigation process and adherence to proper procedures. 
4.Failure to Respond in Good Faith : My repeated attempts to dispute these inaccuracies were met with dismissive responses warning me not to send further disputes. This is both inappropriate and contrary to consumer protection laws under the FCRA. 

Given the severity of these issues, I am requesting immediate action to : 1.Conduct a thorough, independent investigation into the practices of TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX in handling my disputes ; 2.Ensure compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i by requiring the credit reporting agencies to provide documented proof of their investigations and validations ; 3.Remove any and all unverifiable and inaccurate items from my credit reports ; 4.Impose penalties or corrective actions against the credit reporting agencies for non-compliance with FCRA standards.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,30327,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11310437

Description of the Issue : 1. Balance Discrepancy : The reported balance of {$23000.00} does not align with my records and appears inaccurate.

2. Payment History Issue : The reported payment history contains inconsistencies and does not reflect the actual status of my account.

3. Account Status Discrepancy : The status indicates Deferred payments begin XX/XX/year>, yet there are conflicting records showing ongoing account activity. 

Actions Taken : On XX/XX/year>, I sent a dispute letter directly to the Department of Education/XXXX requesting validation and correction of these discrepancies under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA, Section 611, 15 U.S.C. 1681i ).

Despite submitting this request over 30 days ago, I have not received a response, validation of the debt, or any resolution to this issue. 
I have also contacted other consumer reporting agencies to address these inaccuracies, but no verification or resolution has been provided. 
Requested Resolution : Under the FCRA, I am requesting : 1. A thorough investigation into the accuracy of this account.

2. Documentation validating the accuracy of the reported balance, payment history, and account status.

3. Immediate correction or removal of inaccurate information from my credit report if it can not be verified.

XXXX Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Unverified Accounts and Consumer Rights Violations by TransUnion Dear Sir/Madam, I am filing this formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regarding TransUnion 's ongoing verification of inaccurate and unverifiable accounts on my credit report. These incorrect entries have caused significant harm to my credit score and have violated my rights as a consumer under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), and other related consumer protection laws. 

Despite my efforts to dispute these inaccuracies directly with TransUnion, these unverifiable accounts have continued to appear as "" verified '' and remain on my credit report. It is evident that TransUnion has failed to investigate the accuracy of these accounts properly and allowed collection agencies to report unverifiable debt. This failure constitutes a clear violation of my rights and is damaging to my credit profile. 

Details of the Violation I have disputed multiple entries on my credit report with TransUnion. However, in several instances, these entries were marked as "" verified '' without providing any substantive proof or documentation from the collection agencies to validate the reported debts. This lack of verification and substantiation violates the obligations set forth by the FCRA, and the actions of TransUnion undermine my ability to maintain a fair and accurate credit report. 

Consumer Rights Violated The actions of TransUnion and the collection agencies reporting unverifiable accounts directly violate several consumer rights under federal law : 1. Failure to Verify Information ( FCRA Section 1681i ) The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies must investigate disputed information within 30 days. If the information can not be verified, it must be removed from the credit report. TransUnion 's failure to properly verify these accounts is a direct violation of this requirement.

2. Inaccurate Credit Reporting ( FCRA Section 1681e ( b ) ) The law requires that credit reports be maintained with accurate information. By verifying and reporting unverifiable accounts, TransUnion is in violation of this provision, which has resulted in substantial harm to my credit standing.

3. Failure to Provide Adequate Notice of Negative Information ( FCRA Section 1681c ) TransUnion is required to notify me of any negative information added to my report, but they have failed to provide adequate proof of validation for the disputed accounts, which remain on my report without proper substantiation.

4. Unlawful Debt Collection Practices ( FDCPA ) The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from reporting unverified or unverifiable debts to credit reporting agencies. By allowing collection agencies to report unverifiable accounts, TransUnion is enabling illegal debt collection practices.

Consumer Rights and Legal Protections Under the FCRA and FDCPA, I am entitled to the following rights : Right to Dispute Information ( FCRA Section 1681i ) : I am entitled to dispute inaccurate or unverifiable information on my credit report. TransUnion is required to investigate the dispute and remove any unverifiable accounts within the legally mandated time frame.

Right to Request Documentation ( FCRA Section 1681e ( b ) ) : If an account is verified, I have the right to request detailed documentation, including proof of debt validation from the collection agency reporting the information.

Right to Seek Legal Action : If these rights are violated, I am entitled to pursue legal remedies under both the FCRA and FDCPA, including seeking statutory and actual damages for the harm caused by the inaccuracies.

Requested Resolution I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and intervene to ensure that TransUnion upholds its legal responsibilities under the FCRA and FDCPA. I seek the following resolution : 1. Immediate removal of all unverifiable accounts from my credit report.

2. A full investigation and deletion of these inaccuracies by removing accounts that violate any of my rights as a consumer by any and all laws created and enforsed for the consumer.

3 u. Confirmation from TransUnion that it will take steps to ensure compliance with consumer protection laws.

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will seek further legal remedies, including filing a lawsuit under the FCRA and FDCPA, and will continue to pursue complaints through all available channels.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that the CFPB will take the necessary steps to address these violations and help resolve this situation fairly and swiftly. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Laws Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The FCRA outlines the following key provisions ( not exhaustive ) : Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) : The consumer has the right to obtain all information in their credit file.

Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) : If disputed, consumer reporting agencies must investigate any inaccuracies within 30 days.

Section 605 ( a ) : Consumer reporting agencies can not report negative information older than seven years or bankruptcies older than ten years.

Section 623 ( a ) : Furnishers of information ( creditors ) must provide accurate information to credit bureaus.

Section 605B : Victims of identity theft can request that fraudulent accounts be blocked. 


2. California Consumer Laws : California Civil Code 1785.25 ( a ) : It is unlawful for a person to furnish information to a credit reporting agency if they know or should know the information is inaccurate. 

California Civil Code 1785.16 : Consumers have the right to dispute errors, and credit bureaus must investigate disputes. 


3. Steps to Analyze Negative Accounts : For each negative account, I will : 1. List the account details.

2. Determine which FCRA and California laws are potentially violated.

3. Highlight any data that suggests non-compliance ( e.g., inaccuracies, outdated information, missing investigation after disputes ).

To analyze my report for violations of California Consumer Law and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have broken down the inaccurate or unverifiable accounts with adverse information and cross-reference their reported details with the relevant laws. Here 's the organized data : Inaccurate Accounts and Violations XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : {$260.00} Past Due : {$260.00} Remarks : "" Account information disputed by consumer ( FCRA ) ; Placed for Collection '' Removal Date : XX/XX/XXXX Potential Violations : FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) : Failure to verify the accuracy of information following a dispute by the consumer.

Check if the listed removal dates for negative accounts comply with the 7-year limit ( 10 years for bankruptcies ). 



Yes, my credit report shows instances of duplicate reporting, where the same account or debt is being reported by multiple entities. This typically occurs when an original creditor sells a debt to a collection agency, and both the original account and the collection account are listed on the report. Duplicate reporting can unfairly impact credit score. 

Heres an example from my report : Duplicate XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : {$260.00} Past Due : {$260.00} Remarks : "" Placed for Collection '' XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Balance : {$220.00} Pay Status : "" Sold ; was Charged-off '' Remarks : "" Purchased by another lender ; Paid in full/was a charge-off '' Potential Violations : FCRA Section 605 ( a ) : Reporting the same debt multiple times under different I Demand that both the original account and the collection account be removed imediately they both participated Laws where violated. As a result I've been denied credit at times when I needed it most. 





I identified instances of incomplete or inaccurate information about payments in this credit report. I listed details of these accounts and highlighted a few violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and California Consumer Credit Reporting Laws. 


Incomplete or Inaccurate Payment Reporting XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Pay Status : >Charge-off< Remarks : Payment history shows multiple months without reported payments, despite the account status. 

Balance : {$390.00} Date Closed : XX/XX/XXXX Potential Issues : Payment history lacks continuity ( e.g., no data for several months ). 

If payments were made but not reported, this violates FCRA Section 623 ( a ) : Furnishers must provide accurate and complete information. 



XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Original Creditor : Automobile Club Balance : {$180.00} Remarks : "" Account information disputed by consumer ( FCRA ) ; Placed for Collection '' Past Due : {$180.00} Potential Issues : Disputed but still unresolved or not marked as "" investigated.

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : {$260.00} Past Due : {$260.00} Remarks : "" Placed for Collection '' Potential Issues : If the account was disputed, it should show an update reflecting the dispute investigation 's outcome, as required by FCRA Section 623 ( b ).

This account is reported on the same report by two different agencies! 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Pay Status : "" Sold ; was Charged-off '' Remarks : "" Purchased by another lender ; Paid in full/was a charge-off '' Balance : {$0.00} ( indicating it may have been paid off ). 


Potential Issues : Payment information is incomplete ( e.g., no record of payments leading to the "" paid in full '' status ). 

Violates FCRA Section 623 ( a ) and California Civil Code 1785.25 ( a ) if payments were made but not reported. 






Yes, there are accounts on my credit report where the start dates ( date the account was opened ) are either missing or unclear. Accurate start dates are essential for determining the age of the account, which impacts credit scoring and compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and California Consumer Credit Reporting Laws.

Accounts Missing Start Dates or Showing Incomplete Information XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Original Creditor : Automobile Club Balance : {$180.00} This Balance amount does not reflect that of any of my records whatsoever but is coming back as verified and accurate. 
This strongly suggest that transunion is guilty of breaking laws. 
Could it be a conspiracy? 
Is it legal for two different agencies to report the same account on the same credit report? 
Is it legal for a collection agency to report an unverifiable account beyond the statute of limitations? 
Is it legal to report an account that does not have a start date? 
Is it legal for an a credit reporting agency to investigate a consumer 's dispute and conclude the avvount as verified and accurate whenever the account is unverifiable? 
And on and on it goes .... 

Missing Start Date : The report does not include the date the account was opened, only the date it was placed in collections ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 



XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Original Creditor : Progressive Insurance Balance : {$130.00} Remarks : "" Placed for Collection '' Missing Start Date : The report lacks the date when the original account was opened, only showing the collection placement date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 



XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : {$260.00} Remarks : "" Placed for Collection '' Incomplete Start Date : While the account shows a collection entry date, the original opening date with XXXX is not specified. 



XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Balance : {$0.00} ( sold or paid ) Remarks : "" Purchased by another lender '' Missing Start Date : The original date this account was opened is not listed, only its transfer/sale date. 


Relevant Laws Being Violated 1. FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) : "" Every consumer reporting agency shall, upon request, clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer all information in the consumer 's file at the time of the request, including the sources of the information. '' 2. FCRA Section 623 ( a ) : "" Furnishers of information must report complete and accurate information to consumer reporting agencies. '' 3. California Civil Code 1785.25 ( a ) : "" A person shall not furnish information on a specific transaction or experience to any consumer credit reporting agency if the person knows or should know the information is incomplete or inaccurate. '' Why This Matters Missing start dates make it difficult to verify the validity of the account, including whether it is within the 7-year reporting limit for negative items under FCRA Section 605 ( a ).

Incomplete data can negatively impact my credit score and make it harder to dispute inaccurate or outdated entries. 



Based on the information provided in my credit report, it appears that several accounts are marked as "" disputed by the consumer '' under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), but there is no clear evidence that these disputes were thoroughly investigated or resolved. This lack of resolution may constitute violations of the FCRA. 


Accounts Marked as Disputed XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Remarks : "" Account information disputed by consumer ( FCRA ) ; Placed for Collection '' Potential Issue : There is no indication that the dispute was resolved or that the account status was updated following an investigation. 



XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Remarks : "" Account information disputed by consumer ( FCRA ) ; Placed for Collection '' Potential Issue : The account remains in collection status without evidence of investigation or resolution of the dispute. 



XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account ending in XXXX ) Details : Remarks : "" Account information disputed by consumer ( FCRA ) ; Placed for Collection '' Potential Issue : The status remains unchanged, suggesting the dispute may not have been investigated or resolved.

Relevant FCRA Laws 1. FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) : "" If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, the agency shall reinvestigate free of charge and record the current status of the disputed information or delete the item within 30 days. '' 2. FCRA Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) : "" After receiving notice of a dispute with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information provided to a consumer reporting agency, the furnisher of information shall : Conduct an investigation with respect to the disputed information ; Review all relevant information provided by the consumer reporting agency ; Report the results of the investigation to the consumer reporting agency. '' 3. California Civil Code 1785.16 ( a ) : "" If the consumer credit reporting agency determines the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, it shall notify the consumer, and upon request by the consumer, reinvestigate the matter. '' Signs of Non-Compliance 1. No Evidence of Investigation : Accounts remain marked as disputed but show no changes to their status, suggesting that no investigation was conducted within the required 30-day period. 


XXXX. No Updates After Disputes : Even after the I disputed the accuracy of these accounts, there are no updated remarks indicating the results of investigations or validations from the furnisher of information.

3. Failure to Communicate Results : There is no evidence that I was notified of the investigation results or provided with any updated information.

If the collection accounts listed on my credit report do not match my records and Im unable to verify the agencies, balances, or past-due amounts, this may violate my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and California Consumer Credit Reporting Laws . Heres why : Potential Violations of my Rights 1. FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) : Right to Accurate Information Ihave the right to request complete and accurate information about every account reported, including : The name of the creditor or collection agency. 

The original balance, amount owed, and payment history. 

The date the account was opened and placed for collection. 


If the information provided on my credit report is incomplete, inaccurate, or unverifiable, it violates my rights under the FCRA. 

2. FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) : Right to Dispute Inaccuracies If the collection accounts do not match my records, I have the right to dispute the accuracy of the information. The credit bureau and collection agency must : Investigate within 30 days of receiving your dispute.

Provide verification of the debt, including the original creditor and all supporting documentation.

Delete the information if it can not be verified.

Failure to investigate or resolve a dispute violates the FCRA.

3. FCRA Section 623 ( a ) : Responsibilities of Information Furnishers Furnishers ( e.g., collection agencies ) are required to : Report accurate and complete information.

Investigate and correct disputed accounts promptly.

If the balances, past-due amounts, or creditor names are incorrect, it could violate this section.

4. California Civil Code 1785.25 ( a ) : "" No person shall furnish information to a consumer credit reporting agency if they know or should know the information is inaccurate. '' If the collection agencies reported inaccurate or unverifiable information, they could be in violation of California law.

5. California Civil Code 1785.16 : Credit reporting agencies must : Investigate disputes within 30 days.

delete unverifiable or inaccurate information.

What This Means for me If the information on the collection accounts ( e.g., agency names, balances, dates, and past-due amounts ) can not be verified or does not match my records, those accounts should be removed from my credit report. Reporting unverifiable or inaccurate information harms my credit and violates my consumer rights.

Based on the details in my credit report, it appears that the collection accounts may be unverifiable for the following reasons : Issues with Verifiability in Collection Accounts XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Original Creditor : Automobile Club Balance : {$180.00} Remarks : "" Account information disputed by consumer ( FCRA ) ; Placed for Collection '' Potential Verifiability Issues : The original creditor 's information is vague and may not provide sufficient details about the origin of the debt. 

Theres no supporting documentation ( e.g., account statements, contracts ) showing that I owe this amount. 



XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account ending in XXXX ) Original Creditor : Progressive Insurance Balance : {$130.00} Remarks : "" Account information disputed by consumer ( FCRA ) ; Placed for Collection '' Potential Verifiability Issues : Dispute status remains unresolved, and the agency hasnt provided evidence to validate the debt. 

Missing details on the original account ( e.g., date of delinquency, itemized charges ). 



XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account ending in XXXX ) Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : {$260.00} Remarks : "" Placed for Collection '' Potential Verifiability Issues : No documentation proving the debt was properly assigned or sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Original balance details and payment history are unclear. 



XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account ending in XXXX ) Pay Status : "" Sold ; was Charged-off '' Balance : {$0.00} Remarks : "" Purchased by another lender ; Paid in full/was a charge-off '' Potential Verifiability Issues : Duplicate reporting with XXXX XXXX XXXX suggests conflicting information. 

No proof showing the account transfer or resolution status. 



Indicators of Unverifiable Accounts 1. No Supporting Documentation : Collection agencies must provide clear documentation, such as contracts, account statements, or payment histories, to verify the debt. None of these details are present in my report.

2. Disputes Unresolved : If I have disputed these accounts and the agencies have not responded with adequate validation, they are unverifiable under the FCRA.

3. Conflicting or Missing Details : Original creditor names are unclear or vague. 

Balances and dates do not match my records.

Legal Framework for Verification 1. FCRA Section 611 ( a ) : Consumers Right to Dispute The credit bureau must investigate disputes within 30 days and remove unverifiable information. 



2. FCRA Section 623 ( b ) : Responsibilities of Furnishers Collection agencies must investigate disputes and provide validation to the credit bureau.

3. California Civil Code 1785.25 ( a ) Creditors or agencies can not knowingly report inaccurate or incomplete information.

Key Violations When an Account Is Wrongly Verified as Accurate 1. FCRA Section 611 ( a ) : Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation TransUnion is required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed accounts within 30 days of receiving a dispute. 

If the account is wrongly verified as accurate, it indicates that : TransUnion failed to obtain sufficient evidence from the furnisher or creditor. 

They relied solely on the creditor 's response without validating the accuracy of the records. 



2. FCRA Section 623 ( b ) : Furnisher 's Failure to Properly Investigate Furnishers of information ( e.g., collection agencies or creditors ) must : Investigate disputes forwarded by the credit bureau.

delete, or verify the information based on an actual review of their records.

If the furnisher does not provide proper documentation to verify the debt but still reports it as accurate, it violates this section.

3. FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) : Failure to Provide Complete and Accurate Records If TransUnion fails to provide me with the supporting documentation or the original records upon request, this is a violation. 

Verified accounts must be substantiated with legitimate records ( e.g., contracts, statements, or proof of the debt ). 


4. California Civil Code 1785.16 : Duty to Delete Inaccurate Information California law requires credit reporting agencies to delete inaccurate or unverifiable information after a dispute.

If TransUnion verifies inaccurate accounts without proper documentation, it violates this law.

5. California Civil Code 1785.25 ( a ) : Reporting Incomplete or Inaccurate Information Furnishers ( e.g., collection agencies ) must not report incomplete or inaccurate information to credit bureaus.

If TransUnion relies on inaccurate information provided by the furnisher and verifies it, this creates liability for both TransUnion and the furnisher.

6. FCRA Section 605 ( a ) : Reporting Obsolete Information If the account includes outdated information ( e.g., a delinquency older than 7 years ), verifying it as accurate violates this section.

Why This Is Problematic Burden of Proof : The credit bureau can not simply accept the creditor 's response as verification. They must ensure the information is accurate and complete through independent analysis. 

Lack of Transparency : If they fail to provide documentation to back their verification, it indicates a failure to comply with FCRA and California law. 



Under FCRA Section 616 and 617, I may be entitled to damages for willful or negligent noncompliance. This includes statutory damages, actual damages, and legal fees.

Despite my repeated efforts to obtain clarification and resolution directly from TransUnion, I have been unable to identify any legitimate reason for these changes, leaving me deeply frustrated and concerned. 

I have purchased my credit reports and scores from TransUnion and other major credit reporting agencies. However, there is no data or activity in these reports that would justify the declines. When I contacted TransUnion, their representatives could only provide generic information about the overall factors contributing to a credit score but failedor refusedto give specific explanations for the changes to my score during the months in question.

This lack of transparency has caused significant distress and has left me feeling powerless in protecting my financial health. A credit score is a critical aspect of my financial stability, and unexplained declines not only damage my credibility but also limit my ability to pursue financial opportunities. I am seeking your assistance to : 1. Investigate the unexplained declines in my credit score over the last three months.

2. Advocate for a clear and specific explanation from TransUnion regarding the factors that led to these changes.

3. Ensure that the credit reporting agency adheres to its legal obligations for transparency and accuracy under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

I am enclosing copies of my credit reports from TransUnion and other agencies, as well as records of my communication with TransUnion representatives. I am hopeful that your intervention will help resolve this matter in a timely and fair manner.

Thank you for your attention to this issue. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the next steps in this process. Should you need any additional information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

2024-12-29,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Summary : I am being contacted by a debt collection agency regarding a credit card account and charge that has been deemed fraudulent by the issuing credit card company. The issuing credit card company sold that account even though they have provided in writing 3x that I am not responsible for the charges and now I am dealing with a debt collection agency. Something inappropriate is happening here and needs to be investigated. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an Ulta Beauty Rewards Mastercard Credit Card bill and on it there was a transaction for {$490.00}. I do not have an Ulta Beauty Rewards Mastercard Credit Card and I did not make that transaction. I immediately took the following steps : I reported identify theft to the FTC - XXXX. # XXXX I froze my credit I open disputes with the credit bureaus I called the credit card issuing bank which is Comenity Capital Bank. 

Speaking with the fraud depart of Comenity Capital Bank, I opened a fraud case # XXXX. I was told to call back in 2 weeks. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called back and was told they need more time to complete the investigation. Some time in XXXX I receive a phone call from Comenity Capital Bank asking me when I plan to pay my Ulta Beauty Rewards Mastercard Credit Card bill. I explained to the fraudulent situation and was transferred to the Comenity Capital Bank fraud group. After explaining again that the card was NOT opened by me and the charge was NOT mine, the fraud representative said they will follow up on my case. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a letter from Comenity Capital Bank that after their thorough investigation of my claim, they have concluded that I am not responsible for the disputed balance amount on the Ulta Beauty Rewards Mastercard credit card account. In addition they have submitted a request to the 3 national credit reporting agency to remove this account from my credit bureau report; signed the Account Protection Team. On the same day of receiving this letter, I wrote a letter to Comenity Capital bank to please forward proof that this fraudulent account has been closed. Instead of receiving proof of the account closed, I received copies of the XX/XX/XXXX letter on XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX. 

At this point everything seemed to be completed appropriately until XX/XX/XXXX. I received a letter from Comenity Capital Bank - from their Recovery Team, informing me the Ulta Beauty Rewards Mastercard credit card account was closed, charged off and sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called Comenity Capital Bank, spoke to someone named XXXX XXXX about how the account was fraudulent, how I have documentation stating I am not responsible for the charges and was assured the issue will be looked into. 

Since XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has called, sent letters and even provided copies of Ulta Credit card bills that were never delivered to my address. The debt collection agency claims I now owe {$710.00} and if I want to dispute this debt I can write them about it. 

Here is the problem with entire scenario. Not only is my time valuable, the charge was determined by Comenity Capital Bank to not be my responsibility and yet now I am in a position, where I am responsible for defending myself to a debt collector when they shouldn't have access to the account in the first place. There is something inappropriate happening here. Either Comenity is completely incompetent or perhaps they are selling fake overdue accounts. Another possible scenario is the collection agency is working to collect on known resolved accounts and are trying to swindle money from me that I do not owe. This is why I am submitting this complaint.

2024-12-29,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Old information reappears or never goes away,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the repeated failure of XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax to properly investigate and validate disputed information on my credit report, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), codified at 15 U.S.C. 1681. Despite my numerous disputes and lawful requests for validation and verification, the credit reporting agencies have failed to provide evidence substantiating their claims and continue to report inaccurate and unverified information.

To summarize : 1.Failure to Provide Proper Validation : I requested the following documents to validate the alleged debts : Validation of the debt ( including actual accounting ) ; Verification of the claim against me ( such as a sworn affidavit or a hand-signed invoice compliant with the Bills of Exchange Act, XXXX ) ; A true and certified copy of the original contract or agreement binding both parties ; A certified copy of the original note ( credit agreement ) under penalty of perjury, confirming it has not been sold ; Confirmation of the identity of the authorized representative who performed due diligence under the Money Laundering Regulations XXXX. 
These lawful requests were ignored or inadequately addressed. Instead, I received generic responses claiming the information was verified, without any substantive evidence to support these claims. 
2.Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable investigation when disputes are raised. Merely stating that the information was verified without providing evidence or details of the investigation constitutes a failure to meet this legal standard.

3.Reappearance of Removed Items : Items previously removed from my credit report have inexplicably reappeared, raising serious concerns about the integrity of the investigation process and adherence to proper procedures.

4.Failure to Respond in Good Faith : My repeated attempts to dispute these inaccuracies were met with dismissive responses warning me not to send further disputes. This is both inappropriate and contrary to consumer protection laws under the FCRA. 

Given the severity of these issues, I am requesting immediate action to : 1.Conduct a thorough, independent investigation into the practices of XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax in handling my disputes ; 2.Ensure compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i by requiring the credit reporting agencies to provide documented proof of their investigations and validations ; 3.Remove any and all unverifiable and inaccurate items from my credit reports ; 4.Impose penalties or corrective actions against the credit reporting agencies for non-compliance with FCRA standards.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30327,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11310217

2024-12-29,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction problem,,"Shellpoint made an Unauthorized credit to my loan principal for {$7900.00}. I requested the refund on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and they told me it would take 3 business days which was due Friday, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. After not getting my money I called and they said I wouldn't get my money back until XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. After that date no money was received so I called again and they said would be 14 business days since the request. But still nothing. I chatted with Shellpoint on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and the representative said "" No ETA at this time showing on the notes ''. 
I don't understand why this happened in the first place. The money was a wire transfer my husband made on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to reinstate my loan that was in foreclosure. Unfortunately, he made a mistake in the reference number so Shellpoint couldn't identify the destination, or at least that's what they told me the many times I called trying to fix the problem. After many unsuccessful attempts, and because Shellpoint sent a new reinstatement letter that we needed to pay, we ended up recalling the wire on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and counting with the money going back to us. We had to borrow money from friends to be able to pay the new reinstatement letter. I made many calls following up on the recall but all the time they said they didn't know anything. Until XXXX XX/XX/XXXX when we called and to our surprise they said Shellpoint credited the money to my loan on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Does it make any sense? The wire was recalled first of all on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. And in all my calls and emails I was very "" very clear '' that I needed this money back asap. I NEVER AUTHORIZE SHELLPOINT TO PUT THAT MONEY IN MY LOAN. I RECALLED THE WIRE ON XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX ASKED AT LEAST 5 TIMES SHELLPOINT TO AUTHORIZE THE RECALL BUT SHELLPOINT "" NEVER ANSWERED ''. INSTEAD, THEY PUT THE MONEY IN MY LOAN PRINCIPAL. 
I spoke with many customer service agents, all the time I had to tell the story again and again, most of them did not know anything and were unable to answer my questions, they just said to wait or create a ticket or escalate the ticket. I asked them if I could talk to a supervisor or to someone to get help but always they denied saying I can't talk to anybody. My family is suffering right now because we needed the money since XXXX. We have debts to pay. We have to pay the mortgage tomorrow and we don't have any money. I don't understand how Shellpoint deals with people. There's no access to a supervisor or wire department, ( I sent them many emails none of them replied ). Many bankers told me that it's absurd. That the recall was supposed to be resolved a long time ago. XXXX told XXXX that they asked at least 5 times Shellpoint to authorize the debt to do the refund but Shellpoint never answered the request of XXXX. Why??? I already made a complaint with XXXX  and so far no response. I hope with this complaint I get some answer because I don't know what else to do. Should I go to an attorney or bring Shellpoint to court? In another call I spoke with XXXX, and she said my refund request was made on Friday, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. That's a lie! I called 3 days before and spoke with a guy XXXX he was the one doing the refund request and he said it would take 3 business days. Why XXXX didn't see that? Do you see what I'm saying? Shellpoint is a Mess! the agents are lost! they don't know what they doing or saying! it's just ridiculous! Shellpoint doesn't care for the clients. I remember with another mortgage institution I had access to an account manager that would call me or email me directly with concerns about my account. Shellpoint doesn't have anything close to that. There are just agents answering calls or chatting but doing nothing... I don't know who really takes care of issues like mine. This is important. I NEED MY MONEY ASAP PLEASE! I need to pay my mortgage and I don't have the money now I might go into foreclosure again... is that what they are relooking for? so they can take more money from me?

I have used this method as a form of payment to them and all of my credit cards for years now with no issues. But when I tried to make my payment to Discover back in XXXX they said the bank said there was not enough funds and so it was rejected. I called my bank and they confirmed that Discover never tried to take payment and that my balance had more than enough to cover my payment to them. I then called Discover back which took me days as I was constantly pushed around their customer service universe from XXXX XXXX  world country to the other. Finally, I spoke to a rep again and they said my checking account could no longer be used to make payments to my Discover card and could not give me a real reason. When I asked How am I suppose to make a payment? He suggested I send a check which Im not able to do with my bank. I explained this to the rep and he told me He didnt know how else to pay it? So then I told him I wanted to close my account cause I was done with Discover. He closed my account, and Im still unable to make the payment to Discover, and now they are charging me late fees and interest, etc. I also recently received a letter from Discover that I was no longer allowed to use their customer service as they said I was rude to their customer service agent. Honestly, I was rude cause this whole this is ridiculous! Ive been a customer of theres for XXXX years, and have never missed a payment.

American Express knows exactly which transactions are an online purchase. One example is that a CVV code was used to authorize the transaction, and there was no swipe or tap, or chip inserted. Additionally, American Express is aware that it is a retail transaction as it is categorized as Merchandise & Supplies - Furnishing. American Express is willfully denying benefits it advertises by using arbitrary reasons to deny the benefit despite them clearly being aware that the transaction was an online XXXX retail purchase.

2024-12-29,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Account opened without my consent or knowledge,"To whom it concerns, As a Financial Instituion, A Bank must investigate and conduct a reasonable proper investigation of unauthorized transactions. Independent Financial is attempting to Dishonor Regulation E, and Believes they are above all Financial Regulations and Rules. To protect consumers, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), as implemented by Regulation E, requires financial institutions to investigate when a consumer notifies them of an error for an electronic fund transfer ( EFT ), to communicate the results within specific timelines and correct the error if one is found, and to limit the consumers liability if the error involves unauthorized transactions. Independent Financial not only denied my unauthorized transaction claim, they closed and "" Ended the Banking Relationship '' as they state so they do not have to provide further evidence. I believe this bank is violating Regulation E Guidelines, and I do not believe they are conducting proper investigations, I will provide some evidence below. First and foremost, the Bank has not only falsely accused me, they have not provided sufficient supporting documentation which is in my right to request either. Independent Financial was notified on XX/XX/XXXX that my debit card and pin number and wallet and phone were stolen. At the same time a dispute was opened. Transactions had occurred at multiple places, when I was able to review the transaction history by statement that I had to call in and request. First and foremost these transactions were conducted at a XXXX XXXX In XXXX Oklahoma, and a XXXX XXXX in XXXX Oklahoma. I live in XXXX, Texas. These locations are between 2-3 Hours away from me. I did not visit these merchants or establishments at any point in time, and I did not conduct business at these merchants. I will provide further transaction evidence below. I notified Independent Financial within 60 Day 's Which is required by law. Once you receive your statement, If you determine there is an error on the account, then you must notify the bank promptly which is what I have done. Instead of conducting a proper regulation E investigation, It was determined by XXXX XXXX, that He doesn't have to conduct an investigation. By Email his response said he conducted his own "" Review '' Investigation and determined that no error occurred. In the claim Denial letter it states I can request Documentation used in their investigation by calling Customer Service. However XXXX has stated that he does not have to provide documentation used in his investigation because he doesn't believe he has to. Even though it states that on company letter head. So he has advised XXXX XXXX to close and end the banking relationship, To shush me from calling in and requesting documentation used in their investigation. Instead of Following Banking Guidelines the bank chooses to end the customer relationship, and instead FALSELY accuse the customer the victim of theft of being the one conducting the theft. This is false. Secondly, They state that the transactions were conducted at my Home Address. That's not possible because the merchants themselves, XXXX and XXXX XXXX said that the transactions occurred by Physical Card swipe, and Pin Key. So again this is false information they are providing in their response. They also state they previously responded to the matter on XX/XX/XXXX and in their response their "" Review Concluded that the activity in the account was believed to be intentional '' Therefore they were unable to approve the claim. As I stated previously, When a wallet is stolen and you are robbed for your wallet, That is not intentional. No victim would choose to have their wallet robbed or intentionally stolen. I believe based on that statement that the bank is bias and proceeding to write false information and hate against a victim of theft in efforts to not have to resolve the issues at hand. The Bank has not conducted a proper investigation. It is not possible to pay for XXXX or XXXX XXXX from my home. I did not grant anyone permission to use my account, I did not intentionally get robbed or choose that either. This is slander for one, and I really believe the CFPB Should further investigate into this financial institution for what they are writing to consumers. XXXX XXXX may have proceeded from the theft. That's why he can't conduct a proper investigation. At this point it isn't clear. I filed a police report after Independent Financial Demanded I file one, and the police department Detective Page from the XXXX Police Department was investigating the crime however someone from Independent financial named XXXX called her and told her they would conduct their own investigation and that they did not want XXXX Police Department to further investigate the crime. XXXX. A Bank is responsible for fraudulent transactions that are conducted from a stolen Debit card and unauthorized EFT Transfer. The Bank is refusing to cooperate because the bank would rather end customer relationships, and hope that the customer doesn't pursue legal means to fight the bank in a court of law. At this point Independent Financial has stolen over {$5000.00} from me and It's unacceptable. I have provided documentation proof. The bank ended the customer relationship because the bank knows that I didn't conduct the fraud, If the bank wants to continue to falsely slander me, then I want documentation proof that shows that I was intentionally robbed. I do not want to see a false accusation in their response again. The bank believes they are above all consumer protection laws, they are financially abusing customers and victims of fraud. They fail to follow their due diligence when opening customers accounts. As I stated it's not possible to conduct a transaction that requires a physical customer signature and or physical customer card insert from your home address. However according to independent financial that the transactions occurred from my physical home address in XXXX Texas, and somehow processed in XXXX Oklahoma and XXXX Oklahoma. Which is not possible. I am a victim of fraud, and I do believe at this point Independent Financial owes me documentation used in their investigation, an apology letter, and XXXX XXXX. As, Independent Financial has bypassed following the EFT ACT, and Has attempted to bypass XXXX XXXX Liability Policy, and Lastly, has definitely bypassed investigating the unauthorized transactions that occurred with the stolen debit card and pin. Much less to their statement of stating that I conducted the transactions intentionally, from my home address WHICH IS FALSE. As I stated previously, No one wants to be intentionally robbed. I stated where I was robbed, and I provided supporting documentation. An Identity Theft Affidavit, A Police Report, and Proof that the police report listed the transactions from Independent Financial. Independent Financial can end the banking relationship that is fine, because I didn't do anything. I am a victim of theft, and I did not intentionally rob myself. That doesn't make sense and that is not conducting a proper investigation. I am requesting Documentation used in their investigation, and I am requesting that the bank be investigated for Violating Consumer Laws and Rights. Especially Regulation E. Since this bank is a CFPB Regulated bank, I would like for Independent Financial to be investigated by the CFPB. Regulation E is not being followed by this bank, and instead they are falsely accusing consumers that are victims of theft and fraud, and refusing to conduct a proper investigation, refusing to provide documentation. If a Claim is Denied a Bank must provide supporting documentation that strongly supports the denial at a consumers request, which this bank is refusing to honor. In their Letter on Company Letter head it even states I am entitled to request documentation used in their investigation. However when I did so, they told me they have to transfer me to XXXX XXXX and they called over XXXX XXXX XXXX and got no response. They have no documentation. Truly, all the Bank has done is slander and falsely accuse me the victim of fraud. The Bank owes me for the fraudulent transactions and I fully expect my cashiers check or funds. I can pickup in branch. I am not going away, and I do not believe my issues are being addressed. Also I never filed a dispute on any online banking transfers that occurred. I filed a dispute on the transactions listed below which occurred by PHYSICAL CARD SWIPE AND BY ENTERING THE CARD NUMBER. This requires a pin number and additionally, these transactions correlate to me being robbed. I did not intentionally rob myself, and I did not intentionally have anyone rob me. However in their latest response it states that I said I disputed the online banking transfers that occurred which is false. The Transactions I have listed below all show to be physical card swipes POS transactions and ATM Withdrawals and these are the transactions I have disputed. These transactions are unauthorized. These transactions are protected by mastercard XXXX liability policy, and Additionally, In the rules and regulations these transactions are protected by Regulation E. I did not intentionally conduct these transactions. These transactions were conducted and my wallet and card and pin were stolen as I mentioned these transactions were not conducted from my home address it's very frustrating to be told and slandered that you were intentionally robbed. No one wants to intentionally be robbed I assure you that. I did not conduct these charges. I listed the transactions below and also on my police report. The Police Report that is attached, and the email submission picture proof shows that the report was filed with these listed transactions to the XXXX Police Department. This is further proof that I am a victim of fraud. Again I am not disputing Online Transfers. I am disputing transactions I did not conduct with a card and pin that were stolen. Robbed. I am a victim of robbery/theft and not the person whom conducted the transactions.

Despite my efforts over the past XXXX years to provide evidence of identity theft, neither American Express nor the credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) have taken appropriate steps to resolve this matter. 

Here are the critical facts of this issue : XXXX. Identity Theft and Disputed Accounts : I was a victim of identity, a time during which XXXX American Express accounts in good standing were fraudulently used. 
I provided police reports and a Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report to American Express and the credit bureaus, documenting this crime and disputing the debts. 
Despite clear evidence that these debts were not mine, American Express refused to acknowledge the theft or resolve the accounts appropriately. 
XXXX. Lawsuit Filed and Dismissed : American Express National Bank pursued legal action against me in 2024, despite the ongoing identity theft dispute and my inability to pay for debts that were not mine. 
On XX/XX/year>, the court dismissed the case for want of prosecution ( DWOP ), with no judgment entered against me. This dismissal further supports my position that this debt is invalid and should not have been pursued in the first place.

3. Credit Reporting Negligence : Despite the dismissal and my repeated disputes, all three credit bureaus continue to report inaccurate and derogatory information related to these accounts and lawsuit.

The excuse provided by XXXX  the lawsuit was filed and therefore can not be removedis baseless given that the case was dismissed, and the accounts were the result of identity theft. 
The continued failure to address this issue violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates accurate and fair credit reporting. 

This negligence has severely impacted my credit standing and financial stability for years. The prolonged failure to remove fraudulent accounts and the erroneous lawsuit from my credit file has caused undue hardship, limiting my ability to rebuild after the closure of my business.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,TX,79905,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11315447

Despite providing substantial evidence that I did not authorize these purchases, PayPal has consistently closed my cases in favor of the seller, XXXX XXXX XXXX, without a thorough investigation or fair resolution. 

Summary of Issues : Unauthorized Transactions : I never made the purchases attributed to my account for goods from XXXX XXXX XXXX. These include disputes for sports card products I neither ordered nor received. 

Lack of Due Process : I provided detailed evidence, including correspondence, transaction histories, and a clear explanation of the issue, but PayPal closed over XXXX cases without resolving the disputes fairly. 

Seller Misrepresentation : The seller provided false information, such as claiming I agreed to their terms and conditions, and submitted fabricated evidence to PayPal, which the platform appeared to accept without verifying its authenticity. 

Monetary Impact : The total disputed amount across these cases is {$10000.00} USD. ( that I know of so far ) These unresolved disputes have caused significant financial harm. 

Recurring Issues with XXXX Dispute Resolution : XXXX dispute resolution process appears biased in favor of sellers, as cases are often closed with generic reasoning that lacks transparency or justification. 

Actions Taken : I attempted to resolve the issues directly with PayPal but was unsuccessful. 
The cases have now been closed, leaving me no recourse within XXXX platform. 
Request for Assistance : I request the CFPB to investigate XXXX handling of these disputes and require them to provide : A fair review of the evidence in each case. 
Transparency regarding their decision-making process. 
Reimbursement for the disputed amounts. 
Attached to this complaint are : Case summaries with transaction details.

Despite submitting all the necessary documentation and providing clear evidence to support my claim, I was informed that the dispute was either denied or delayed without proper justification within the required timeframe of fewer than 48 hours. This delay and subsequent denial directly contravene your obligation to provide timely responses under federal regulations, specifically the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and Regulation E guidelines for dispute investigations.

Despite my numerous disputes and lawful requests for validation and verification, the credit reporting agencies have failed to provide evidence substantiating their claims and continue to report inaccurate and unverified information. 

To summarize : 1.Failure to Provide Proper Validation : I requested the following documents to validate the alleged debts : Validation of the debt ( including actual accounting ) ; Verification of the claim against me ( such as a sworn affidavit or a hand-signed invoice compliant with the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882 ) ; A true and certified copy of the original contract or agreement binding both parties ; A certified copy of the original note ( credit agreement ) under penalty of perjury, confirming it has not been sold ; Confirmation of the identity of the authorized representative who performed due diligence under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. 
These lawful requests were ignored or inadequately addressed. Instead, I received generic responses claiming the information was verified, without any substantive evidence to support these claims.

2.Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable investigation when disputes are raised. Merely stating that the information was verified without providing evidence or details of the investigation constitutes a failure to meet this legal standard.

3.Reappearance of Removed Items : Items previously removed from my credit report have inexplicably reappeared, raising serious concerns about the integrity of the investigation process and adherence to proper procedures.

4.Failure to Respond in Good Faith : My repeated attempts to dispute these inaccuracies were met with dismissive responses warning me not to send further disputes. This is both inappropriate and contrary to consumer protection laws under the FCRA. 

Given the severity of these issues, I am requesting immediate action to : 1.Conduct a thorough, independent investigation into the practices of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX in handling my disputes ; 2.Ensure compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i by requiring the credit reporting agencies to provide documented proof of their investigations and validations ; 3.Remove any and all unverifiable and inaccurate items from my credit reports ; 4.Impose penalties or corrective actions against the credit reporting agencies for non-compliance with FCRA standards.",,Resurgent Capital Services L.P.,GA,30327,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11309949

Cann & Associates , Inc., This letter serves as formal notice that I dispute the alleged debt associated with the above reference number and demand that you cease and desist all communication and collection activities related to this matter immediately. 

Violation of Debt Collection Laws Upon review of your correspondence and alleged collection practices, I believe your actions violate multiple laws, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq., and other federal statutes, as follows : 1. Improper Assignment of Debt ( 812 ( a ) ) The letter you provided names XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as the original creditor. However, it appears that XXXX XXXX no longer owns this debt. If the debt was transferred or sold, your attempts to collect while referencing XXXX XXXX create a false and deceptive belief that XXXX XXXX is still participating in the collection effort. This violates 15 U.S.C. 1692e and 812 ( a ).

2. Extortionate Practices ( 18 U.S.C. 894 ) Your attempt to collect on this alleged debt, without proper proof of ownership or authority, amounts to extortionate practices. Under 18 U.S.C. 894, the use of any implicit or explicit threat to collect an extension of credit by improper means is strictly prohibited.

3. Failure to Provide Proper Validation Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g, your notice fails to meet the required standards for debt validation. Specifically : It does not adequately validate the debt with clear evidence of ownership and a full accounting of the alleged amount.

Despite having an active account for OVER XXXX years, I have been consistently blocked from accessing the mandatory credit reporting and freeze tools. XXXX months ago, while applying for a loan, I was unable to unfreeze my TransUnion credit report, which prevented the lender from accessing my credit file. Apparently, the lender uses Trans Union. As a result, I was unable to secure the lowEST-interest rate loan I was pursuing. I had to find an agency that used XXXX. these problems do not exist on my XXXX and XXXX profiles. I'm also aware of a number of friends that have the same issue with XXXX XXXX My credit score is consistently over XXXX. 

While I am able to log in to the TransUnion website, I am FIRST presented with offers to purchase their paid services. However, when I attempt to access my credit report or manage credit freezes, I am met with a message stating that the information can not be accessed at this time. This issue has persisted for almost XXXX years, and I have been unable to find an effective resolution or reliable communication channel with TransUnion to address this matter. 

I believe this behavior raises concerns about compliance with consumer rights to access their credit information and manage credit freezes as mandated by law. I respectfully request the CFPB 's assistance in resolving this issue and ensuring that TransUnion provides the required access to its services.
