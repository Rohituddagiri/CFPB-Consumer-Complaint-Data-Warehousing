The reporting of this charge-off violates several provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Specifically : 1. **15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) ** : This law mandates that consumer reporting agencies ensure maximum possible accuracy in the information they report. The charge-off status of this account does not accurately reflect my payment history and account status.

2. **15 USC 1681 ( e ) ** : This provision requires that agencies provide consumers with a clear explanation of their rights. XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX has failed to provide me with the necessary documentation to substantiate the charge-off, thereby violating my rights under this law. 

3. **15 USC 1681 ( 6 ) ** : This law prohibits the reporting of inaccurate information. As the charge-off does not accurately represent my dealings with XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX it constitutes a violation of this statute. 

I request that you conduct a thorough investigation of this matter and remove the inaccurate charge-off from my credit report. 

Please ensure that all communications regarding this dispute are directed to my address provided above. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your response within the time frame specified by law.

Below, I have detailed the specific violations and my concerns regarding Experians handling of my dispute concerning the account with XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( Account # XXXX ). 

On [ XX/XX/XXXX ], I filed a dispute with Experian regarding inaccuracies in the reporting of the above-referenced account. I waited over 35 days for a resolution, only to receive a response claiming the information was accurate, without proper investigation or correction of the errors I identified.

Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ) : Experian is required to conduct a reasonable investigation of disputes. Despite providing detailed evidence to demonstrate inaccuracies in the accounts payment history, balance, and status updates, Experian failed to reasonably investigate or address the errors. The ongoing reporting of incorrect information indicates negligence in fulfilling this obligation.

Failure to Provide Results of the Investigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ) :
Experians response to my dispute did not include the necessary details regarding their investigation. They failed to explain how the disputed information was verified as accurate or provide supporting evidence from the furnisher XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Failure to Correct or Delete Inaccurate Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ) : The investigation results did not lead to the correction or deletion of the following inaccuracies : Payment history inaccurately shows delinquent activity in XXXX, despite the account being charged off in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Balance updates as recent as XX/XX/XXXX suggest re-aging of the debt, a practice prohibited under the FCRA. 

Discrepancies in the reported balance ( {$520.00} ), past due amount ( {$520.00} ), and highest balance ( {$580.00} ).

Failure to Consider Consumer-Provided Evidence ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) ) : I provided supporting documentation highlighting these inaccuracies, which Experian appears to have ignored during their investigation. This failure to consider or forward relevant information to the furnisher violates the FCRA. 
Continuing to Report Disputed Information Without Proper Verification ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) ) : Experian continues to report inaccurate information despite its failure to properly verify the validity of the disputed account details. This practice further undermines the reliability of the credit reporting process.

I request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring Experian complies with its legal obligations under the FCRA. Specifically, I ask that Experian : Conduct a thorough and reasonable investigation into my dispute. 

Provide a detailed explanation of the steps taken to verify the disputed information and include supporting documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Correct or delete all inaccurate or unverifiable information related to the disputed account. 

Implement measures to prevent future violations and ensure compliance with the FCRA.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust the CFPB will investigate Experians actions and ensure they fulfill their obligations under the law. Please feel free to contact me if additional information or documentation is required.

**Factual Background** : - Experian has persisted in representing this account as accurate, notwithstanding my successful dispute with XXXX, which culminated in the removal of said account from my credit profile. 
- This inconsistency raises substantial concerns regarding the reliability and validity of Experian 's verification process.

**Legal Basis** : - Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i, consumer reporting agencies are mandated to expeditiously delete any disputed item that has been determined to be inaccurate or unverifiable. 
- The conflicting results from the same financial institution signify a potential failure in Experian 's compliance with the statutory obligations established under 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ), which necessitate that consumer reporting agencies uphold standards of accuracy and integrity in reporting.

**Impact on Consumer Rights** : The ongoing reporting of this inaccurate account has inflicted significant harm upon my creditworthiness and overall financial well-being. Such conduct contravenes the principles enshrined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which underscores the necessity for fairness, impartiality, and consumer privacy. 

**Demand for Remedial Action** : I hereby demand the immediate expungement of this erroneous account from my Experian credit report. Enclosed, please find pertinent documentation from XXXX that corroborates my assertions. 

I respectfully implore the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to undertake a comprehensive investigation into the practices of Experian in this matter. I anticipate your prompt and thorough response to address my concerns.

With that they have a temporary way to place accounts in forbearance for 60 days to give time for application processing. I had done this twice but when further questioning the process I was told that I did not have to call and this would automatically be placed. This was concerning because after 60 days went buy mohela emailed me again saying my payments are due. So I took the time to call and I notice in the recording of the customer service call line it clearly states to ignore these bills as they are false. That being said I waited, trusting that when the due date came it would automatically be placed in forbearance. At the due day however that did not happen, my account went into past due. Based on this, I started calling the customer service starting with the call back option that is offered which never occurred. The next day I called again with an estimated wait time of 84 minutes and waited for about 3 hours in which I got connected to a customer service rep that agreed my account should be in forebearance but they had to transfer me. They transferred me to and I stayed on the phone another 4-5 hours until it was late at night when the call disconnected. I attempted a few other times between there where I could never even get to talk to the first person because the wait time were so long. I finally was able to get through the process in which I talked to 4 different reps, who were able to place my account in forbearance. I finally asked for a supervisor to talk about the poor quality and concerns about collections. The supervisor said that yea there recording says ignore your bills but she advised against that because if I would have listened to that recording and 90 days passed that I would have been at that time reported to credit companies and it would have impacted my credit. She also told me that there is nothing she can do to fix my account because this isnt a perfect world and that many other people are also not properly getting placed in forbearance. She also said there is nothing she can do about being on hold for 15+ hours yet again its not a perfect world. All this being said, this is worrisome and questionable collection practices. I am very worried by the fact that I would have had a ding on my credit if I would have listened to my lenders customer service line to ignore my bill. I am also highly concerned that my ability to get my questions answered about what is going on and fix it took me 15+ hours. A collection agency such as Mohela needs to be held to higher standards.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,IL,622XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11153808

Despite my initial dispute and your subsequent response stating the account was verified, I still believe that this charge-off entry is inaccurate and does not meet the standards outlined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

On [ XX/XX/year> ], I disputed the charge-off with Experian. However, after reviewing your response, it is clear that the investigation was insufficient and does not meet the legal requirements for accuracy or verification as outlined in the FCRA. Specifically, I dispute that the charge-off is valid, and I am requesting that this account be removed from my credit report if the creditor can not provide adequate verification. 

I am citing the following sections of the FCRA to support my position : XXXX. Section XXXX ( XXXX ) The FCRA mandates that all information reported to credit reporting agencies must be accurate. Despite the claim that the information has been verified, I have not been provided with sufficient documentation to substantiate the charge-off. 
XXXX. Section XXXX ( XXXX ) This section requires that the credit reporting agency and users of consumer reports ensure that the information is used for a permissible purpose and is accurate. The charge-off in question XXXX have been reported in error and lacks proper verification from the creditor. 
XXXX. Section XXXX This section requires that credit reporting agencies conduct a thorough investigation into any dispute within 30 days. Given that my initial dispute was not properly investigated, I am requesting that you reinvestigate the charge-off, paying particular attention to whether the creditor has adequately verified the account. 
Under Section XXXX of the FCRA, if a charge-off can not be properly verified, the credit reporting agency is obligated to delete the inaccurate information from my credit report. 

I am requesting the following actions from the credit reporting agency : * Proof of verification from the creditor, including account statements, payment history, or any other documents supporting the charge-off. 
* If the creditor is unable to provide adequate verification of the charge-off, I request that the entry be immediately deleted from my credit report. 
I am also requesting that the CFPB intervene to ensure that my rights under the FCRA are upheld and that my credit report is accurate and free of any misleading or incorrect information. 
Failure to properly address this dispute and verify the charge-off entry violates my rights under the FCRA and XXXX result in further legal action if this matter is not resolved promptly. I request that the CFPB help ensure compliance with the FCRA and prompt resolution of this issue. 

RESOLUTION * Ensure the charge-off is verified or deleted in compliance with FCRA Sections XXXX ( XXXX ), XXXX ( XXXX ), and XXXX. 
* Ensure that the credit reporting agency conducts a proper and timely reinvestigation and resolves this issue within the XXXX period outlined in the FCRA. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

2024-12-14,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Paying off the loan,"Exhibit XXXX - My company XXXX XXXX XXXX has a mortgage with Lendsure based on a Term Sheet dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

Exhibit XXXX - We secured the loan for {$650000.00} of which {$82000.00} was set aside as Construction Holdback. We paid points amounting to {$16000.00} for the full amount of the loan, reflected on the Settlement Statement Exhibit XXXX - We paid for a full year, interest only at a rate of 10.999 % Exhibit XXXX - We applied for a loan modification wherein the original note shall be extended for 6 months and a {$50000.00} additional amount will be added to the loan, bringing the outstanding loan to {$700000.00} due by XX/XX/XXXX. 

Exhibit XXXX - Lendsure sent a mortgage statement with a Draw XXXX from the Construction Holdback amounting to {$22000.00} as payment for the loan extension. 

Exhibit XXXX - We sent a request for a release of Construction funds by XXXX but Lendsure deducted XXXX payment from the Draw XXXX amounting to {$29000.00}. On an email by Lendsure, they explained that only {$59000.00} was approved as construction funds. 

Exhibit XXXX - A mortgage statement for XXXX shows the current interest rate of 10.999 % and monthly due as {$6100.00}. Our total Draw was {$22000.00} leaving {$59000.00} as available funds Exhibit XXXX - A mortgage statement for XXXX shows the current interest rate of 10.999 % and monthly due as {$6100.00}. The total Draw was {$52000.00} to include the XXXX rent and release of funds. We still have {$29000.00} as remaining holdback funds. 

This is where the problem arises. We wanted to use the remaining Holdback Funds of {$29000.00} as rent payment for the remaining month since we are selling the property. At the rate of 10.999 % and {$6100.00} per month, these funds are enough to cover payments until XXXX. 

Exhibit XXXX - A mortgage Statement for XXXX shows current rates at 10.999 % and the same monthly amount due. Total Holdback is still {$52000.00} Exhibit XXXX - A mortgage Statement for XXXX shows interest rate is 24 %, and Holdback funds totaling {$82000.00}. Our monthly amount due is now {$14000.00}. We did not receive any other notice for the default rate being applied. 

Exhibit XXXX - We sent an email to question the default rate application, and the holdback funds not being applied to cover XXXX thru XXXX payments, like they did last XXXX. 

Exhibit XXXX - Lendsure sent a Pay off amount, demanding total payment of {$740000.00} and showing a {$14000.00} since XXXX. They also charged me {$14000.00} from XXXX and XXXX using the unused Holdback Funds of {$29000.00} No other notices were sent to tell us of this rate adjustment. In fact, their mortgage statements from XXXX thru XXXX shows a rate of 10.999 % and only {$6100.00} per month. 

Exhibit XXXX - XXXX mortgage statement showing default rate Exhibit XXXX - We paid Lendsure a total amount of {$750000.00} to fully satisfy the loan. We should have only owed {$700000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX, and should be charged only default rate of 24 % effective XXXX when the original note expired.",,EF CORPORATE HOLDINGS LLC,CA,94112,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11147566

The total amount of the purchase was {$1500.00}, and I was using my Bank of America virtual debit card, which had a balance of {$2000.00}.

During the transaction, Bank of America flagged the purchase as an unusual transaction and blocked my card. The purchase was declined multiple times. I immediately called Bank of America customer service and explained the situation. They assured me they had unlocked the card, but despite being told this repeatedly ( around 30 times ), the card remained locked. 

The customer service representative asked me multiple verification questions, all of which I answered correctly. However, they were unable to resolve the issue and claimed they did not know why the card could not be unlocked. This entire process took around 30 minutes.

I have a recorded phone message documenting this interaction, which clearly demonstrates Bank of Americas failure to unlock my card despite multiple assurances. 

Because of this failure to unlock my card, I was unable to complete the purchase, resulting in significant financial loss for my business. I could not restock liquor for the night, forcing me to close the bar early, which led to lost sales and dissatisfied customers.

1.

Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to do.

2. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 68026805 ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ).

**Legal Basis** : - Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i, consumer reporting agencies are mandated to expeditiously delete any disputed item that has been determined to be inaccurate or unverifiable.

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"Dear CFPB, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request an investigation into the procedures employed by the major credit reporting agenciesTransUnion, XXXX, and Experianregarding the accuracy of information reported on my credit file. I am concerned about certain inaccuracies that I have identified and the subsequent failure of these agencies to provide adequate responses and documentation, which I believe constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Background Recently, I submitted complaints to XXXX, XXXX, and Experian regarding incorrect information reported on my credit reports. Despite my efforts to address these inaccuracies, I have not received satisfactory responses or valid proof of the claims made by these agencies. Most importantly, I have repeatedly requested to review the "" Procedures of Accuracy '' that these agencies claim to use to verify the information in my reports. Thus far, I have not received any meaningful information or documentation in response to my requests. 

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) The FCRA outlines specific responsibilities for credit reporting agencies, including the requirement to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Below are specific violations of the FCRA that I believe warrant your investigation : 1. Section 607 ( b ) - Reasonable Procedures : Credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. I have doubts that XXXX, XXXX, and Experian have adhered to this requirement in my case, as the inaccuracies I reported have not been corrected nor explained. 

2. Section 611 - Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy : Upon receiving my dispute, these agencies are mandated to conduct a reasonable investigation of my claims within 30 days. I submitted my dispute to all three agencies, but they have failed to provide the required investigation results or documentation supporting the accuracy of the reported information. Their lack of response is a clear violation of this section.

3. Failure to Validate Debts : When I identified the inaccuracies, I requested that the agencies provide validation of the debts and the procedures they used to verify the informations accuracy. Under the FCRA, they are obligated to provide this information and their failure to do so represents another violation of my consumer rights.

4. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - Duty of Furnishers of Information : Any entity that provides information to consumer reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy of that information. If the information provided is found to be inaccurate, the furnishers have a duty to correct it. I am concerned that the agencies are not holding these furnishers accountable for the inaccurate reporting. 

XXXX. Lack of Adequate Consumer Responses : The agencies have not provided timely or useful responses to my inquiries, which I believe underlines a broader failure to protect consumer rights as mandated by the FCRA. 

Request for Action Given the collective issues I have faced, I respectfully ask the CFPB to conduct a thorough investigation into the practices of XXXX, XXXX, and Experian regarding how they handle inaccuracies and disputes. Furthermore, I urge your office to compel these agencies to provide their "" Procedures of Accuracy '' and ensure they are compliant with the FCRA requirements. 

As a consumer, I have the right to accurate credit reporting, and the current situation jeopardizes my financial health and fundamental rights. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response. 



I am writing to you to formally request a copy of the procedure your company followed in order to ensure that the information reporting for account XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX is completely accurate.It 's strange, you did a full investigation to verify the accuracy of this account due to the fact that you continue to report the wrong information. 

It is frightening to think that you did not do as you are governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act andthat other consumer might be affected Having this type of information on a person'sa credit report is unfortunate and severely damaging, but having incorrect damaging information ona person 's credit report is unacceptable. 

Please forward to me the name of the person you spoke with atINQUIRY, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, INQUIRY, INQUIRY, INQUIRY and the date that you spoke with them. I also want a confirmation of the address and phone number for the company. 

INQUIRY - XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, INQUIRY - XX/XX/XXXX, INQUIRY - XX/XX/XXXX, INQUIRY - XX/XX/XXXX As I have said, this account is incorrect and should be deleted entirely. Please send me anupdated credit report along with the investigation procedures. 

FYI, I DO NOT want a generalizedresponse stating what you typically do in an investigation.

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title and Section.After the case with XXXX XXXX XXXX , the Consumer Federal Protection Bureaus ( CFPB ) took action against XXXX XXXX XXXX to their illegal debt collection and credit reporting practices. XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect on disputed debts using unlawful collection letters and misrepresentation. The CFPB stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect debt that was NOT substantiated after consumers disputed the validity of the debt conducted an investigation and found that XXXX sent collection letters to consumers who DISPUTED the validity or accuracy of their purported debts, even though XXXX had NOT obtained substantiation for the debts. As a debt collection, the CFPB states you are required to have a reasonable basis for assertion that a consumer owes the purported debt if a dispute is submitted. As a result, the CFPB required XXXX XXXX XXXX to pay redress to affected consumer and pay a {$1.00} XXXX penalty to the CFPBs victim relief fund.

The CFPB outlined a list of requests we, as consumer, can ask for when we are seeking proper validation of debt to ensure you are ethically seeking debt legally.

Section 609 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) grants me the right to access all information in my file, including the inquiries made. After reviewing this information, I firmly believe that the inquiries listed above should not be on my report.

Section 604 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ) defines the permissible purposes for obtaining credit reports. I did not give my consent for these inquiries to be made, and I can not find a permissible purpose under this section that justifies their presence on my report.

Request I request an immediate investigation into the listed inquiries. If it is determined that these inquiries were made without my authorization or in error, I ask that they be removed from my credit report. I also request that you provide me with an updated copy of my credit report once the necessary corrections have been made.

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To Whom It XXXX Concern, I am filing a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate reporting of an account on my credit report, which I am requesting be removed entirely. The account in question is a XXXX  account, where I was listed as an authorized user. Below are the account details : Account Name XXXX XXXX  Account Number : [ If available, you can include the last XXXX digits of the account number here ] Reported Balance : {$5200.00} Last Reported Date : XX/XX/XXXX Credit Limit : {$2100.00} Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Account Closed : XX/XX/XXXX The issue at hand is that this account was reported as closed with a balance of {$5200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, despite my role as an authorized user and not the primary account holder. Furthermore, the dispute resolved status showing "" subscriber disagrees '' is entirely inaccurate. As an authorized user, I do not hold responsibility for the balance, and the statement is misleading. 

I request the immediate removal of this account from my credit report. The account has been inaccurately reported, and its inclusion is harmful to my XXXX XXXX and financial well-being. 

Legal Basis for Request : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section XXXX ( a ), furnishers of credit information are required to provide accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies. The current reporting of this account violates the FCRA in the following ways : Inaccurate Reporting : The account was reported as a closed account with an outstanding balance. As an authorized user, I have no legal responsibility for the balance, and this should be reflected in the reporting. 

Dispute Status : The "" subscriber disagrees '' status is inaccurate and misleading. This indicates a dispute that I did not initiate or resolve, which is a violation of the FCRA 's requirement for accurate information. 

Failure to Correct Information : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies and furnishers correct any inaccuracies in a timely manner. The failure to accurately report the account as authorized user status rather than primary account holder is a violation of this obligation. 

Due to these violations, I am requesting that this entire account be removed from my credit report. The incorrect reporting of this account has caused significant harm to my credit and financial standing. 

Potential Legal Action : Should this matter not be resolved in a timely manner, I will consider pursuing legal action for damages under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as I have suffered harm due to inaccurate reporting. Under the FCRA, I am entitled to seek compensatory damages, including actual damages, statutory damages, and punitive damages for the failure to accurately report my credit information. 

I will also explore the option of engaging an attorney who specializes in consumer protection law and credit reporting disputes. A law firm such as The Law Offices of XXXX XXXX XXXX, which specializes in credit report disputes, FCRA violations, and consumer protection, can assist with this matter and pursue appropriate legal remedies if necessary.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,782XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11158757

XXXX knew they sold me a lemon to begin with and for them not be willing to fix the transmission and demand the car payments is not right at all. XXXX says the balance on the vehicle loan is {$13000.00} however to replace the transmission on my own would have cost me over {$4000.00} and I don't have that kind of money and is unable to keep up. I asked what else could be done since I could no longer drive the car since the transmission went out and I could no longer keep up with the payments due to financial hardship. XXXX said there was nothing they could do and allowed the car to sit outside of my house for 3 months on purpose so they can put it on my credit as a repossession and put a negative impact on my credit report. After going back and forth with XXXX I asked for my 1099-C to show the debt has been cancelled on their end and they wrote it off as income. When I finally received the 1099-C it does not have my correct address on it. I called XXXX to get answers they told me that I can put the 1099-C on my taxes however they did not mail me a new 1099-C with my correct address which would cause issues. XXXX told me I still owed the debt and the 1099-C form really doesn't mean anything anymore and it can not be used to remove the negative mark on my credit report and the 1099-C is only for my records.

XXXX never changed the address on the 1099-C because I never received an updated one which causes a discrepancy with the credit bureaus when I submitted the 1099-C to Experian, XXXX, and XXXX and filed disputes XXXX all three credit bureaus told me they spoke to XXXX and XXXX told them not to remove the negative mark and all the information on the 1099-C is accurate and that is not correct. I just checked my credit reports and all three credit bureaus have the XXXX negative mark to fall off XXXX of XXXX and it says Paid Off.

FCRA 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) ( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information.

business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer.

( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report.

( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.

( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed.

( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind.

( 1 ) In general.

( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title.

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew.

( d ) Exception for resellers.

( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller.

2024-12-14,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the inaccuracies in the reporting of my account by Experian. The inaccuracy constitute a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as articulated in 15 U.S. Code 1681e, which mandates consumer reporting agencies to maintain the maximum possible accuracy of the information they disseminate.

The current reporting of my account is erroneous and necessitates immediate CORRECTION. Specifically, it must be UPDATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH 26 CFR 1.6050P-1, which governs information reporting for discharges of indebtedness by specified entities. I have fully settled the account in question, AS PER THE CREDITORS POLICIES. I have submitted Form 1099-C for YOUR REVIEW AS PHYSICAL PROOF, which clearly indicates THE PREVIOUS BALANCE AS DISCHARGED AND REFLECTS a NEW balance of {$0.00}. Therefore, I formally demand that all three consumer reporting agencies rectify my account to accurately reflect its status as paid in full with a XXXX balance. 

The misleading nature of the current reporting not only contravenes applicable IRS regulations but also jeopardizes my creditworthiness and financial standing. Should this matter not be resolved expeditiously, I will have no choice but to explore legal remedies available to me under the FCRA, including the possibility of pursuing a lawsuit for damages resulting from this inaccurate reporting. 

I urge you to prioritize the correction of the account to reflect its accurate status as paid in full. I expect a prompt response and resolution regarding this matter.

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"On XX/XX/year> I received a physical piece of mail from Experian, indicating that I had submitted a credit dispute and that the results were approved. The results of this credit dispute were apparently updating my telephone number. The telephone number that was listed on my new credit report and account with experience was not my cell phone number, I called Experian to indicate that I had received this dispute and that the dispute was incorrect and someone likely has hacked my account with experience and is trying to change the cell phone number. They indicated I should go online and log into my account change my account information and save it. I did all of this, XXXX days later on XX/XX/year> I received an automated email from Experian saying that my account information was updated. I tried to log into Experian to see what was changed with my Experian account and was unable to log into my account because someone had hacked my account and changed my phone number associated with my Experian account. Since my phone number associated to my experience account was updated to a number that was not my cell phone number, I was unable to access my account which has multifactor authentication set up with an SMS text to verify before allowing someone to log into my account. At this point I had no way to access my Experian account because someone had hacked my experience account. Over the course of the next few days, I started to receive calls from various credit unions around the country asking me if I was in fact trying to open up a line of credit with their agencies. In each case I indicated no, and that I believed my account had been hacked. I tried calling Experian using the phone numbers they provide on their website and and all I can say about trying to get someone on the phone through their phone is it was, and continues to be, the single worst customer experience I have ever had in my entire adult life. It took numerous attempts and a combination of random buzz words for me to finally get through to someone at Experian when I explain the situation that I had received a dispute from them, which I did not file, that my account had been hacked, and I was currently having someone using my credit information that they stole from the Experian site to contact various credit unions trying to open up an account in my name, and that this all resulted from somebody hacking my experience account. They said all they could do was put a credit freeze on my account and put a credit fraud alert on my account, there was nothing the representatives could do to fix my account. After a few days I received an email for my support call asking if I was satisfied with the service they provided. I of course replied no and gave them a low rating for the customer satisfaction score. Days later, I again called Experian and was told that I needed to talk to a different department, the member services department, because the issue was with my account and not with my credit report. When I spoke to somebody in the member services department, again took 20 to 30 minutes of trying to navigate their phone tree, which no way shape or form made it easy or possible to speak to somebody about my current issue, I was told that the only way that they could unlock my account was by providing them with certain information : a copy my Social Security card, a copy of my drivers license, and a copy of a current bill with my current address on it. I started searching online to see if anybody else has had this issue with Experian and found numerous online threads with people that had experienced the same problem with Experian 's security settings on their accounts. Most of the post indicated that after calling back multiple times, they were finally able to talk to somebody that would reset their account over the phone so they could access it and change their information to avoid the hackers from having access to their experience account. Again, I tried calling them and pleading with them and continuing to provide all the details of what happened : timelines and specific details of what was happening on my account, they again said theres nothing they can do unless I either mail, fax, or upload those three documents their team for review. I first attempted to upload the documents through their web portal. Each time I uploaded the documents their web portal indicated that the format of the documents was not correct and that I should try different file type or size. I communicated over email with Experian telling them that I could not upload the documents to the web portal they provided because it was continuously getting rejected. They also provided me with guidance on different file types or file sizes to use to upload the documents, I tried every combination of file size and file type that they provided. None of these worked. The support claim I had open indicated that I could also physically mail these documents or fax these documents. I mailed and faxed these documents to the team on XX/XX/year>. I did get a tracking number or anything for me to confirm that they received the documents, but I did get a confirmation from the fax machine that it was received to the number they provided. Since XX/XX/year>, I have followed up weekly on my claim via email asking if theyve received these documents. Every time I get the same response, we havent received them yet or we dont know if we received them yet and they might be in processing. At this point its been over a month since I first noticed fraudulent activity on my experience account, they have done nothing to try to make this process easy or to try to resolve my issues over the phone. Despite the fact I can provide them with any piece of information they need to verify my identity, and I have to imagine with their online system they have logs to indicate what the previous phone number and email address were on my account and what the updated phone number and email addresses are on my account now. Im incredibly frustrated that their security protocols allowed a hacker to access my Experian account to have access to all of my credit information, and the hacker made numerous attempts to open lines of credit in my name. Yet they are unwilling to do anything to assist me other than continuing to push me to upload documents ( which doesnt work ), fax documents ( which I already did ), or mail documents ( which I already did ). I am beyond frustrated with lack of Customer Service and the lack of urgency on their behalf of trying to fix a clear security vulnerability with their system that is currently impacting my account and my credit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,CO,80304,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11147569

Age discrimination refers to the unfair treatment of an individual based on their age, particularly in employment contexts. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act ( ADEA ) of 1967 is the primary federal law that prohibits this type of discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age or older. The ADEA protects these individuals from being treated less favorably in various aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, promotions, job assignments, compensation, and benefits.

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) explicitly prohibits discrimination in credit transactions based on various factors, one of which is age. This means that lenders can not refuse to extend credit or impose different terms on applicants solely because of their age, provided they have the capacity to contract. The ECOA aims to ensure that all individuals, regardless of age, have equal access to credit opportunities.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,TN,37217,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11164201

This account is inaccurate and associated with identity theft. Specifically : 1. False credit disputes beginning in XX/XX/XXXX have been made in connection with this account, apparently to manipulate the alleged, unverified alleged debt back onto the associated checking account for financial gain. 
2. The alleged debt is unknown as to how it occurred, and still unverified at this time of writing. 
3. On my XXXX credit report, the account contains a "" Resolved '' Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) dispute notation, despite me never filing a dispute under FCBA.

4. On my XXXX credit report, a "" Consumer disputes after resolution '' comment has been added, even though no true resolution was reached, as the fake disputes were never adequately investigated by Bank of America despite my multiple written requests.

5. The account is not notated as being in litigation across XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, which it currently is. 
Bank of America has not acknowledged suspicious activity related to this account that I did not initiate nor did XXXX and XXXX XXXX. their attorneys. Despite this, my attempts to address these issues directly with Bank of America and their legal representatives, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, have resulted in repeated delays and insufficient action. XXXX and XXXX have agreed to pause legal proceedings pending further investigation, but the negative impact on my credit continues. I have also called XXXX times requesting the last contract on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I had under this account. This of which still has not been sent to me, and with the first XXXX requests being past 30 days of not receiving. Also, in the first CFPB complaint I did - XXXX in XXXX the accurate reporting letter sent to me was in error as I never did this dispute on the alleged balance, nor this account directly to Bank of America , nor have I did a dispute on the alleged balance, and account in XX/XX/XXXX to return all alleged charges to the associated checking account. Twice this year, I have requested a sworn affidavit or declaration in regards to the account both in XX/XX/XXXX via USPS, with tracking numbers to both Bank of America - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and, XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Both of which past 30 days to date in both requests from both companies after being shirked in regards to the identity theft. 
I have enclosed the following documents to substantiate my claims : 1. FTC Identity Theft Report.

2. Police Report and associated case number provided by Bank of America that is : XXXX. 
3. Illinois Attorney General Identity Theft Affidavit.

4. Correspondence between myself, Bank of America, and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. 
5. The final checking account statement from Bank of America, the last XXXX card statement ( ending in XXXX ), and Bank of America notices showing fraudulent disputes on the account.

6. XXXX dispute information, along with XXXX and XXXX credit reports showing the aforementioned inaccuracies. 
7. A response from the Illinois Attorney General regarding this matter to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX.

2024-12-14,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Since XX/XX/year>, I have had multiple promotional balances on my CareCredit account, each with deferred interest terms and varying expiration dates. My goal has always been to pay off these balances in the order of their expiration dates to avoid deferred interest charges. To achieve this, I set up automatic payments of {$140.00} per month and later increased my payments significantly, with a payment of {$770.00} in XX/XX/year> and {$570.00} in XX/XX/year>. Despite this, CareCredit allocated my payments proportionally across all promotional balances, rather than prioritizing the earliest expiring balances. 

For example : - XX/XX/year> XXXX of {$770.00} : Under CareCredits allocation method, this payment was split across multiple balances, leaving {$410.00} unpaid on the balance expiring XX/XX/year>. Had this payment been applied in full to the earliest expiring balance, it could have been completely paid off, ensuring I avoided deferred interest charges on that balance. 

- XX/XX/year> Payment of {$570.00} : This payment was also divided proportionally. By this point, the XX/XX/year> balance was finally cleared, but only after multiple months of missed opportunities to fully pay it off earlier. 
CareCredits proportional allocation method has left me at risk of deferred interest charges, even though I made sufficient payments to cover the earliest expiring balances. Furthermore, their statements lack transparency, as they do not clearly show how payments are applied to individual balances, making it difficult for me to verify whether payments are being applied effectively. 

When I contacted CareCredit to request that my payments be allocated to the earliest expiring balances, I was told this was not possible unless I manually requested reallocation after each payment had posted. This process is burdensome and impractical, as payments take 3-5 business days to post, and reallocating payments requires contacting customer service each month. As a busy individual relying on automatic payments, I believe this process is intentionally designed to make avoiding deferred interest charges unnecessarily difficult. 

I have attached statements from XX/XX/year> through XX/XX/year> to provide evidence of my payment history, how payments were allocated, and the lack of transparency in CareCredits monthly statements. These statements highlight the issues Ive described and support my request for a resolution.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,MI,49546,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11156538

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, MO. XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Complaint Against XXXX XXXX XXXX Regarding Improper Use of My Credit File To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX for violations of federal statutes related to the improper use of my credit file, reporting of information without consent, and failure to comply with legal obligations regarding debt reporting and income recognition. 
1. Unauthorized Use and Reporting of Credit Information : XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which specifies permissible purposes for obtaining and using consumer credit reports. I never provided written consent for XXXX XXXX XXXX to report any information to my credit file. According to 16 CFR 313.7, financial institutions must obtain explicit authorization from consumers before sharing nonpublic personal information unless an exception applies, none of which are applicable here. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX failed to do. Their actions also appear to violate 15 U.S.C. 6805, which empowers regulatory bodies to enforce these provisions. 
2. Charge-Off Reporting and Misclassification : A charge-off is a bookkeeping designation used by creditors for tax purposes when they consider a debt uncollectible. Under federal tax law, a charge-off can be treated as a cancellation of debt, which may constitute income to the debtor. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX did not issue a 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) form to me, as required under IRS regulations XXXX to substantiate that the debt was canceled and classified as income. Without this form, their reporting of the charge-off to credit reporting agencies is not only improper but also misleading. Moreover, a charge-off does not represent a valid certificate of indebtedness. A certificate of indebtedness reflects a binding obligation that is enforceable ; a charge-off, by its nature, implies that the debt has been resolved or abandoned by the creditor. Reporting a charge-off to credit bureaus under these circumstances constitutes inaccurate reporting. 
3. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : XXXX XXXX XXXX has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. 
I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 68026805 ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ). Additionally, I request clarification and appropriate remediation regarding : 1. The absence of a 1099-C form to substantiate the charge-off as canceled debt.

2. The improper classification of a charge-off as a certificate of indebtedness.

3. The unauthorized reporting of information to credit bureaus without my explicit written consent. Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

I look forward to your assistance in ensuring compliance and protecting my rights as a consumer.

I have encountered unresolved issues with my credit report that I have attempted to address through the dispute process but have not received a satisfactory resolution. 

Despite submitting multiple disputes and providing the necessary documentation to correct inaccuracies on my credit file, I have yet to see any meaningful progress in resolving these matters. Specifically, I am dissatisfied with the ongoing failure to address the discrepancies and the repeated letters stating that my credit profile can not be located, which I believe is unacceptable and does not comply with applicable laws. 

Given that these issues have remained unresolved and in accordance with the arbitration agreement, I am now taking the necessary steps to attempt an amicable resolution before proceeding with arbitration. This letter serves as my formal request to initiate the pre-arbitration process in good faith, and I seek to resolve this matter promptly. 

Please confirm receipt of this letter and provide further instructions on the next steps in this pre-arbitration process. If additional documentation or information is needed to proceed, I am happy to provide it. 

I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of these issues.

The debt, which originated with XXXXXXXX XXXX, has been placed in collections, and I have made multiple attempts to verify the accuracy and legitimacy of this debt. Despite my formal requests to the debt collection agency, they have failed to provide sufficient documentation or evidence to support their claim, violating my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Specific Issues Include : Failure to Provide Documentation of Authorization or Agreement I have requested documentation proving my authorization for this debt, such as a signed agreement or contract, but the collection agency has not supplied this information. 
Lack of Proof of Ownership or Right to Collect I requested proof that Midland Credit Management has the legal right to collect this debt, including the agreement or assignment from the original creditor ( XXXXXXXX XXXX ), but no such evidence has been provided. 
Failure to Validate Key Account Information Despite my requests, the collection agency has not provided critical details, such as : The date of first delinquency. 
The date of last payment. 
The date the account was charged off by the original creditor. 
Potential Inaccurate Reporting to Credit Bureaus Without adequate validation, I am concerned that the debt may have been reported inaccurately to the credit bureaus, negatively affecting my credit score and financial standing. 
Requested Resolution : I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter to ensure Midland Credit Management complies with federal debt collection and reporting laws. 
I ask that the collection agency be required to provide all requested documentation proving the validity of this debt, their right to collect it, and its accurate reporting. 
If they can not provide such evidence, I request that the debt be removed from my credit report and that all collection activity be ceased immediately.

2024-12-14,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Struggling to pay your bill,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"On or around XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America offered a settlement agreement to resolve my account for less than the full balance. The agreed-upon settlement amount was {$3500.00}, to be paid in three installments : {$1100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX {$1100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX {$1100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX This settlement offer was clearly discussed, and I began fulfilling my part of the agreement by preparing for the first payment. However, despite repeated requests, Bank of America has refused to provide this settlement agreement in writing. Additionally, I was charged a late fee, even though my understanding was that this account was covered under the agreed-upon settlement terms. 

Issues : Bank of America has failed to provide written confirmation of the settlement terms despite my repeated requests. 
A late fee was unfairly applied to my account after the settlement was offered. 
This behavior is misleading and creates unnecessary confusion for consumers attempting to resolve their accounts in good faith. It has caused me stress and financial uncertainty, as I am unsure whether my payments will be applied correctly or whether the terms of the agreement will be honored.

Resolution Sought : I request that Bank of America immediately provide a written confirmation of the settlement agreement terms as outlined above. 
I request the removal of the late fee and any associated penalties applied after the settlement agreement was made. 
I ask that Bank of America honor the settlement agreement and apply all payments made accordingly.

I have repeatedly contacted Capital One to request the issuance of a Form 1099-C, as required under the Internal Revenue Code, but have not received any resolution despite multiple attempts over an extended period. 

Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ), consumers are entitled to accurate and fair reporting of credit information. Furthermore, under IRS guidelines, when a debt is charged off, the creditor is typically required to issue a Form 1099-C if the debt meets specific thresholds for cancellation. This failure to provide a Form 1099-C has caused considerable personal and financial stress, as I need this documentation for my tax filings. 

Additionally, I have observed that Capital One continues to report late payments on this charged-off account each month. Once an account is charged off, the addition of late payments contradicts accurate reporting practices and unfairly penalizes my credit standing, further exacerbating my difficulties. 

This unresolved issue has had a profound and stressful impact on my life, preventing me from moving forward with purchasing my first home for my family. I request the CFPBs assistance in ensuring Capital One complies with its legal obligations by : 1. Issuing the Form 1099-C for the charged-off debt.

2. Ensuring the account is accurately reported on my credit file without further monthly late payment notations. 



I respectfully request a resolution to this matter within 15 days from the date of this letter. Please let me know if further information is required to expedite this process.

XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Complaint Against NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION Regarding Improper Use of My Credit File To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION for violations of federal statutes related to the improper use of my credit file, reporting of information without consent, and failure to comply with legal obligations regarding debt reporting and income recognition. 
1. Unauthorized Use and Reporting of Credit Information : NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION has failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which specifies permissible purposes for obtaining and using consumer credit reports. I never provided written consent for NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION to report any information to my credit file. According to 16 CFR 313.7, financial institutions must obtain explicit authorization from consumers before sharing nonpublic personal information unless an exception applies, none of which are applicable here. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION failed to do. Their actions also appear to violate 15 U.S.C. 6805, which empowers regulatory bodies to enforce these provisions. 
2. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 68026805 ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ). Additionally, I request clarification and appropriate remediation regarding : The unauthorized reporting of information to credit bureaus without my explicit written consent. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in ensuring compliance and protecting my rights as a consumer.

2024-12-14,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Fees charged,"Shellpoint/New Rez Mortgage began foreclosure proceedings on my property As a result I was assessed legal fees totaling {$4300.00}. I have attempted, unsuccessfully on numerous occasions to obtain proof of non payment. This is because I have a {$0.00} cent balance on the principal. Shellpoint/New Rez and I entered into an agreement to keep my mortgage at {$0.00} cents so that I did not have to pay back the remaining balance until I passed or the property was sold. Since that agreement they have not been able to process my payments. The LOAN HISTORY STATEMENT has them listed as UNAPPLIED PAYMENTS. As a result of this I receive monthly calls from the debt collection dept saying that I am behind in my payments. When this occurs I ask them to look at the account and see that I have made the payment. I usually receive an apology and a promise that the error will be corrected. The following month I receive another call from the debt collections dept. This has been the situation for over 5 years now. Around 3 years ago I had XXXX XXXX XXXX and was not able to handle the Debt call from them. As a result they attempted to foreclose on the property. By the time I was better they had added the {$4300.00} attorney fees to the balance. I attempted in writing and phone to have them removed. I have requested that they send me proof that I had missed any payments. What they have sent me is The Loan History Statement. The statement shows over XXXX occasions where the payment was made but is listed as UNAPPLIED.

I have attached a copy of my loan history statement.

2024-12-14,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"Upon speaking with the Vermont Attorney Generals Office, I was advised to contact you to submit this formal complaint to bring to your attention the inhumane and unfair practices of Wells Fargo Mortgage Service, which have caused significant distress and hardship following my husbands passing. 

My husband and I have held several mortgages with Wells Fargo in the past. Our most recent mortgage was taken out in XX/XX/year>. At that time, we were advised by the institution not to include my name on the mortgage note, as I was not working. Trusting their guidance, we proceeded. However, our attorney at the XX/XX/year> closing expressed concern about this arrangement, particularly regarding potential issues if anything were to happen to my husband. At his insistence, I signed the mortgage during the closing, and my name is also on the deed. We believed this resolved any concerns. 
For nine years, we paid the mortgage without issue. After my husbands passing, I continued to make payments via the online account. However, in XXXX, after paying the XXXX installment, I called Wells Fargo to ask a question and mentioned my husbands passing. I was transferred to the "" Life Events '' department and informed that I no longer had access to the account. 
This marked the beginning of an ongoing nightmare : 1. Locked Out of Online Access : Despite my continued payments, my online access was revoked, and I was directed to call the Life Events department. They promised to send information on my options, but this was either not sent or sent to an outdated address, despite my efforts to correct my contact information. 

2. Insensitivity and Miscommunication : Representatives repeatedly called my late husbands phone, leaving messages for him. When I expressed frustration, I was treated with a lack of empathy, accused ( in a loud and harsh tone ) of using my deceased husband to access his account, and subjected to condescending remarks.

3. Unreasonable Fees for Mortgage Assumption : The initial several phone calls led me to believe that assuming the mortgage would simply require me to qualify and assume the same rate. It wasnt until much later that I was informed that I could assume the mortgage for a nominal fee. After being very evasive and hearing multiple stories, this turned out to be over {$11000.00}. I was also offered the option to refinance at a significantly higher interest rate, which I declined as it was financially unreasonable.

4. Inaccessibility of Payment Options : Without online access, I was told to pay in person at the nearest Wells Fargo branchover three hours awayor mail payments, which my attorney strongly advised against due to concerns about check fraud. On multiple occasions, I drove over six hours round trip to make payments in person, only to encounter errors in how the payments were applied. XXXX payment is already wrong, and funds have repeatedly been misapplied to different months and the principal. Without access to an online account, it is impossible to keep track of the payments and confirm they have applied they have been applied correctly. 

5. Rude and Unhelpful Customer Service : A bank rep asked me on the phone whether or not I could even pay the mortgage in a condescending tone and told me to just pay it off at once, which is not her place. During one visit, a representative assured me the payment was correctly applied but later admitted it was not, requiring a case to be opened. The lack of attention to detail and accountability has been deeply frustrating and time-consuming.

The treatment I have received as a grieving widow and senior citizen is unacceptable.

The death of a spouse is one of the most difficult life events, and Wells Fargo has compounded my distress through mismanagement, lack of transparency, and disrespect.

Additionally, I am concerned about possible fraudulent practices. Our copy of the mortgage documentation indicates that I signed the mortgage ( see the provided XXXX  - XXXX ), but Wells Fargo appears to have obscured this information. This raises serious questions about their integrity and compliance. 

Attached to this complaint, you will find documentation supporting my claims, including evidence of my signature on the mortgage, records of my payments, a copy of a check I made for a second down payment on the home, and correspondence with Wells Fargo representatives. 

Vermont is a right-of-survivorship state so long as the couple is married and residing together in the home at the time of death, which was the case with my husband and me at his time of death. 

I am simply asking for reasonable and consistent access to make payments on my mortgage without the undue burden of excessive fees or unnecessary travel. Wells Fargos conduct has caused me significant emotional stress, and I urge the CFPB to investigate these practices.

Its been over a week, they take 2-3 days to return phone calls. I answered all the questions they have asked and I have submitted all documents they requested.

Robinhood refuses to let me withdraw or access the funds, refuses to solve the problem. And this is RIGHT BEFORE XXXX. 

The Robinhood companies THEFT of my funds, as thats what it is when you refuse to let a customer access, withdraw or spend their money. This theft has ruined a business vacation I am currently on. 

just like XXXX  when Robinhood cheated the system and turned off buy buttons to manipulate the market to move prices lower. Now the company is stealing and freezing customer funds. These reports are all over the Internet. Maybe the company has a liquidity issue or is going to go bankrupt but WHATEVER is wrong. This theft of customer funds is ridiculous.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., I have the right to accurate and complete information in my credit reports. I believe the information regarding this charge-off account is inaccurate and/or incomplete, and I request an immediate investigation into this matter. 

XXXX XXXX Account # : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Account # : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Account # : XXXX Applicable Legal Basis for Dispute 1. Verification Requirement ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) : - The FCRA mandates that all disputed information be verified within 30 days of a consumers dispute. If the information can not be verified, it must be corrected or deleted.

2. Obligation of Accuracy ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) : - Consumer reporting agencies must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports. The inaccurate or unverifiable information regarding the charge-off account violates this requirement.

3. Re-Aging of Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) : - The FCRA prohibits re-aging of old debt. If the date of first delinquency is inaccurately reported, the charge-off may appear on my credit report longer than the allowed 7 years.

4. Validation of Debt ( Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) : - Under the FDCPA, if the debt is being collected by a third party, I have the right to request validation of the debt, including proof of ownership and the amount owed.

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To Whom It XXXX Concern, I am filing a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate reporting of an account on my credit report, which I am requesting be removed entirely. The account in question is a XXXX  account, where I was listed as an authorized user. Below are the account details : Account Name : XXXX  Account Number : [ If available, you can include the last XXXX digits of the account number here ] Reported Balance : {$5200.00} Last Reported Date : XX/XX/XXXX Credit Limit : {$2100.00} Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Account Closed : XX/XX/XXXX The issue at hand is that this account was reported as closed with a balance of {$5200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, despite my role as an authorized user and not the primary account holder. Furthermore, the dispute resolved status showing "" subscriber disagrees '' is entirely inaccurate. As an authorized user, I do not hold responsibility for the balance, and the statement is misleading. 

I request the immediate removal of this account from my credit report. The account has been inaccurately reported, and its inclusion is harmful to my XXXX XXXX and financial well-being. 

Legal Basis for Request : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section XXXX ( a ), furnishers of credit information are required to provide accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies. The current reporting of this account violates the FCRA in the following ways : Inaccurate Reporting : The account was reported as a closed account with an outstanding balance. As an authorized user, I have no legal responsibility for the balance, and this should be reflected in the reporting. 

Dispute Status : The "" subscriber disagrees '' status is inaccurate and misleading. This indicates a dispute that I did not initiate or resolve, which is a violation of the FCRA 's requirement for accurate information. 

Failure to Correct Information : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies and furnishers correct any inaccuracies in a timely manner. The failure to accurately report the account as authorized user status rather than primary account holder is a violation of this obligation. 

Due to these violations, I am requesting that this entire account be removed from my credit report. The incorrect reporting of this account has caused significant harm to my credit and financial standing. 

Potential Legal Action : Should this matter not be resolved in a timely manner, I will consider pursuing legal action for damages under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as I have suffered harm due to inaccurate reporting. Under the FCRA, I am entitled to seek compensatory damages, including actual damages, statutory damages, and punitive damages for the failure to accurately report my credit information. 

I will also explore the option of engaging an attorney who specializes in consumer protection law and credit reporting disputes. A law firm such as The Law Offices of XXXX XXXX XXXX, which specializes in credit report disputes, FCRA violations, and consumer protection, can assist with this matter and pursue appropriate legal remedies if necessary.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,782XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11153591

I kindly request that your offices investigate this matter and take appropriate action against XXXX XXXX XXXX for their non-compliance with the FCRA. It is essential for consumers to be protected from inaccurate reporting that can negatively impact their creditworthiness.

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/year> Basis for Dispute Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) states that I have the right to dispute any inaccurate or incomplete information on my credit report. I request that you investigate these unauthorized inquiries and remove them from my credit report.

Section 609 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) grants me the right to access all information in my file, including the inquiries made. After reviewing this information, I firmly believe that the inquiries listed above should not be on my report.

Section 604 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ) defines the permissible purposes for obtaining credit reports. I did not give my consent for these inquiries to be made, and I can not find a permissible purpose under this section that justifies their presence on my report. 
Request I request an immediate investigation into the listed inquiries. If it is determined that these inquiries were made without my authorization or in error, I ask that they be removed from my credit report. I also request that you provide me with an updated copy of my credit report once the necessary corrections have been made.

Enclosed is a copy of my identification to verify my identity.

Despite submitting an identity theft report, a copy of my state-issued ID, and other supporting documentation, TransUnion continues to report a fraudulent and unauthorized account on my credit file instead of removing or blocking it, as required by law. I have repeatedly requested documentation showing how TransUnion verified the legitimacy of the account, including a copy of the original credit application with my signature, the address associated with the account at the time it was opened, and the identity of the representative from XXXXXXXX XXXX with whom TransUnion confirmed the account. TransUnion has failed to provide this information. 

Instead, I have been sent multiple identical letterssometimes up to five in a single daystating the account has been verified. These generic responses do not address my concerns or provide any proof of verification as mandated by the FCRA. This demonstrates a clear disregard for the proper procedures required when handling disputed fraudulent accounts and a failure to protect consumers from the impact of identity theft.

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"XXXX XXXX claimed they charged off the accounts but also gave me a time frame to make the payments before the accounts went to charge off I have emails and letters to prove this. Also I am writing to formally dispute the reporting and handling of my account with XXXX XXXX ( Account Number : [ Insert Account Number ] ). Your company has reported this account as charged off, yet you continue to send me correspondence demanding payment. Additionally, you have failed to issue a XXXX Cancellation of Debt form, as required when an account is deemed uncollectible or charged off.

This situation raises serious concerns regarding compliance with both federal and Ohio state laws. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ), any information reported to credit bureaus must be accurate, complete, and not misleading. Reporting this account as charged off while simultaneously pursuing payment creates an inaccurate and inconsistent narrative that violates this requirement. Furthermore, failure to issue a XXXX under these circumstances may constitute noncompliance with IRS regulations ( 26 U.S. Code 6050P ), which mandate that creditors report canceled debts of {$600.00} or more. 

Ohios Consumer Sales Practices Act ( Ohio Revised Code 1345.01 et seq. ) prohibits deceptive or unfair practices in consumer transactions. The ongoing attempts to collect on an account you have reported as charged off mislead me and potentially other consumers regarding the true status of the debt. 

In light of these discrepancies, I am requesting the following : 1. Verification of the status of the account. If the account is legitimately charged off, you must cease all collection activities and issue a XXXX form for the canceled debt, as required by law. 
2. Immediate removal of this account from my credit report if you can not verify the accuracy of the charge-off status.

3. A written explanation of why you are continuing to demand payment despite claiming the account is charged off.

XXXX knew they sold me a lemon to begin with and for them not be willing to fix the transmission and demand the car payments is not right at all. XXXX says the balance on the vehicle loan is {$13000.00} however to replace the transmission on my own would have cost me over {$4000.00} and I don't have that kind of money and is unable to keep up. I asked what else could be done since I could no longer drive the car since the transmission went out and I could no longer keep up with the payments due to financial hardship. XXXX said there was nothing they could do and allowed the car to sit outside of my house for 3 months on purpose so they can put it on my credit as a repossession and put a negative impact on my credit report. After going back and forth with XXXX I asked for my 1099-C to show the debt has been cancelled on their end and they wrote it off as income. When I finally received the 1099-C it does not have my correct address on it. I called XXXX to get answers they told me that I can put the 1099-C on my taxes however they did not mail me a new 1099-C with my correct address which would cause issues. XXXX told me I still owed the debt and the 1099-C form really doesn't mean anything anymore and it can not be used to remove the negative mark on my credit report and the 1099-C is only for my records. I have never lived at the address listed on the 1099-C. The date of identifiable event on the 1099-C is incorrect ; XXXX has XXXX as XX/XX/XXXX however they came and got the none working vehicle in XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX  is identifiable event code ( G ) meaning XXXX made the decision to discontinue collection to pursue payment. XXXX never changed the address on the 1099-C because I never received an updated one which causes a discrepancy with the credit bureaus when I submitted the 1099-C to XXXX, XXXX, and Transunion and filed disputes XXXX all three credit bureaus told me they spoke to XXXX and XXXX told them not to remove the negative mark and all the information on the 1099-C is accurate and that is not correct. I just checked my credit reports and all three credit bureaus have the XXXX negative mark to fall off XXXX of XXXX and it says XXXX XXXX. Which means they came and got the vehicle in XXXX ; because XXXX will be 7 years and by law the credit bureaus have to remove it from my credit report.

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"Dear CFPB, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request an investigation into the procedures employed by the major credit reporting agenciesTransUnion, XXXX, and XXXXregarding the accuracy of information reported on my credit file. I am concerned about certain inaccuracies that I have identified and the subsequent failure of these agencies to provide adequate responses and documentation, which I believe constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Background Recently, I submitted complaints to TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX regarding incorrect information reported on my credit reports. Despite my efforts to address these inaccuracies, I have not received satisfactory responses or valid proof of the claims made by these agencies. Most importantly, I have repeatedly requested to review the "" Procedures of Accuracy '' that these agencies claim to use to verify the information in my reports. Thus far, I have not received any meaningful information or documentation in response to my requests. 

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) The FCRA outlines specific responsibilities for credit reporting agencies, including the requirement to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Below are specific violations of the FCRA that I believe warrant your investigation : 1. Section 607 ( b ) - Reasonable Procedures : Credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. I have doubts that TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX have adhered to this requirement in my case, as the inaccuracies I reported have not been corrected nor explained.

2. Section 611 - Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy : Upon receiving my dispute, these agencies are mandated to conduct a reasonable investigation of my claims within 30 days. I submitted my dispute to all three agencies, but they have failed to provide the required investigation results or documentation supporting the accuracy of the reported information. Their lack of response is a clear violation of this section.

3. Failure to Validate Debts : When I identified the inaccuracies, I requested that the agencies provide validation of the debts and the procedures they used to verify the informations accuracy. Under the FCRA, they are obligated to provide this information and their failure to do so represents another violation of my consumer rights.

4. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - Duty of Furnishers of Information : Any entity that provides information to consumer reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy of that information. If the information provided is found to be inaccurate, the furnishers have a duty to correct it. I am concerned that the agencies are not holding these furnishers accountable for the inaccurate reporting.

5. Lack of Adequate Consumer Responses : The agencies have not provided timely or useful responses to my inquiries, which I believe underlines a broader failure to protect consumer rights as mandated by the FCRA. 

Request for Action Given the collective issues I have faced, I respectfully ask the CFPB to conduct a thorough investigation into the practices of TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX regarding how they handle inaccuracies and disputes. Furthermore, I urge your office to compel these agencies to provide their "" Procedures of Accuracy '' and ensure they are compliant with the FCRA requirements.

As a consumer, I have the right to accurate credit reporting, and the current situation jeopardizes my financial health and fundamental rights. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response. 



I am writing to you to formally request a copy of the procedure your company followed in order to ensure that the information reporting for account XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX is completely accurate.It 's strange, you did a full investigation to verify the accuracy of this account due to the fact that you continue to report the wrong information. 

It is frightening to think that you did not do as you are governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act andthat other consumer might be affected Having this type of information on a person'sa credit report is unfortunate and severely damaging, but having incorrect damaging information ona person 's credit report is unacceptable. 

Please forward to me the name of the person you spoke with atINQUIRY, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, INQUIRY, INQUIRY, INQUIRY and the date that you spoke with them. I also want a confirmation of the address and phone number for the company. 

INQUIRY - XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, INQUIRY - XX/XX/XXXX, INQUIRY - XX/XX/XXXX, INQUIRY - XX/XX/XXXX As I have said, this account is incorrect and should be deleted entirely.

Per my divorce decree, the timeshares listed on my credit reports are to be the sole property of my ex-husband. Specifically, under the section titled ** '' Additional Clauses '' **, the decree states : * '' In regards to timeshares purchased during the marriage, ALL timeshares will become the sole property of ( my ex husband ). ( ex wife, Me ) will be held harmless of any matters regarding these properties. "" * Despite multiple
disputes submitted to TransUnion and XXXX, these timeshares remain inaccurately reported on my credit reports. This misreporting is causing significant harm to my consumer profile and is severely limiting my ability to secure credit and financing opportunities. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have attached the following supporting documentation to this complaint for your review : 1. A copy of my divorce decree.

2. A copy of my ID.

3. Proof of address.

4. A copy of the disputed account reporting to TransUnion and XXXX. 

I respectfully request the CFPB 's assistance in ensuring that these timeshare accounts are promptly removed from my consumer credit reports as they no longer pertain to me under the terms of my divorce decree.

3. Ensuring that the information is corrected to reflect accurate and complete data as required by the FCRA.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2.

Being a victim of identity theft due to a data breach, I am invoking my rights to have inaccurate information removed from my credit file.

Nature of the Issue : As a result of the data breach and subsequent misuse of my Social Security Number ( SSN ) and other sensitive details, I identified unauthorized accounts and transactions on my credit report. These fraudulent entries have harmed my credit profile, as demonstrated by a recent credit denial from my financial institution.

The items I am disputing and requesting to be blocked are XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  U S DEPT OF ED XXXX Supporting Documentation : I have included the following documentation to substantiate my dispute : A copy of my original dispute letter sent to TransUnion, XXXX and XXXX. 

A copy of my government-issued ID and Social Security card for identity verification.

A copy of my Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report.

Legal Basis for the Request : Under FCRA Section 605B, credit reporting agencies must block the reporting of information linked to identity theft within four ( 4 ) business days after receiving the consumers dispute and accompanying evidence. Additionally, 15 USC 1681c-2 ( a ) requires these agencies to ensure such data is excluded from the consumers credit report and that furnishers of the fraudulent accounts are notified of the block.

If further information or action is needed from me to resolve this issue, please inform me right away.

Thank you for addressing this matter promptly.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2.

Both of my Paypal accounts show a long history of unauthorized transactions which I have tried to identify and report to Paypal also on XX/XX/2024. Although I opened two other Cases to report the older unauthorized transactions to Paypal, I understand that they are not obligated to investigate unauthorized transactions that appear on statements issued 60 days or more from the date of the reporting.

Paypal claims that all transactions on my accounts have been authorized, the ones that have occurred in the past 40 days and the older transactions. They have not requested any information from me and refuse to budge from their claim.

I have told Paypal multiple times that I have not made the transactions ; that I have not allowed anyone to make them on my behalf ; that I did not give anybody my login information or access to my accounts, and that the transactions must have been done fraudulently.

Paypal has not asked me to provide any information. They closed XXXX XXXX on the same day that I reported the issue and just keep parroting that they have found no evidence of unauthorized use or access of my Paypal account and that the transactions from Case XXXX are consistent with the history of transactions on the same Paypal account. Anytime I bring up the issue of fraud, they completely gloss over it and just repeat the same lines about having found no evidence of unauthorized use or access of my Paypal account.

Paypal clearly does not want to seriously investigate the possibility of fraud. At the same time, they also restricted my accounts after I reported the unauthorized transactions. It has been more than 10 days since I reported the unauthorized transactions to Paypal, they have refused to investigate the fraud on my accounts and they seem to have also refused to refund me.",,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",VA,20147,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11159554
2024-12-14,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,,"Comprehensive Complaint Document Subject : Fraudulent Transactions, Collusion, and Unlawful Conduct by Robinhood Markets , Inc. and XXXX Summary of Allegations This complaint details incidents of fraud, collusion, and obstruction by Robinhood Markets , Inc. ( Robinhood ) and XXXX. Their unlawful conduct has violated both federal and California state laws, causing significant financial and emotional harm. 

Detailed Allegations XXXX. Widespread Fraud Confirmed by Other Institutions Initial Incident : The complainants phone and wallet were stolen, resulting in unauthorized access to multiple accounts, including XXXX, XXXX, and other services. These incidents were reported to the police and the FTC. 
Financial institutions, including XXXX  XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX, investigated these fraudulent transactions, ruled in favor of the complainant, and refunded the stolen funds. 
XXXX. PayPals Role in Collusion and Admission of Fraud Collusion and Forged Evidence : XXXX initially colluded with Robinhood and XXXX, submitting fraudulent and forged evidence designed to make it appear as though the complainant authorized the transactions. 
The evidence provided contained glaring inconsistencies that were impossible to reconcile with reality, including fabricated transaction details and altered account records. 
These red flags were promptly recognized by XXXX  XXXX XXXX and credit card companies, who flagged the documentation as fraudulent. 
Attempt to Block Access to Evidence : When the complainant pressed XXXX for documentation of the disputed transactions, XXXX attempted to withhold access. 
XXXX falsely asserted that the complainant was not entitled to the documents unless a formal written request had been made. 
The complainant reminded XXXX that such a request had already been submitted. 
Admission of Fraud : XXXX ultimately admitted its role in facilitating fraudulent transactions. During a call, which the complainant conducted through their bank to ensure transparency, XXXX apologized and returned the stolen funds. 
XXXX openly acknowledged that the complainants access to BofA documentation exposed XXXX wrongdoing, with XXXX representatives stating that the complainant wasnt supposed to get these documents. 
XXXX. Robinhood and XXXX Obstruction and Blame-Shifting Failure to Investigate : Despite XXXX admitting to its role in facilitating fraudulent transactions, Robinhood and XXXX refused to resolve the disputed transactions. 
Both companies repeatedly shifted blame onto the complainant, violating Regulation E ( Electronic Fund Transfer Act ), which prohibits transferring liability for unauthorized transactions to consumers. 
Harassment During Investigation : Robinhood representatives called the complainant several times with hostile, unprofessional questioning regarding device access and locations. 
On XXXX date, they claimed fraudulent access had occurred from an XXXX, which the complainant does not own. 
On another date, they referenced a XXXX XXXX XXXX, which the complainant also does not own. 
When Robinhood mentioned a date matching the complainants actual device, the complainant offered to verify their XXXX location history to provide accurate information. Instead of accepting this effort, Robinhood representatives became agitated, demanded the complainant just guess their location, and accused them of being difficult. 
XXXX Threats and Intimidation : XXXX customer support threatened to block the complainant from further assistance, accusing them of monopolizing support resources. 
XXXX repeatedly claimed to have refunded stolen funds but directed those refunds to inaccessible accounts, despite knowing the original accounts were closed. 
XXXX actions directly violate laws requiring refunds to be issued to accounts accessible to the consumer. 
XXXX. Unauthorized Liquidation of Assets by Robinhood Unauthorized Actions : Robinhood liquidated the complainants stocks and cryptocurrency holdings without consent. 
The timing of these sales appeared intentional, as assets were sold at depressed values, maximizing financial harm. 
Avoidance of Accountability : I have provided XXXX the details where to send my money, but they claim they are trying to complay but can only send to the XXXX account. They take days and weeks to responds stating they are waiting on thier "" partner '' to inform them what to do. AKA robinhood. This shows clear and convincing evidence of collusion. A felony crime under CA and FED laws. 
Instead of transferring proceeds to an accessible account, Robinhood withheld the funds and created unnecessary delays, compounding financial harm. 
XXXX. Unlawful Contractual Terms Robinhoods user agreement imposes additional liability on consumers, beyond what is permitted under Regulation E.

The company unlawfully required the complainant to meet arbitrary conditions before reimbursing stolen funds. These practices violate federal consumer protections. 
XXXX. Intentional Obstruction and Emotional Distress Robinhood and XXXX refusal to provide timely investigations, necessary documentation, or refunds caused : Prolonged financial instability. 
Significant emotional distress. 
Both companies demonstrated willful intent to avoid accountability and harm the complainant. 
Supporting Evidence Rulings by Other Financial Institutions : XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX  all ruled in the complainants favor, confirmed the fraud, and refunded the stolen funds. 
Obstruction by Robinhood and XXXX : Robinhood blocked XXXX refunds and misrepresented facts, falsely citing account closures to delay resolution. 
Both companies manipulated transaction records and provided misleading information to regulators. 
Violations of Regulation E : Both Robinhood and XXXX blatantly ignored consumer protections afforded under federal law. 
Legal Violations Federal Violations Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) : Prohibits transferring liability for unauthorized transactions to consumers. 
XXXX XXXX ( 18 U.S.C. 1343 ) : Fraudulent schemes involving electronic communications. 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) ( 18 U.S.C. 1962 ) : Demonstrated pattern of fraudulent and obstructive behavior. 
California State Violations California Civil Code 3336 : Recovery of damages for wrongful conversion of property.

Unfair Competition Law ( UCL ) : Prohibits deceptive, fraudulent, and unfair business practices.

Consumer Legal Remedies Act ( CLRA ) : Protects against unlawful and deceptive practices in consumer transactions.

Requested Remedies Full Restitution : Immediate reimbursement of all unauthorized transactions and asset liquidations.

Financial Compensation : Compensation for financial losses and emotional distress caused by Robinhood and XXXX unlawful actions. 
Refund Handling Compliance : Require XXXX to process refunds to accessible accounts, as mandated by law. 
Revised Contractual Terms : Termination of unlawful terms in Robinhoods user agreement that shift liability to consumers. 
Transparency in Investigations : Require Robinhood to provide all documentation, evidence, and findings related to the fraudulent transactions. 
Resolution Deadline Robinhood and XXXX must : THE SEC has told them to resolve the claim and inform them of the resolution ; but they both still play games. They have held my my funds froze my accounts. They owe me {$280000.00} for actual damages, punitive and pain and suffering plus interest this has gone on for months now and they refuse to cooperate even with intervention. they laugh at me and mock me. They think this is all so funny. I got an annoynmous call from an ex employee who claimed they do this on purpose to pay for the fines they were issued by the government and they pick on people who they think will go away. I have gotten calls from numbers in washington DC claiming to be XXXX telling me to download and app to my phone so they can protect me but it is clearly a fake name and they have forigen accents. I think it is a trick to try to say it is my fault I fell for scams. They broke every rule in thier investigation and it is totally unfair. 


Conclusion This complaint seeks immediate resolution, restitution, and accountability for the unlawful actions of Robinhood and XXXX.

The mortgage was held by NewRez LLC DBA Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. "" NewRez '' was not able to locate the proprietary lease for my co-op, thereby delaying the closing from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, and causing us to unnecessarily pay {$1300.00} in interest to them through thru XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I verbally accepted an offer to sell this co-op and on XX/XX/XXXX we retained a closing attorney. The atty began working with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), a law firm who represents NewRez in New York XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my atty provided XXXX with a form I signed authorizing NewRez to locate my stock certificate and priority lease for the closing. NewRez immediately confirmed receipt of that form and warning that turnaround time would be XXXX weeks. 

My atty emailed XXXX for a status of the stock certificate and priority lease on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX responded, saying that they received our file from NewRez but the proprietary lease was missing. 

It took until XX/XX/XXXX for NewRez to confirm they could not locate the proprietary lease. They then prepared a Lost Proprietary Lease Affidavit for approval by the co-op transfer agent. Thus, closing dates could not even be discussed until then and XX/XX/XXXX became the first closing date all partied were available. 

I would like to also note that NewRez 's inability to keep track of my lease also caused me to incur {$1400.00} in co-op fees for the month of XXXX. 

Federal law requires mortgage companies to provide pay-off figures within seven business days of a written request. Thus, I am sure you will agree it is unreasonable that we had to wait *eleven* weeks after alerting New Rez that were selling this co-op to pay off this 8 % mortgage.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",MA,024XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11156850

PRIVACY Title 15 U.S. Code 6801 states, It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information, and that the financial institution shall protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Synchrony Bank is a financial institution by definition in this Title, and its failure to abide by privacy laws has both harmed and inconvenienced me. 

I provided opt out instructions to Synchrony Bank on XX/XX/year> via the online messaging center in my accounts portal ( Attachment 1 ). My instructions were not complied with, as evidenced by Attachments 2, 3, and 4, which are consumer reports showing my account information reported after the date of my opt out notice. Synchrony Bank/Sams continued to report my personal information after receiving my opt out notice, which violated my consumer privacy rights.

The furnishing of my information after that date is unlawful and is required to be removed ; inclusive of, but not limited to, balances, amounts, late payments, status, remarks, comments, highest balance, updated dates, last payment dates, etc. 

FAIR REPORTING Additionally, Synchrony Bank furnished information to credit reporting agencies while the account balance was still in dispute ( as evidenced by Attachments 5 and 6 ), which is a violation of the fair credit reporting 15 USC 1681s-2. Consequent to Synchrony Banks unlawful actions, I was denied when applying for a loan recently ( Attachment 7 ).

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"Dear CFPB, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request an investigation into the procedures employed by the major credit reporting agenciesXXXX, Equifax, and XXXXregarding the accuracy of information reported on my credit file. I am concerned about certain inaccuracies that I have identified and the subsequent failure of these agencies to provide adequate responses and documentation, which I believe constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Background Recently, I submitted complaints to XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX regarding incorrect information reported on my credit reports. Despite my efforts to address these inaccuracies, I have not received satisfactory responses or valid proof of the claims made by these agencies. Most importantly, I have repeatedly requested to review the "" Procedures of Accuracy '' that these agencies claim to use to verify the information in my reports. Thus far, I have not received any meaningful information or documentation in response to my requests. 

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) The FCRA outlines specific responsibilities for credit reporting agencies, including the requirement to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Below are specific violations of the FCRA that I believe warrant your investigation : 1. Section 607 ( b ) - Reasonable Procedures : Credit reporting agencies are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. I have doubts that XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX have adhered to this requirement in my case, as the inaccuracies I reported have not been corrected nor explained.

2. Section 611 - Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy : Upon receiving my dispute, these agencies are mandated to conduct a reasonable investigation of my claims within 30 days. I submitted my dispute to all three agencies, but they have failed to provide the required investigation results or documentation supporting the accuracy of the reported information. Their lack of response is a clear violation of this section.

3. Failure to Validate Debts : When I identified the inaccuracies, I requested that the agencies provide validation of the debts and the procedures they used to verify the informations accuracy. Under the FCRA, they are obligated to provide this information and their failure to do so represents another violation of my consumer rights.

4. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - Duty of Furnishers of Information : Any entity that provides information to consumer reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy of that information. If the information provided is found to be inaccurate, the furnishers have a duty to correct it. I am concerned that the agencies are not holding these furnishers accountable for the inaccurate reporting.

5. Lack of Adequate Consumer Responses : The agencies have not provided timely or useful responses to my inquiries, which I believe underlines a broader failure to protect consumer rights as mandated by the FCRA. 

Request for Action Given the collective issues I have faced, I respectfully ask the CFPB to conduct a thorough investigation into the practices of XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX regarding how they handle inaccuracies and disputes. Furthermore, I urge your office to compel these agencies to provide their "" Procedures of Accuracy '' and ensure they are compliant with the FCRA requirements. 

As a consumer, I have the right to accurate credit reporting, and the current situation jeopardizes my financial health and fundamental rights. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response. 



I am writing to you to formally request a copy of the procedure your company followed in order to ensure that the information reporting for account XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX is completely accurate.It 's strange, you did a full investigation to verify the accuracy of this account due to the fact that you continue to report the wrong information. 

It is frightening to think that you did not do as you are governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act andthat other consumer might be affected Having this type of information on a person'sa credit report is unfortunate and severely damaging, but having incorrect damaging information ona person 's credit report is unacceptable.

Be advised this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act 15 USC 1692 ( g ). This claim is being disputed and a debt validation is requested.

False or misleading representations as defined ( 3 ) The false representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney. This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title and Section. After the case with XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Consumer Federal Protection Bureaus ( CFPB ) took action against XXXX XXXX XXXX to their illegal debt collection and credit reporting practices. XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect on disputed debts using unlawful collection letters and misrepresentation. The CFPB stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect debt that was NOT substantiated after consumers disputed the validity of the debt conducted an investigation and found that XXXX sent collection letters to consumers who DISPUTED the validity or accuracy of their purported debts, even though XXXX had NOT obtained substantiation for the debts. As a debt collection, the CFPB states you are required to have a reasonable basis for assertion that a consumer owes the purported debt if a dispute is submitted. As a result, the CFPB required XXXX XXXX XXXX to pay redress to affected consumer and pay a {$1.00} XXXX penalty to the CFPBs victim relief fund.

Ally Financial knowingly participated in a scheme involving fraudulent debt instruments, related to a car purchase in XXXX. These actions constitute a deliberate and egregious violation of my rights as a consumer and federal statutes. 

Specific Allegations XXXX. Fraudulent Debt Instruments Ally Financial has sought to collect a debt based on contracts I allege are fraudulent. These contracts rely on banking practices designed to impose unpayable obligations, thereby creating a predictable cycle of default. 

XXXX. Knowledge of Fraudulent Activity I provided Ally Financial with substantial evidence contesting the debts legitimacy, including affidavits and detailed correspondence. Despite this, they continued their collection efforts, demonstrating willful participation in a fraudulent scheme. 

XXXX. Violation of RICO Statute Ally Financials actions constitute the collection of unlawful debt under 18 U.S.C. 1962 ( c ). Their persistent attempts to enforce a fraudulent contract reflect a pattern of racketeering activity, meeting the legal definition under the RICO Act.

Why the Debt Collection is Unlawful Ally Financials debt collection efforts are unlawful for the following reasons 4. Fabricated Loan and Lack of Lawful Consideration Ally Financial has refused to provide proof of lawful consideration for the loan upon request. Without this proof, it is reasonable to conclude that the alleged loan was fabricated on their balance sheet, meaning no real funds were ever extended to me. As a result, Ally Financial can not demonstrate that they suffered any actual loss and therefore have no legal standing to pursue debt collection or seek a remedy through this process.

5. Fraudulent and Predatory Practices The underlying debt is predicated on usurious banking practices that guarantee default, rendering the debt fraudulent and unenforceable.

6. Disregard for Evidence and Federal Law Despite being provided with clear evidence of the debts invalidity, Ally Financial persisted in its collection efforts, violating federal protections against predatory lending and unfair debt collection practices.

7. Violation of the RICO Statute By continuing to enforce an illegitimate obligation despite awareness of its fraudulent nature, Ally Financial engaged in actions prohibited under RICO.

Relevant Penalties Under RICO Under the RICO Act, individuals or organizations found guilty of racketeering activities face severe penalties, including : A maximum of 20 years in prison for those involved.

Fines up to {$250000.00} or double the amount of the proceeds derived from the criminal activity.

Enhanced sentences in cases of severe or ongoing violations.

These penalties underscore the gravity of Ally Financials actions and highlight the urgent need for enforcement.

Documentation of Evidence I can provide the following evidence upon request : Correspondence with Ally Financial disputing the debt. 
Affidavits challenging the debts validity. 
Documentation submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies regarding this matter.",,ALLY FINANCIAL INC.,PA,190XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11160687

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, MO. XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Complaint Against XXXX XXXX XXXX Regarding Improper Use of My Credit File To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX for violations of federal statutes related to the improper use of my credit file, reporting of information without consent, and failure to comply with legal obligations regarding debt reporting and income recognition. 
1. Unauthorized Use and Reporting of Credit Information : XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which specifies permissible purposes for obtaining and using consumer credit reports. I never provided written consent for XXXX XXXX XXXX to report any information to my credit file. According to 16 CFR 313.7, financial institutions must obtain explicit authorization from consumers before sharing nonpublic personal information unless an exception applies, none of which are applicable here. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX failed to do. Their actions also appear to violate 15 U.S.C. 6805, which empowers regulatory bodies to enforce these provisions. 
2. Charge-Off Reporting and Misclassification : A charge-off is a bookkeeping designation used by creditors for tax purposes when they consider a debt uncollectible. Under federal tax law, a charge-off can be treated as a cancellation of debt, which may constitute income to the debtor. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX did not issue a 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) form to me, as required under IRS regulations XXXX to substantiate that the debt was canceled and classified as income. Without this form, their reporting of the charge-off to credit reporting agencies is not only improper but also misleading. Moreover, a charge-off does not represent a valid certificate of indebtedness. A certificate of indebtedness reflects a binding obligation that is enforceable ; a charge-off, by its nature, implies that the debt has been resolved or abandoned by the creditor. Reporting a charge-off to credit bureaus under these circumstances constitutes inaccurate reporting. 
3. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : XXXX XXXX XXXX has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. 
I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 68026805 ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ). Additionally, I request clarification and appropriate remediation regarding : 1. The absence of a 1099-C form to substantiate the charge-off as canceled debt.

2. The improper classification of a charge-off as a certificate of indebtedness.

3. The unauthorized reporting of information to credit bureaus without my explicit written consent. Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

I look forward to your assistance in ensuring compliance and protecting my rights as a consumer.

repossess collateral under the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) is governed by Article 9 of the UCC, specifically UCC 47-9-609. This section outlines the rules and procedures for a creditor to repossess collateral when a debtor defaults on a secured transaction. According to Tennessee 's UCC 47-9-609, a creditor generally has the right to repossess collateral if the debtor has defaulted on the underlying obligation. However, having a lien on the collateral is a key requirement for the creditor to exercise the right to repossess. The creditor must have a security interest in the collateral, typically established through a security agreement or another means allowed under the UCC. Therefore, in Tennessee, to repossess collateral under the UCC, the creditor must have a valid security interest or lien in the collateral as outlined in the UCC rules. It is essential for creditors to follow the proper procedures outlined in the UCC to repossess collateral lawfully and avoid potential legal challenges from debtors. In Particular,
Inclearing deposits played a crucial role in the processing of auto loan payments affecting both lenders & borrowers. My auto home from Ally Financial was {$73000.00} & Ally Financial used the OC application form submitting it to the Federal Reserve Bank requesting {$350000.00}.

The rep I spoke with stated their was a {$0.00} account balance and the account was closed. I was relieved that I could finally terminate my relationship with CITI bank as they have been nothing but trouble and frustration. XX/XX/XXXX, I got several emails stating there was a hit to my XXXX score ( was at XXXX ) I've always had nearly perfect credit, but now there was a hit due an "" account being 30 days past due. I checked my XXXX, and any other accounts and all of them had a XXXX balance. Because they have been so horrid to deal with, the thought crossed my mind that it might be CITI bank. Of course it was. It said the statement balance was {$140.00}! I cut up the card in XXXX and have no used it since which means CITI bank LIED when he told me there was XXXX balance when I stated repeatedly I wanted to close the account and not deal with them anymore. When I called again to try and close my account, I got a representative who refused to issue me a statement in writing saying the account was closed and had a XXXX balance. This is in direct violation to THE CREDIT CARD REPORTING ACT of XXXX. When she escalated the call, I got an even worse representative named XXXX Employee # XXXX who also refused to sent a statement to me and just repeated herself over and over saying she was "" taking a payment but this did not include fees, interest, new charges '' etc... I had stated about XXXX times that I wanted to never deal with CITI bank XXXX, wanted to close my account, and wanted assurance there would be no need charges ( FEES ) attached to the card as I wasn't using it and cut it up back in XXXX. XXXX then said "" so I heard you never want to hear from us again? '' I said yes that was correct after the account was closed, and the balance was paid off. XXXX then put me on hold and came back and said "" okay I have removed you from any further communication with CITI bank ''. I knew exactly where she was going with her charade and said "" so if you guys tack on more hidden fees to an account I am trying to close, I won't be notified is that correct? '' She said "" yes ma'am, that's correct ''. That is not what I was trying to do, she was just playing games, then she told me she didn't like my tone ''. Then she asked me if I wanted her tl reverse the payement? It was obviously apparent XXXX was not interested in resolving anything. So abhorrent I was at a loss for words. I got a reference number for my payment which I used their automated system to make sure my statement remained at a {$0.00} balance, and will continue to do so as their reps can not be trusted. My fico score dropped XXXX points yesterday after dealing with them when it was THEIR rep who told me the account had a XXXX balance and it was closed in XXXX. When I told chayra all of this she stated she had "" no idea what was said by who etc ''. That's a complete lie, they have a running log of who talks to what client and what is said. I want my fico score back as this is a blatant abuse of fees, hidden charges, being lied to by CITI bank. I have a right as a consumer to recieve a copy of my statement for records to get piece of mind that I can severe ties with this atrocious company and never deal with them again.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",IL,60613,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11157411

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15

Being a victim of identity theft due to a data breach, I am invoking my rights to have inaccurate information removed from my credit file.

Nature of the Issue : As a result of the data breach and subsequent misuse of my Social Security Number ( SSN ) and other sensitive details, I identified unauthorized accounts and transactions on my credit report. These fraudulent entries have harmed my credit profile, as demonstrated by a recent credit denial from my financial institution. 

The items I am disputing and requesting to be blocked are : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Supporting Documentation : I have included the following documentation to substantiate my dispute : A copy of my original dispute letter sent to XXXX, Equifax and XXXX. 

A copy of my government-issued ID and Social Security card for identity verification.

A copy of my Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report.

Legal Basis for the Request : Under FCRA Section 605B, credit reporting agencies must block the reporting of information linked to identity theft within four ( 4 ) business days after receiving the consumers dispute and accompanying evidence. Additionally, 15 USC 1681c-2 ( a ) requires these agencies to ensure such data is excluded from the consumers credit report and that furnishers of the fraudulent accounts are notified of the block. 



If further information or action is needed from me to resolve this issue, please inform me right away. 

Thank you for addressing this matter promptly.

XXXX knew they sold me a lemon to begin with and for them not be willing to fix the transmission and demand the car payments is not right at all. XXXX says the balance on the vehicle loan is {$13000.00} however to replace the transmission on my own would have cost me over {$4000.00} and I don't have that kind of money and is unable to keep up. I asked what else could be done since I could no longer drive the car since the transmission went out and I could no longer keep up with the payments due to financial hardship. XXXX said there was nothing they could do and allowed the car to sit outside of my house for 3 months on purpose so they can put it on my credit as a repossession and put a negative impact on my credit report. After going back and forth with XXXX I asked for my 1099-C to show the debt has been cancelled on their end and they wrote it off as income. When I finally received the 1099-C it does not have my correct address on it. I called XXXX to get answers they told me that I can put the 1099-C on my taxes however they did not mail me a new 1099-C with my correct address which would cause issues. XXXX told me I still owed the debt and the 1099-C form really doesn't mean anything anymore and it can not be used to remove the negative mark on my credit report and the 1099-C is only for my records. I have never lived at the address listed on the 1099-C. The date of identifiable event on the 1099-C is incorrect ; XXXX has XXXX as XX/XX/XXXX however they came and got the none working vehicle in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is identifiable event code ( G ) meaning XXXX made the decision to discontinue collection to pursue payment. XXXX never changed the address on the 1099-C because I never received an updated one which causes a discrepancy with the credit bureaus when I submitted the 1099-C to XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX and filed disputes XXXX all three credit bureaus told me they spoke to XXXX and XXXX told them not to remove the negative mark and all the information on the 1099-C is accurate and that is not correct. I just checked my credit reports and all three credit bureaus have the XXXX negative mark to fall off XXXX of XXXX and it says Paid Off. Which means they came and got the vehicle in XXXX ; because XXXX will be 7 years and by law the credit bureaus have to remove it from my credit report. Also, since the credit bureaus have Paid off regarding this account it should not be on my credit report.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",IL,60411,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11156534

2024-12-14,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"I opened my first Sofi savings account on XX/XX/year>. At the time, the interest rate they were offering was 4.9 % ( now 4.0 % ), which was not the highest of anyone else, but still good. The additional incentive, and the reason why I went with Sofi, and not a competitor, was the {$300.00} bonus offered for {$5000.00} or more in direct deposits from employers, if received within 25 days. I have both a full-time, W-2 job and a part-time independent contractor job that pay me on a regular basis. By 10/25/24, I exceeded the {$5000.00} in DD 's within 25 days requirement.

But after the 25 days, Sofi only credited me {$50.00}, which is basically the bonus for anyone who meet the requirements for receiving the {$300.00}. I saw this and thought that it must be a mistake, so I contacted Sofi Customer Service. They said that they had created a case and needed two weeks to investigate my issue. Well, two weeks came and went, and there wasn't any follow-up from Sofi to me whatsoever. So I called in, and was told that the investigation had concluded and that I would not be receiving the {$300.00}. The reason given was that my payments from by contracting work looked more like payments than direct deposits (!!? ). Somehow, the payer 's bank had coded them differently from what Sofi wanted.

But I could prove that these were indeed payments for work performed. So Sofi asked me to send in a check stub equivalent, which I then did. The Accounts Manager who was referred to me then said that she would request an exception to their decision, and that I would see a credit "" within 1 to 3 business days. '' Well, those days also came and went, also with no follow-up received of any kind from Sofi. So I called in and learned that the appeal was also denied. Sofi continued to insist that the coding they received from the payer 's banker was all that mattered, and that the fact that they were effectively direct deposits for work performed wasn't sufficient.

I then told them that they were a dishonest and terrible company for doing this, and wasting my time and money. I then moved a large chunk of my account to a competitor who is paying a 5 % interest rate. But I've still kept my account at Sofi, and would appreciate some justice and honesty on my behalf, finally, in the form of Sofi making good on the {$300.00} that they owe me.",,"SOFI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",NC,27603,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11158636

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,33141,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11144285

XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2024 Subject : Complaint Against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Regarding Improper Use of My Credit File To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for violations of federal statutes related to the improper use of my credit file, reporting of information without consent, and failure to comply with legal obligations regarding debt reporting and income recognition. 
1. Unauthorized Use and Reporting of Credit Information : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which specifies permissible purposes for obtaining and using consumer credit reports. I never provided written consent for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to report any information to my credit file. According to 16 CFR 313.7, financial institutions must obtain explicit authorization from consumers before sharing nonpublic personal information unless an exception applies, none of which are applicable here. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 6802, financial institutions are required to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure of their information-sharing policies and practices, which XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to do. Their actions also appear to violate 15 U.S.C. 6805, which empowers regulatory bodies to enforce these provisions. 
2. Lack of Transparency and Consumer Rights Violations : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has disregarded my consumer rights by failing to provide adequate notice or obtain my written consent before furnishing information to credit reporting agencies. This omission violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ). Their noncompliance with transparency requirements and failure to respect the confidentiality of my personal financial information is concerning. I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX practices to determine whether they are in violation of federal laws, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 68026805 ( GLBAs financial privacy rules ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( FCRAs permissible purposes for credit reporting ) ; 16 CFR 313.7 ( GLBA privacy and opt-out regulations ). Additionally, I request clarification and appropriate remediation regarding : The unauthorized reporting of information to credit bureaus without my explicit written consent. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in ensuring compliance and protecting my rights as a consumer.

After I did not subscribe it has downgraded my credit score from XXXX to XXXX ( scores provided by a service called XXXX XXXX that I have subscribed to for many years, who told me they rely on Equifax for credit scores ). When I requested my credit report online Equifax says it is unavailable. When I called their telephone number and spoke to a human they said they can not tell me why my credit score has declined. 

I am asking you to ask Equifax to tell me why there has been such a huge decline in my credit score. I am up to date on my bills and have in excess of {$200000.00} in savings in XXXX and XXXX and in excess of {$5000.00} in savings and checking.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",CA,95210,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11147582

Despite following the appropriate steps to dispute these inquiries, Equifax has failed to take necessary action, provide adequate responses, or remove the unauthorized inquiries from my credit report. 

To dispute these inquiries I disputed online multiple times, I called into their fraud department, and sent all information via certified mail which they stated would be the way to get them removed. Equifax then failed to return the signed receipt confirming they received it. This also raises concerns about whether my documentation was even reviewed or investigated. Within that certified mail was : An FTC Identity Theft Report, A copy of my Social Security card, A copy of my government-issued identification, Proof of my address ( a utility bill ). 

Equifax failed to conduct a thorough investigation into my dispute.

I have encountered unresolved issues with my credit report that I have attempted to address through the dispute process but have not received a satisfactory resolution. 

Despite submitting multiple disputes and providing the necessary documentation to correct inaccuracies on my credit file, I have yet to see any meaningful progress in resolving these matters. Specifically, I am dissatisfied with the ongoing failure to address the discrepancies and the repeated letters stating that my credit profile can not be located, which I believe is unacceptable and does not comply with applicable laws. 

Given that these issues have remained unresolved and in accordance with the arbitration agreement, I am now taking the necessary steps to attempt an amicable resolution before proceeding with arbitration. This letter serves as my formal request to initiate the pre-arbitration process in good faith, and I seek to resolve this matter promptly. 

Please confirm receipt of this letter and provide further instructions on the next steps in this pre-arbitration process. If additional documentation or information is needed to proceed, I am happy to provide it.

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To Whom It XXXX Concern, I am filing a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate reporting of an account on my credit report, which I am requesting be removed entirely. The account in question is a XXXX account, where I was listed as an authorized user. Below are the account details : Account Name : XXXX Account Number : [ If available, you can include the last XXXX digits of the account number here ] Reported Balance : {$5200.00} Last Reported Date : XX/XX/XXXX Credit Limit : {$2100.00} Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Account Closed : XX/XX/XXXX The issue at hand is that this account was reported as closed with a balance of {$5200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, despite my role as an authorized user and not the primary account holder. Furthermore, the dispute resolved status showing "" subscriber disagrees '' is entirely inaccurate. As an authorized user, I do not hold responsibility for the balance, and the statement is misleading. 

I request the immediate removal of this account from my credit report. The account has been inaccurately reported, and its inclusion is harmful to my credit score and financial well-being. 

Legal Basis for Request : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section XXXX ( a ), furnishers of credit information are required to provide accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies. The current reporting of this account violates the FCRA in the following ways : Inaccurate Reporting : The account was reported as a closed account with an outstanding balance. As an authorized user, I have no legal responsibility for the balance, and this should be reflected in the reporting. 

Dispute Status : The "" subscriber disagrees '' status is inaccurate and misleading. This indicates a dispute that I did not initiate or resolve, which is a violation of the FCRA 's requirement for accurate information. 

Failure to Correct Information : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies and furnishers correct any inaccuracies in a timely manner. The failure to accurately report the account as authorized user status rather than primary account holder is a violation of this obligation. 

Due to these violations, I am requesting that this entire account be removed from my credit report. The incorrect reporting of this account has caused significant harm to my credit and financial standing. 

Potential Legal Action : Should this matter not be resolved in a timely manner, I will consider pursuing legal action for damages under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as I have suffered harm due to inaccurate reporting. Under the FCRA, I am entitled to seek compensatory damages, including actual damages, statutory damages, and punitive damages for the failure to accurately report my credit information. 

I will also explore the option of engaging an attorney who specializes in consumer protection law and credit reporting disputes. A law firm such as The Law Offices of XXXX XXXX XXXX, which specializes in credit report disputes, FCRA violations, and consumer protection, can assist with this matter and pursue appropriate legal remedies if necessary.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TX,782XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11157974

2024-12-14,Debt collection,Auto debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"On or around the XXXX or XXXX week in XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the law offices of Moody , Jones & Ingino , P.A. in an effort to try and resolve the debt I owed related to a prior loan with XXXX XXXX. Moody , Jones & Ingino , P.A. is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX. Their phone number is XXXX. 

The firm informed me our call was being recorded. I expressed my intention of taking care of this debt and asked if settlement options were available. The representative I spoke with indicated they would settle my debt for {$13000.00}. I asked if she could see if they would consider {$7500.00} instead. The representative said she would check with the attorney and call me back. 

I received a call back the next day and the tone of this representative had completely changed. She informed me that they had done a very thorough research of my case and had discovered that I sold my home in XXXX of this year. She proceeded to lecture me about how I owed this debt and that I had an obligation to pay this and should have done so from the proceeds of the sale of my home. I explained that the property I sold was done through a short sale and that I had not received ANY compensation whatsoever from the sale. I also told her the property was my homestead exempt property where I had lived for 9 years with my young daughter and that at closing, I had completed a homestead affidavit confirming this was our primary residence. I also told the representative that although I still had a head of household exemption from wage garnishment because my daughter is still a dependent, I was still hoping to resolve the debt if possible. The representative informed me I had NOT completed a homestead affidavit ( instead implying I had lied about this ) saying, We know you didnt file one because we would have challenged it in court if you had.. I was very upset by her accusation that I had lied about something very serious and didnt understand why they couldnt have confirmed this on their own and known I was being truthful. I became even more concerned when she told me, Now, we will not only NOT consider a lower amount than {$13000.00}, but the initial offer we made of {$13000.00} is now off the table since you had property proceeds you should have used to pay this debt and you did not pay it. This creditor informed me that as a result of my refusal to pay this debt from the sale of my home and as a result of me lying about having a homestead exempt property ; they would now not settle for any amount less than the original debt of {$20000.00}. This creditor refused to honor a settlement they had offered the previous day and were punishing me because I sold my home ( a homestead exempt property ) and didnt pay them from that sale. The representative continued to threaten me by saying, We will be proceeding with domesticating your final judgment to Georgia and will pursue repayment of this debt there since we know now that you have property there. I do NOT own property in Georgia or anywhere ( again something they know via the public records search she said they did ) and I was very upset that they were now also threatening me with legal action and accusing me of having property they know I dont have. I dont own any real estate since my home was sold in the short sale in XXXX. 

I had an attorney send them a formal letter around XX/XX/XXXX again offering a settlement amount and asking for a copy of the phone recording where these comments and threats were made, but they have refused to provide this recording or honor the previous settlement amount of {$13000.00} they had offered on the prior call. The attorney who wrote this letter was only retained for the purpose of writing that letter. I have not retained an attorney for the abusive and threatening debt collection practices. This creditor is punishing me by clawing back a previous settlement offered. The creditor continues to refuse to provide the phone recording because they know it will prove they violated debt collection practices. The creditor admitted they will no longer offer this settlement because I sold a homestead exempt property. The creditor accused me of lying about having an homestead exempt property and accused me of lying about filing a homestead affidavit. This creditor threatened me with legal action to seize property in Georgia they know I do not have. Please let me know what options I have for holding this creditor accountable for their abusive and threatening practices. 

I am not denying I owe a debt. I was trying to do the right thing by reaching out to this creditor to try and resolve the debt and simply want this creditor to be held accountable for adhering to debt collection practices they well know they are obligated to follow.

This happened on XX/XX/year>. They called at approximately XXXX XXXX. The number they called from is XXXX which is the same phone number is the bank of my debit card. They had all my personal information and they said that they needed to assist me because there was fraud on my account. They needed to transfer my money to a new account in order to avoid my funds to be taken due to fraudulent charges. They asked me to sign in to my account and do a couple things on there that I am not familiar with. I told them I was not familiar and I didnt feel comfortable doing that they sent me notifications and they confirmed my information and their phone number so everything seem legitimate. After I got off the phone with them. I received some emails from Bank of America saying we noticed some transactions on your account. At that point I felt something was wrong and I called the bank. 2 hours after receiving the fraud call I called the bank and told them what happened. I told them I didnt authorize and had no knowledge because I was tricked and fooled into logging into my account. The bank promised to freeze my account and place the transaction on hold. They also said that they would contact the other bank to let them know it was fraud. My account had a fraudulent wire transfer for {$1500.00} placed on hold and my account was frozen. How ever the next day the transaction was allowed to go through without my consent and the funds were stolen and taken from my account. I am a single mom and I do t have much. I dont have money for food or for the holidays. I have never used a wire transfer before and I am so confused as to why the bank would allow the transaction to go through after I explained to them that it was fraud because of the representatives impersonation of the bank and the calls I got directly from their phone number.

2024-12-14,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Delays with the closing process,"I am writing to formally detail a complaint regarding JP Morgan Chase Bank and its handling of the process to release our land located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX. The delays, lack of communication, and mismanagement throughout this process have caused significant inconvenience, financial loss, and frustration. 

I contacted Chases Land Transactions department on or approximately on XX/XX/year>, when I informed Chase early XXXX that we had an initial closing date of XX/XX/year>. At that time, I was assigned a file number ( XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Land Transactions stating it would take five days to review my request. Later that same day, an eight-page packet was emailed to me by the Land Transactions department to complete and return to a contact person named XXXX XXXX XXXX 

While I was relieved to finally have a point of contact, this did not improve the communication or responsiveness. 

On XX/XX/year>, I sent XXXX an email ( XXXX ) and the Land Transactions department an email seeking clarification on some verbiage in the eight-page packet. I received no response from either entity. On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with another email to check on the status of my earlier inquiry, but again, there was no response. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed XXXX to confirm whether the eight-page packet I sent by fax had been received. I also sent the packet via certified mail with payment of appraisal and processing fees and needed the confirmation they had started the process with the originals. Despite my efforts, I did not receive a response. On XX/XX/XXXX, after receiving confirmation that the documents were delivered by certified mail from my tracking number, I emailed again to inquire about the status but still did not receive a response. Taking into account I sent two live checks with the packet for {$300.00} and {$500.00} dollars. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email after several attempts from the Land Transactions department stating that my packet had been received in the mailroom but had not yet been directed to the appropriate department for scanning. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, when I emailed to check on the status again, my email was automatically returned, indicating that my emails were being blocked by the Land Transactions department. 

I waited a few days and emailed again on XX/XX/XXXX, followed by additional emails on XX/XX/XXXX. None of these emails were acknowledged, and I received no response. 

Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voice message from XXXX XXXX in the Land Transactions department stating that she was following up on my emails and that I could call her at XXXX or email her at XXXX. When I called the number, there was no option to leave a voicemail. I emailed her instead, only to receive an automated reply stating that XXXX XXXX was out of the office and would not return until XX/XX/XXXX. Her email instructed me to contact either XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX for assistance. 

I attempted to email XXXX XXXX at XXXX, but I received another automated response stating that she would be out of the office until XX/XX/XXXX. I then emailed XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX with my concerns on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a missed call from XXXX XXXX, but when I tried to return the call to his direct number, XXXX, I was unable to speak with him as he was unavailable. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after continuing to email several times all three Land Transactions contactsXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX finally replied to one of my emails and later called my husband XXXX that afternoon. She followed up with an email summarizing the items we discussed on the phone, which were points we had already confirmed in previous emails. While I appreciated her effort, the conversation did not resolve the ongoing delays. 

It is important to note that the last attempt by any Chase representative to contact me occurred on XX/XX/year>. Since then, no one from Chase has reached out by phone or email to provide updates or follow-ups on the status of my case. 

This matter is time-sensitive, as we had a closing date for the sale of this property with a buyer back in XXXX. Due to the delays caused by Chase, the original buyer for the property withdrew their offer. While this took place, I later received another offer from a different buyer, I am unable to schedule a closing date because of the continued delay and lack of progress in the land release process. 

Chase has failed to provide : A clear update on the status of my submission. 
An appraisal date or timeline for when the appraisal will be completed. 
An estimate for when the land release process will be finalized. 
The lack of communication, transparency, and proactive engagement from Chases Land Transactions department has been unacceptable. Emails often go unanswered, and none of the direct phone numbers provided for their representativesNicole Scurfield ( XXXX ), XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) have voicemail, further exacerbating the difficulty in reaching someone and obtaining updates. 

As of today, I have no indication from Chase regarding the status of my submission, no communication about the approximate timeline, and no assurance that the process is moving forward. This has caused unnecessary stress, hindered my ability to finalize the sale of the property, and resulted in financial losses. 

I request your assistance in addressing this issue and holding JP Morgan Chase Bank accountable for their inadequate service, lack of communication, and overall mismanagement of this process.

2024-12-14,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Lien release,"I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding JP Morgan Chase Bank and its handling of the release process for land located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX. The delays, lack of communication, and mismanagement throughout this process have caused significant inconvenience, financial loss, and undue stress.

In addition to the challenges detailed below, I paid a non-refundable {$500.00} appraisal fee and a non-refundable {$300.00} processing fee, as required by Chase Bank. Despite paying these fees, there has been no meaningful progress or clear communication regarding the status of my case.

Critical Impact : Lost Buyer Due to Delays The most significant consequence of Chase Banks inaction is the loss of the original buyer for the property. We had an agreed-upon closing date of XX/XX/scrub> 2024

, but Chases failure to attend to my application in a timely manner forced us to push back the closing date twice. The buyer eventually withdrew their offer, citing the continued uncertainty and delays. While I have since received another offer from a different buyer, I am unable to proceed with the sale because Chase has still not finalized the land release process. To date, I have no timeline for when this will be completed, nor have I received any updates or clarity from Chase regarding the status of my case. Breach of Duty and Financial Harm As a financial institution, JP Morgan Chase Bank has a fiduciary duty to act with reasonable care and diligence in the performance of its contractual and administrative responsibilities. The delays and lack of transparency in processing my land release request represent a breach of this duty. The resulting financial harm includes : Direct monetary loss : The non-refundable {$500.00} appraisal fee and {$300.00} processing fee have not resulted in any progress or actionable outcomes. Loss of the original buyer : The delays caused by Chase directly led to the withdrawal of the initial buyer, resulting in lost time and potential financial implications due to market conditions. Stress and inconvenience : The prolonged delays, coupled with the lack of communication, have caused significant emotional distress and hindered my ability to resolve this matter efficiently. Summary of Events and Delays [ Retain the summary as outlined earlier, including communication attempts and blocked emails. ] Legal and Regulatory Implications The failure of Chase Bank to communicate effectively and process my request in a timely manner may be in violation of federal and state consumer protection laws, including but not limited to regulations enforced by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Under principles of good faith and fair dealing, Chase Bank is obligated to manage customer accounts and related transactions in a manner that does not create unnecessary delays, financial losses, or stress. By failing to meet these obligations, the bank has created a situation of negligence and may be liable for damages arising from these actions. Additionally, the lack of a clear timeline, coupled with blocked communications and unavailability of key representatives, suggests a failure to adhere to regulatory standards of service required of financial institutions. Request for Resolution I respectfully request your assistance in addressing this issue and holding JP Morgan Chase Bank accountable for the following : Failing to provide a clear and timely update on the status of my submission. Not completing the appraisal or providing a timeline for its completion, despite accepting non-refundable fees for the service. Causing the loss of the original buyer for my property due to delays in processing my application. Failing to provide transparency, effective communication, and accountability throughout this process. I further request an evaluation of my eligibility for reimbursement of the non-refundable fees, given that the services promised in exchange for these payments have not been delivered. The delays and mismanagement by JP Morgan Chase Bank have caused significant financial harm, the loss of an original buyer, and undue emotional distress. I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take immediate action to address this matter and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,78223,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11155050

2024-12-14,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Subject : Complaint Against [ Financial Institutions Name ] Regarding Unlawful Account Block Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against Citibank N.A for their mishandling of my account, repeated refusal to verify my identity despite valid documentation, and misleading responses provided during the complaint resolution process. Below is a detailed account of the situation : Background : On Monday, XX/XX/year>, I attempted to use my ATM card to pay for car repairs, but the transaction was declined with the message account not found, despite sufficient funds in my account. Upon contacting Citibank customer service, I was informed that a block had been placed on my account due to an inability to verify my identity. I was told the issue would be resolved within XXXX hours. However, the block remained active well beyond that timeframe. 

Key Issues : Failure to Verify Identity in Person : On XX/XX/year>, I visited the branch where I had originally opened my account, bringing two forms of valid government-issued identification ( Florida ID card and Social Security card ). Despite presenting these documents and being recognized by the branch manager, the fraud department refused to lift the block, citing their inability to verify my phone number. They insisted on sending a letter with a reference code instead, delaying the resolution process unnecessarily.

Refusal to Accept Adequate Documentation : Upon receiving the reference code and contacting the fraud department, I provided the required information. Nevertheless, I was informed that I now needed to present a sealed court order verifying a name change. I explained that I am a survivor of domestic violence and that releasing this sealed document could compromise my safety. All my identification documents, including my U.S. passport, state ID, and Social Security card, reflect the name on the account, making this additional request unreasonable. 

False Claims Made to CFPB : I previously filed a complaint with the CFPB regarding this matter, under COMPLAINT ID XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Citibank ] responded to that complaint by falsely claiming that mail sent to my address had been returned and that I needed to visit a branch with proof of name change and address verification. This is untrue, as I successfully received their letter with the reference code and promptly contacted them. I am attaching said letter in the next steps. Despite this, they continued to demand the sealed court order without providing clear, written instructions on their requirements.

Violation of Consumer Rights : Citibank has displayed a lack of transparency and accountability throughout this process. They have imposed unreasonable and inconsistent barriers to verifying my identity, ignored my valid concerns as a domestic violence survivor, and provided conflicting information to both me and the CFPB.

Impact : The block on my account has caused severe inconvenience and financial hardship, as I have been unable to access my funds for essential expenses. The handling of this matter has caused me significant stress and has undermined my trust in Citibank N.A.

Requested Resolution : I request the CFPBs assistance in addressing the following : Immediate Action : Ensure that Citibank N.A. provides clear, consistent instructions on how to resolve this matter and lifts the block on my account without further unreasonable demands.

Release of Funds : Require Citibank N.A. to immediately release my funds in full.

Compensation : Direct Citibank N.A. to compensate me {$1500.00} for the undue stress, inconvenience, and financial hardship caused by their mishandling of this situation.

Accountability : Investigate the misleading and false statements made by Citibank N.A. in response to my initial complaint.

Consumer Protection : Ensure that Citibank N.A. reviews and revises its identity verification policies to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, particularly for individuals in vulnerable situations like mine.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your assistance in resolving this issue.

She said I was approved and gave me the name of her friend who is a real estate agent. I already found the house I wanted to put an offer on, but needed an agent to view it. 
After seeing it, I made an offer at the price they were asking {$450.00}, that night the agent called me and said they declined ( even thou they had no other offers and I did offer asking price ), so she suggested we offer {$450.00}, I agreed only if seller paid all closing costs. 

Not being familiar with the whole house purchase process, I assumed between the lender and realtor, they would know what closing costs would total. When I later saw the figure of {$9000.00} I assumed that was the closing costs amount they figured and closing costs meant except for escrow and appraisal fee, I would not have to pay anything at closing. Again, first time home buyer here and I was not walked through any process except the short conversations we had. 

So we start the process ( both lender and realtor knowing my finances, my budget and my limits $ ) Long story short I wound up paying {$8000.00} for a very high rate with no explanation, I also had to come up with over {$4000.00} at cash to close, witch I was not expecting. My lender also went XXXX for the week leading up to closing, she did not return calls or emails to me me or the realtor. 

I reached out to the company she worked with, her supervisor had to take over and close loan. Not only was it rushed through, but at the XXXX hour I felt extreme pressure to sign even thou the terms were not as originally what was agreed upon. I had already given notice of where I was renting and was alos going through a medical issue, so postponing and starting over and loosing my escow money was not an option I could afford.

15 USC 1681 Section 602 states I have the right to privacy.

15 USC 1681 section 604 A section 2 : it also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish a account without my written instructions.

15 USC 1666B under the billing error category : A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for and purpose.

( 4 ) the creditor 's failure to accurately reflect a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor on a statement.

( 5 ) A computation error or similar accounting error made by the creditor on a statement.

It is my knowledge that the creditor failed to furnish me with a statement 21 days prior, which ought to render any ramifications of late payments regarding the linked accounts. I am in pursuit of concrete evidence from the creditor 's bank records that will support the assertion that I failed to make a payment, resulting in an erroneous designation as late-a sign of an invoicing error-therefore. 
I humbly request that the subsequent entries be promptly undated on my consumer report to reflect their current status as follow : "" Paid as Agreed ''",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,CREDIT ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION,AR,72301,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11153288
2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am writing to lodge a formal complaint and request an investigation regarding a charged-off account, Account name : GM FINANCIAL XXXX Account number : XXXX inaccurately reported by a creditor. Specifically, the creditor has unlawfully reported a charged-off account while simultaneously reflecting a balance on my credit report. This reporting practice violates my rights under federal law, including the Internal Revenue Code ( Title 26 ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Furthermore, I have not received a 1099-C from the creditor, which is required when debt is canceled, discharged, or otherwise written off.

Basis for Complaint Failure to Issue 1099-C as Required by IRC 6050P Under the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC 6050P ), a creditor is obligated to issue a Form 1099-C when a debt of {$600.00} or more is canceled or charged off. The absence of a 1099-C creates ambiguity about the legal status of the account. It is a clear indication of noncompliance with federal tax reporting requirements and calls into question the validity of the continued reporting of any balance.

Inconsistent Reporting of a Charged-Off Account By reporting the account as "" charged-off '' while still reflecting a balance, the creditor is engaging in inconsistent and inaccurate reporting. A "" charge-off '' designation signifies that the creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible and ceased collection activities. Therefore, any balance reported is misleading and violates the accuracy standards required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). 

Court Precedent : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank, the court held that once a debt is charged off, it can not simultaneously remain active for reporting purposes or accrue interest. This precedent underscores that reporting a charged-off debt with a balance constitutes a misrepresentation of the debt 's legal status and harms the consumers creditworthiness. 

Violations of Law IRC 6050P requires creditors to issue a Form 1099-C for debts deemed canceled, charged-off, or discharged. The failure to comply violates federal tax law.

FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) mandates that information furnished to credit reporting agencies must be accurate and not misleading. The continued reporting of a balance on a charged-off account is inconsistent, inaccurate, and unlawful.

Requested Actions I respectfully request that the CFPB : Investigate the creditors noncompliance with IRC 6050P, particularly the failure to issue a Form 1099-C ; Require the creditor to clarify the legal status of the charged-off account and correct any inaccurate reporting ; Direct the creditor and credit reporting agencies to remove the charged-off account and balance from my credit report ; Enforce compliance with the FCRA and federal tax laws to prevent further violations of my rights.",,"General Motors Financial Company, Inc.",FL,341XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11153432

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am writing to formally file a complaint against USAA Federal Savings Bank regarding improper credit reporting and their failure to provide adequate notice of a missed payment, resulting in significant damage to my credit score despite my documented history of responsible financial management.

Background of Banking Relationship : I have maintained an active account with USAA since XXXX, consistently demonstrating responsible financial management through perfect payment history. Until this incident, I have never had a missed payment with USAA. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I attempted to set up automatic payments for my USAA credit card account. Despite my belief that autopay was properly established, a payment was missed. Most concerning is USAA 's complete failure to notify me of this missed payment through any communication channel - no mail, email, phone calls, or mobile app notifications were received. I only discovered the delinquency when my card was declined during a transaction on XX/XX/XXXX Upon discovering this issue on XX/XX/XXXX, I made an immediate payment of {$1000.00}, covering both the overdue balance and the next month 's payment Despite my immediate corrective action and long-standing excellent payment history, USAA representatives refused to address the situation appropriately. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX separate USAA agents who declined to remove the negative credit reporting or acknowledge USAA 's failure to provide proper notification. 

This incident directly parallels USAA 's previously documented violations reported by the CFPB in XXXX, specifically : 1. Systemic failure to provide adequate customer notifications 2. Improper handling of credit reporting disputes 3. Failure to honor customer payment arrangements 4. Deceptive practices in account servicing 5. Inadequate customer service response to disputes The consequences of USAA 's actions have been severe : - Credit score drop from XXXX to XXXX - Potential risk of increased interest rates on existing credit accounts- Time and resources spent attempting to resolve this issue I respectfully request the CFPB to investigate USAA 's notification practices and compliance with consumer protection laws. I additionally request that CFPB XXXX USAA to remove the negative credit reporting given their failure to provide proper notice, review USAA 's current customer service practices regarding credit reporting disputes, and examine USAA 's autopay system setup and confirmation procedures. 

This complaint is filed under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of XXXX, which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ) in consumer financial services. USAA 's actions appear to violate multiple consumer protection regulations, including requirements for proper notice of missed payments and fair credit reporting practices. 

I am prepared to provide any documentation or information required to support this complaint. The failure of USAA to provide proper notification and their subsequent refusal to correct their error has caused significant financial and personal hardship.

I am submitting additional evidence and clarification to my initial complaint regarding USAA Federal Savings Banks resequencing of debit transactions. Their practices have manipulated my account balances, creating conditions that could lead to overdraft fees. 

Detailed Evidence of Resequencing 1. Payment Timeline on XX/XX/XXXX : Initial Balance : {$1700.00} ( paycheck deposit of {$1400.00} ). 
Transactions Chronologically Made on XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
XXXX. XXXX Transaction from XX/XX/XXXX : This {$33.00} transaction was pending and repeatedly deducted at various points, artificially reducing my balance multiple times during the day. For example : After the XXXX payment, the XXXX transaction appeared to lower my balance to {$1600.00}. 
After the XXXX XXXX payment, the same {$33.00} was deducted again, lowering my balance to {$1300.00}. 
This pattern continued multiple times, further confusing my balances. 
3. Resequencing on XX/XX/XXXX : The next day, transactions were rearranged, placing larger amounts like the {$650.00} XXXX purchase at the top. This artificially reduced my balance to {$240.00}, followed by XXXX at {$110.00}, XXXX XXXX at {$94.00}, and so on. 
This resequencing disproportionately lowered my balances, creating opportunities for overdraft fees. 

Violation of Consumer Protection Laws USAAs resequencing practices appear to violate : 1. Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) : Protects consumers from deceptive practices related to electronic transactions. 
2. Dodd-Frank Act : Prohibits unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices. 
3. Truth in Savings Act ( TISA ) : Requires accurate disclosure of how transactions affect account balances.

I believe these discrepancies may be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The inaccuracies specifically involve incorrect reporting of account balances and the failure to provide required tax documentation for a written-off debt. The discrepancies are as follows : Incorrect Account Balance : TD BANK USA/TARGET CREDIT has reported an incorrect balance on my account, which does not accurately reflect the amount owed or the actual status of the account. Failure to Provide Form 1099-C for Written-Off Debt : Despite the fact that the debt associated with the account was written off by TD BANK USA/TARGET CREDIT , I have not received the required 1099-C form for tax reporting purposes, as mandated by the IRS. I have made several attempts to resolve these issues directly with TD BANK USA/TARGET CREDIT. I have contacted their customer service team multiple times and submitted written disputes requesting the correction of the account balance and the issuance of the appropriate 1099-C form. Unfortunately, despite these efforts, the inaccuracies have not been rectified, and the incorrect information continues to negatively affect my credit report and financial standing. As this situation has caused significant harm to my creditworthiness, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that XXXX XXXX complies with its obligations under the FCRA, including the accurate reporting of information to credit reporting agencies and the timely issuance of the 1099-C form for written-off debt.

I only used it to purchase a phone for my son XXXX  years ago and after paying his phone off, I had a {$0.00} balance on that card. I kept the credit limit of almost {$3000.00} open. I had the card stored in my Apple XXXX  and locked the card from any usage from my phone or devices in my house. Then this past XXXX, I get a message from Applecard saying I now had a balance of almost {$3000.00} where the card was maxed out down to the very last penny of my credit limit. I was shocked and quite upset since I did not use that card and its extremely suspicious that the charges were down to the very last penny of my available credit limit. That looks like someone used a bot to hack my Applecard and steal my available credit limit. I immediately called Goldman Sachs and told them what happened. It was put through their dispute team and I was told by everyone I talked to that I will not be held responsible for any unauthorized charges I did not make. The dispute with them went on for months where they removed the charges but then kept putting about {$800.00} back on me when these charges were unauthorized. I closed my Applecard where I did research on this and saw that this same exact thing happened to lots of people where their virtual Applecard got hacked and someone racked up their cards, maxing them out. They also said Goldman Sachs kept putting the charges back on them. Ive had many credit cards and Ive never had any of this happen to my accounts. They notify me of all purchases but I never got any notifications from Applecard. Some of the people posting about this problem said they went through CFPB about this very same problem with Applecard fraud and your organization resolved it for them. Hopefully you will be able to resolve this for me as well. Ive been plagued with Goldman Sachs putting the disputed unauthorized charges back on me when I didnt even use that card and actually had it locked from any use in my wallet app. The representatives I spoke to about this problem kept saying not to worry, I wont be held responsible for any unauthorized charges but they keep putting {$850.00} back on me.

I believe that both Ally Financial and the dealership are responsible for multiple violations, including violations of the XXXX XXXX and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), as well as improper handling of the repossession and theft of my personal belongings. 

XXXX XXXX Violations and TILA Concerns : Within XXXX weeks of purchasing the vehicle, I notified the dealership that the vehicle was defective and identified it as a lemon. Despite this notification, I received no follow-up or resolution, leaving me feeling helpless and vulnerable. Additionally, I am concerned that the terms of the financing, particularly the high-interest rate, XXXX violate the Truth in Lending Act ( XXXX ), warranting a review of the financial practices surrounding this loan. 

Repossession of Vehicle and Theft of Belongings : My vehicle was repossessed at night, and I have serious concerns about the legality of this repossession. As the lender, it is Ally Financials responsibility to provide evidence that the repossession was legal and conducted in compliance with all relevant laws. Since the repossession occurred at night, I request that you provide clear proof showing that all legal requirements were met.

Furthermore, my personal belongings were left in the vehicle at the time of repossession. I have made multiple attempts to contact the repossession company regarding the return of my property, but I have not received any information. I demand the immediate return of all my belongings.

Request for Immediate Action : Given these issues, I am requesting the following : 1. Immediate return of all personal belongings left in the vehicle at the time of repossession.

2. A full refund of all payments made on the vehicle, including down payments, monthly payments, and any fees paid to Ally Financial, plus interest.

3. A formal investigation into the legality of the repossession, including evidence showing compliance with the law, particularly regarding the nighttime repossession.

4. A review of the vehicles defects under Lemon Law and acknowledgment of Ally Financials responsibility for the defective vehicle and potentially unfair financing terms under TILA.

Next Steps : If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will escalate my complaint to the Attorney Generals office, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and other appropriate authorities. I am also prepared to pursue legal action to hold both Ally Financial and the dealership accountable for their actions.

The phone did not even belong to me. So I decided to request all my reports. I have been documenting the date to which I ordered my reports.

I also want to report that someone has also made a clone of my phone and everything about it including the my number. And I have noticed that my computer is act funny as well and there is web pages and documents that are popping up that doesn't belong to me. So I feel as though someone is intentionally trying to make me out to be a criminal. And it's possibly the same person that has stolen all my Personal identifying documents.

I know for a fact the statement I have made is true because, I came in contact with a person that had one of the phones that keeps popping up as devices signed into my personal account. They have also been changing my personal info about me.

According to your correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX, my minimum payment was received on the due date but was later returned, resulting in my account becoming past due.

This matter concerns an erroneous payment made from my escrow account for property insurance to the wrong insurance XXXX and the continued failure to refund the associated amount of {$760.00}. Mr. Cooper has transferred the mortgage however that do not release Mr. Cooper from the financial duty and paying the access collection fo the Escrow amount. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, Mr. Cooper, as the servicer of my escrow account, made a payment in the amount of {$760.00} to "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Florida '' ( "" American Integrity '' ), a XXXX with which I do not hold an active insurance policy. Subsequently, a duplicate payment of {$760.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX, as reflected in my Escrow Statement. These payments were made in error, and I have attached supporting documentation to substantiate this claim.

Despite my repeated attempts to address this matter, including contacting your customer service team, no meaningful resolution has been provided. Specifically, there has been : 1. Lack of Refund : To date, the amount of {$760.00} remains unpaid despite cle
ar evidence that the payment was sent to an incorrect insurance carrier.

2. Lack of Communication : There has been no adequate explanation or update regarding the investigation into this matter. Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX responses have been unhelpful and failed to address the issue in a timely and transparent manner. 
XXXX. Unethical Practices : The delays in processing this refund appear deliberate and are both unethical and in violation of Florida Statutes Section 501, which prohibits deceptive and unfair trade practices. Holding funds without justification and failing to provide a timely refund violates consumer protection laws.

This situation is further substantiated by communication from my insurance agent, who confirmed in writing that the duplicate payment error originated with Mr. Cooper. This evidence, along with documentation in the escrow statement and notes on the case, clearly demonstrates your obligation to refund the amount in question.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Mr. Cooper Group Inc.,FL,33312,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11154119

I believe this charge is unjustified, as routine wear and tear is a normal part of tenancy and should not result in additional charges to tenants.

However, I have not received any such documentation from the company.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 611 ( a ) ( 6 ), I am entitled to know the method used to verify the accuracy of this collection account. Specifically, I am requesting : 1. The method used to verify the accuracy of this collection account.

2. The name and contact information of the person or entity that provided the verification.

3. Copies of any documents or records used in the reinvestigation process.

As the collection agency did not provide validation, the continued presence of this account on my credit report is both inaccurate and non-compliant with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 809 ( a ).

Please provide the requested information and update my credit report accordingly. If the information can not be verified, this collection account must be removed from my credit file as required by FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ).

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am writing to lodge a formal complaint and request an investigation regarding a charged-off account, Account Name : LVNV FUNDING LLC, Account Number : XXXX, inaccurately reported by a creditor. Specifically, the creditor has unlawfully reported a charged-off account while simultaneously reflecting a balance on my credit report. This reporting practice violates my rights under federal law, including the Internal Revenue Code ( Title 26 ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Furthermore, I have not received a 1099-C from the creditor, which is required when debt is canceled, discharged, or otherwise written off.

Basis for Complaint : Failure to Issue 1099-C as Required by IRC 6050P.

Under the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC 6050P ), a creditor is obligated to issue a Form 1099-C when a debt of {$600.00} or more is canceled or charged off. The absence of a 1099-C creates ambiguity about the legal status of the account. It is a clear indication of noncompliance with federal tax reporting requirements and calls into question the validity of the continued reporting of any balance. 

Inconsistent Reporting of a Charged-Off Account : By reporting the account as "" charged-off '' while still reflecting a balance, the creditor is engaging in inconsistent and inaccurate reporting. A "" charge-off '' designation signifies that the creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible and ceased collection activities. Therefore, any balance reported is misleading and violates the accuracy standards required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). 

Court Precedent : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the court held that once a debt is charged off, it can not simultaneously remain active for reporting purposes or accrue interest. This precedent underscores that reporting a charged-off debt with a balance constitutes a misrepresentation of the debt 's legal status and harms the consumers creditworthiness. 

Violations of Law : IRC 6050P requires creditors to issue a Form 1099-C for debts deemed canceled, charged-off, or discharged. The failure to comply violates federal tax law.

FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) mandates that information furnished to credit reporting agencies must be accurate and not misleading. The continued reporting of a balance on a charged-off account is inconsistent, inaccurate, and unlawful.

Requested Actions : I respectfully request that the CFPB : Investigate the creditors noncompliance with IRC 6050P, particularly the failure to i
ssue a Form 1099-C ; Require the creditor to clarify the legal status of the charged-off account and correct any inaccurate reporting ; Direct the creditor and credit reporting agencies to remove the charged-off account and balance from my credit report ; Enforce compliance with the FCRA and federal tax laws to prevent further violations of my rights.",,Resurgent Capital Services L.P.,FL,341XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11156491

As a long-time American Express customer with an excellent history across multiple accounts, I value the relationship Ive built with your institution. I had enrolled in autopay for this account to ensure timely payments. However, due to a technical issue, the autopay feature did not activate as intended. Compounding this issue, I was away on an extended business trip in XXXX for two months, which limited my ability to monitor the account as closely as I normally would. 

In the current challenging economic environment, where managing cash flow has become increasingly critical, this unexpected and substantial charge has created additional financial strain. As reported by recent data, many individuals and businesses are grappling with tightening budgets and rising costs. A gesture of goodwill by waiving these charges would not only demonstrate American Expresss commitment to long-standing cardmembers but also align with your reputation for customer-first service during times of need. 

I trust that you will find my request reasonable given my history with American Express and the genuine circumstances surrounding this incident. I am confident that a resolution in this matter will further strengthen my loyalty and appreciation for your organization.

I paid the two flags and then paid the two tickets to release my registration. Car has been sitting in garage since XX/XX/XXXX due to registration. I called MCOA after waiting for a reasonable time for the flags and tickets to be cleared, but they said that they would not release the flags/tickets from MVA record until other unreported tickets were paid ( as far back as XXXX ). 

I explained to them that as far as MVA records show, if I pay the flags ( which I did ) and those two listed tickets, they would let me renew my registration. The agent was very unprofessional and insisted that MVA did not know of the other outstanding tickets. I asked then, why weren't they addressed or flagged against my previous registrations period and she said that I had to pay them. It didn't seem fair to pay something that I don't recall. I asked her to send me proof of the tickets and she said that I should have ticket notices of the outstanding violations. I told her that I don't recall those tickets and need proof. She said she would send me proof, but instead sent me a list of all tickets she mentioned on the phone without pictures or proof. just a list. I called back and said that i couldn't see or pay them due to a pin number and citation number.

She said that I can pay through her ( each ticket was {$40.00}, but their fee was {$140.00} for each {$40.00} ticket ). Also, on the list were the two tickets that I already paid ( XXXX and XXXX ). Same flag numbers that were paid in XX/XX/XXXX which appeared again recently in XXXX. 

I called XXXX XXXX Police Department and they said that they didn't have record of payment ( as MCOA only accounted for one after I provided receipt, but yet that paid ticket is on my record again and duplicate flagged ). I am not paying twice for same flags.

I think this is retaliation from me requesting MCOA to stop calling me incessantly. They obtained my number after my initial contact and started harassing me with calls. I was planning on paying the tickets, but now feel taking advantage of with this duplicate ticketing/flagging and also, purging old tickets from 6-7 years ago to add to a current collection. 

XXXX couldn't send me copies of original citations and gave me a site to go on. When i went on the site, I needed a citation number and a pin to see the actual ticket which XXXX said they didn't have or MCOA didn't have. 

The fact that they are re-flagging me is what I'm complaining about. 

Also, I saw a glimpse of vehicles that I owned which were not mine on my MVA record ( I don't remember how to get back to that site ). It said that I owned a XXXX XXXX, a XXXX XXXX XXXX with different VIN # ( never had I owned that year. Mine is XXXX ), and a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( which I remember my mom owned when she was alive, and her name is XXXX XXXX and mine is XXXX XXXX ).

Please advise what to do. I am contemplating reaching out to a lawyer, but saw this site.

XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect on disputed debts using unlawful collection letters and misrepresentation. The CFPB stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect debt that was NOT substantiated after consumers disputed the validity of the debt conducted an investigation and found that XXXX sent collection letters to consumers who DISPUTED the validity or accuracy of their purported debts, even though XXXX had NOT obtained substantiation for the debts. As a debt collection, the CFPB states you are required to have a reasonable basis for assertion that a consumer owes the purported debt if a dispute is submitted. As a result, the CFPB required XXXX XXXX XXXX to pay redress to affected consumer and pay a {$1.00} XXXX penalty to the CFPBs victim relief fund. 
The CFPB outlined a list of requests we, as consumer, can ask for when we are seeking proper validation of debt to ensure you are ethically seeking debt legally.

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Discover Financial Services [ Discover Address Subject : Request for Investigation and Removal of Inaccurate Credit Reporting Due to Identity Theft Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing regarding an account associated with my name and Social Security number that is inaccurately being reported on my credit report. I have disputed this account with you previously, but you responded by stating that the account information is accurate and belongs to me. I am informing you again that I am a victim of identity theft, and someone unlawfully used my personal information to open this account. Furthermore, they redirected all correspondence to an address that is not mine.

I have attached a copy of the identity theft report for your reference. As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, once a consumer notifies a creditor or reporting agency of identity theft and provides documentation, the account must be blocked or removed from credit reporting within four ( 4 ) business days. Despite this legal requirement, the account continues to be inaccurately reported on my credit report. 

Here are the critical points regarding this matter : Fraudulent Account : The address linked to the account is not mine, nor is it listed on my credit report. I have never received, used, or activated a Discover card.

Charged-Off and Written-Off Account : According to my credit report, the account has been charged off and written off. If the debt was indeed written off and Discover claimed a tax deduction for the amount, you would be required by the IRS to provide me with a Form 1099-C. Failure to do so implies that the reporting of a balance owed is inconsistent and a violation of FCRA standards for accurate reporting.

Violation of FCRA : Reporting inaccurate information on my credit report constitutes a violation of the FCRA. This continued reporting of an account I neither opened nor used, combined with the lack of a Form 1099-C, infringes on my rights and could expose Discover to legal liabilities, including damages. 

Unfair Tax Implications : If the debt were written off and considered taxable income, it would be unjust for me to pay taxes on income related to a fraudulent account I did not open or use. 

Under the FCRA, I am requesting the following : That Discover permanently remove and delete this fraudulent account from my credit report. 

That you cease all reporting of this account to any credit reporting agency. 

Written confirmation that you have taken these steps to rectify the issue. 

I trust that Discover will act in good faith to comply with federal laws and correct this error. If no action is taken, I will have no choice but to seek legal recourse to protect my rights and hold Discover accountable for any violations of the FCRA.",,"CAPITAL ONE, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION - GREENWOOD DELAWARE BRANCH",FL,32811,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11159480
2024-12-14,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I was scammed by a company offering me a job. The company is XXXX located in XXXX XXXX, NV. The HR woman I was emailing is XXXX XXXX. I was unknowingly the victim of fraud. I received 2 checks and deposited the checks into my credit union account. The first check received and deposited was on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$4900.00}. The second check received and deposited was on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$4900.00}. A total of {$9900.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was starting to realize I had been scammed and started trying to get help from my credit union ( Mountain America Credit Union ). On XX/XX/XXXX I met with a credit union representative. He put a hold on my account and ordered an investigative team to look into the fraudulent activity. I contacted XXXX to alert them to scam that was taking part under the company name. I contacted XXXX XXXX, and the CFO of the company. I received no response. I sent a contact general submission to the company on their website. I received a reply from XXXX XXXX ( sales or customer relations ). She simply relayed that I was scammed. I was unpleasantly surprised and disappointed seeing that XXXX is in the business to help their clients fight identify theft and online security fraud. 

When I called the credit union 's customer care team, I was told that they would credit the amounts to my account while they looked into the matter. I was told that they had 3 months to make a decision. I was told that because I knowingly deposited the fake checks, I was most likely not going to be offered any help, because they do not consider the situation fraud. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I filed and submitted complaint with the FBI. 

I called the credit union customer care several times, at least 6 times from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to find out the status of the investigation. Each time I called, I talked with a different customer service rep who was not part of the investigative team. I had to repeat my story each time and was was put on a very long hold while the customer service rep reached out to the investigative team. When the rep returned to the line they had no pertinent update information except to tell me they were working on it and provided no updates during ongoing cases. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received emails from the credit union informing me that the money that was initially credited to my account for the fake checks were being reversed. 

The reason being because I knowingly and freely deposited the checks into my account, I was at fault and the money was not going to be returned. As with all checks I receive I deposit them into my account, as does any objective person who receives a check. 

The credit union 's investigative team did not conduct a thorough in-depth investigation because they never contacted me for information or details or any other information I would expect to be part of an investigation. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I reported the fraud to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Department, XXXX # XXXX. I also called the FBI on XX/XX/XXXX for any updates on my case/report I filed. I was told it is pending and agents are still looking into it. I do not have a case number. 

I am requesting help from Consumer Protection because I am looking for help into the credit union 's handling of the situation and refunding the total of the fake checks {$9900.00}. 

I was told that the Consumer Protection acts to protect credit union members in the same way that the FDIC protects customers of banks. 

When I contacted National Credit Union Association, I was referred to CFPB.

2024-12-14,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am writing to formally complain about the persistent errors, delays, and poor customer service I have experienced since my loans were transferred to MOHELA. Despite numerous attempts to resolve my issues, including long call wait times, inconsistent information from representatives, and system errors that have not been corrected, I have not received adequate resolution. This has led to repeated delinquency notices, failed auto-pay enrollments, and confusion about the status of my loans and forbearance. Below is a detailed timeline of my experience with MOHELA. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX transfer to MOHELA was completed Signed up for auto pay XX/XX/XXXX Received a letter that my loans were in forbearance. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min phone call ) Called MOHELA to question and was told that the loans are not actually in forbearance, but the letter was to inform me that they had previously been in forbearance years prior. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min ) Received a letter that my loans were delinquent. Called to question since I had signed up for auto pay and was told that my auto pay enrollment XXXX not have been activated in time but it also looked like my loans should be in forbearance. The call escalated and a customer expert did clarify that my loans were in forbearance and they would work to update their information. This did require them to override their system and in doing that, they were going to need to cancel my auto pay. I was informed that the forbearance would end on XX/XX/XXXX and my next payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. The customer service associate I spoke with informed me that I should be sure to enroll in auto pay prior to XX/XX/XXXX to ensure that I do not receive another delinquency notice. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX hr XXXX and XXXX min call ) Attempted to enroll in auto pay as instructed in the call on XX/XX/XXXX. My MOHELA dashboard still stated that my loans were past due and because of that I would not be able to enroll in auto pay. I called MOHELA ( the automated phone system stated that I am delinquent ) to try to get more information about what was happening and what I should do. The customer service representative was not able to answer my questions stating that from all the documentation on their end, I was not delinquent. My call was sent to a supervisor who stated that the reason all of this happened is because of the XXXX plan I am on. When I stated that I did not believe I was on the XXXX plan, she looked at my profile more closely and agreed that I am not on the XXXX plan. She stated that the federal government extended the forbearance period for student loan borrowers recently for a few weeks, maybe until mid XXXX, but she couldnt be sure when it would end. She then placed me on hold to investigate more. Our call was disconnected and I did not receive a call from her, so after waiting for XXXX minutes, I called again and asked to speak with a supervisor. This new supervisor informed me that signing up for auto pay prior to XX/XX/XXXX would likely not allow auto pay enough time to finalize in time for the payment to actually process on XX/XX/XXXX. She also informed me that from her end of the system, I am showing that I am not delinquent and am in forbearance, but when she impersonates me, she sees the same information I am seeing. She stated that I should not make any payments until I am not in forbearance, but she was not able to tell me when my forbearance would end. She did state that she would escalate my ticket in an attempt to resolve the issue more quickly and that she would also personally check on the ticket but that I should not pay until this gets sorted. Due to all of the misinformation I have received, I requested that she document that I would like a supervisor to review the phone calls from the XXXX and XXXX for the purpose of quality assurance and professional development. She did state that she would pass that request on. 

Also spoke with student aid to request I move to an income driven repayment plan in an attempt to seek XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They stated I needed to submit paperwork to MOHELA. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min ) Attempted to submit my request for XXXX to MOHELAs online portal and received an error message multiple attempts in a row. 

I then called MOHELA to question why I was receiving this message and was told that because of the federal governments pause on XXXX plans, they are not taking these requests via the online submission platform and that I would need to mail or fax the paperwork if I wanted it submitted. The message to try again seems odd given that they are not taking these documents electronically. 

XX/XX/XXXX My MOHELA dashboard still states that I am delinquent and that I have another payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. 



XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX hour XXXX min call ) Called again to attempt to get this all figured out and ensure that I would not be receiving another letter that I am delinquent on another month of payments and also to ensure this would not be negatively impacting my credit score. 

On my dashboard I noticed that XXXX of my loans is showing in forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX while the other XXXX loans are showing forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX Representative advised that when things get transferred over, some things may not get transferred over from the previous system to the new system that MOHELA is using. I asked if it is correct that they have XXXX different end dates and the representative stated that she can submit a request to have the forbearance on all of the accounts end at the same time. 

The online MOHELA portal is still showing that I am past due on the XXXX loans. The representative stated that because of the high call volume these tickets are taking longer than expected. I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that it would take XXXX business days. Today is day XXXX and it is not fixed yet but was told that it could take another XXXX  days. When I asked what the ticket was actually submitted for ( past due notice or forbearance end date ) the answer was unclear stating it was a forbearance request escalation. 

Call student aid to request that transfer from MOHELA back to XXXX. 

I stated that if none of these issues can be fixed today, I will be filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Was transferred to a supervisor. 

Supervisor can adjust the end date of the forbearance to match the others on XX/XX/XXXX. Once the forbearance is adjusted, may take XXXX hours to update the past due on my account portal. 
XX/XX/XXXX Notified that my plan is past due/delinquent but I have enrolled in autopay a number of times since XXXX and it seems to not be sticking. Called but they were closed XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX hr XXXX min call ) Called MOHELA to question the delinquent notice. Waited for XXXX hour and XXXX min for my call to be answered. The rep stated that I appear not to be enrolled in auto pay. I informed him that I have XXXX emails from MOHELA on different dates stating that I have enrolled in auto pay ( see below ). He put me on a brief hold to look into this and returned telling me that it looks like all my payments are going to XXXX account. I do not believe that to be true based on the previous payments I have made manually not showing that. When I questioned him on this, he stated he could transfer me to a specialist. The estimated wait time on the call was XXXX min ( at XXXX XXXX ). I clicked the button to request a call back when my turn is up which should have been about XXXX, but as of XXXX XXXX, I still have not received this return call. 






XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX minute outgoing call XXXX minute incoming call ) I called MOHELA at XXXX XXXX  because I never received a call the day prior as I requested on their call que because I could not wait XXXX minutes. The original hold time to have my call answered was XXXX minutes. The representative who answered my call said I would need to speak to a XXXX to have my issue resolved. She transferred me and the wait time was estimated to be XXXX minutes. I elected again to have my call returned in the order it was received. At XXXX I received their call back from an agent named XXXX ID # XXXX. I was informed that their records do not show that I am in auto pay. She stated that XXXX of my XXXX loans are past due and that maybe only loan XXXX was in auto pay. When I questioned if loan XXXX was actually in auto pay, she stated she was not sure. I asked why I would not be in auto pay when I have emails from them from XXXX and XXXX stating I have requested auto pay and it would take XXXX business days to process. She informed me that it actually takes XXXX billing cycles which is not stated anywhere. I asked why the emails say it takes XXXX business days if it actually takes XXXX billing cycles. She told me she didnt know why my emails would state that. I requested to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold and XXXX returned to the call stating that she verified what she is telling me is accurate with her supervisor. I asked XXXX more times to speak with the supervisor and was told that the supervisor has not accepting this transfer. I then stated that I would have to file a formal complaint then because I was not getting the service I need and asked if the representative had anything she wanted me to put in my complaint. She stated, Sir, you can put whatever you want in that complaint. A moment later she told me she would be transferring me to a supervisor. I was transferred to a resolution XXXX named Precious ID # XXXX who investigated my concerns and informed me that I should be enrolled in auto pay which should have taken effect for the XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX billing dates. She requested a manual repair and told me I would need to call in again in XXXX business days to confirm that this issue has been resolved.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,WI,54304,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11154748

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Discover Financial Services [ Discover Address Subject : Request for Investigation and Removal of Inaccurate Credit Reporting Due to Identity Theft Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing regarding an account associated with my name and Social Security number that is inaccurately being reported on my credit report. I have disputed this account with you previously, but you responded by stating that the account information is accurate and belongs to me. I am informing you again that I am a victim of identity theft, and someone unlawfully used my personal information to open this account. Furthermore, they redirected all correspondence to an address that is not mine.

I have attached a copy of the identity theft report for your reference. As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, once a consumer notifies a creditor or reporting agency of identity theft and provides documentation, the account must be blocked or removed from credit reporting within four ( 4 ) business days. Despite this legal requirement, the account continues to be inaccurately reported on my credit report.

Here are the critical points regarding this matter : Fraudulent Account : The address linked to the account is not mine, nor is it listed on my credit report. I have never received, used, or activated a Discover card.

Charged-Off and Written-Off Account : According to my credit report, the account has been charged off and written off. If the debt was indeed written off and Discover claimed a tax deduction for the amount, you would be required by the IRS to provide me with a Form 1099-C. Failure to do so implies that the reporting of a balance owed is inconsistent and a violation of FCRA standards for accurate reporting.

Violation of FCRA : Reporting inaccurate information on my credit report constitutes a violation of the FCRA. This continued reporting of an account I neither opened nor used, combined with the lack of a Form 1099-C, infringes on my rights and could expose Discover to legal liabilities, including damages.

Unfair Tax Implications : If the debt were written off and considered taxable income, it would be unjust for me to pay taxes on income related to a fraudulent account I did not open or use.

Under the FCRA, I am requesting the following : That Discover permanently remove and delete this fraudulent account from my credit report.

That you cease all reporting of this account to any credit reporting agency.

Written confirmation that you have taken these steps to rectify the issue.

I trust that Discover will act in good faith to comply with federal laws and correct this error. If no action is taken, I will have no choice but to seek legal recourse to protect my rights and hold Discover accountable for any violations of the FCRA.",,"CAPITAL ONE, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION - GREENWOOD DELAWARE BRANCH",FL,32811,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11154638
2024-12-14,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","I received a certified letter from XXXX XXXX stating that my taxes were delinquent and that they had been purchased. At first, I was calm, I figured it had to be a mistake as we are in escrow. I called the mortgage company, who assured me that it had to be a mistake because they can clearly see- theyve been paying XXXX XXXX taxes and even advised me to look at the depletions from my escrow account. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to try to get to the bottom of this. They assured me that it was not a mistake and that my taxes were delinquent. We ended up discovering that the parcel numbers were different. They attempted to pay parcel number XXXX ( empty lot ) and the check was voided each year without them noticing. 

The mortgage company was very apologetic and put me on a personal call with XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, where he explained to me that the XXXX party that they used messed up and that they would make them pay for it. I asked him at that time what was going to happen since the amount that they had been charging me for my taxes for the last 3 years was {$1100.00} and my actual taxes are {$4600.00} ( my taxes are also too high because a home occupancy exception was never filled out ) - who pays the difference. At that time he told me that they would make the XXXX XXXX pay for it and that if somehow it does end up being the mortgage companys fault- that they would pay for it. They would never make me pay for their mistake. He also informed me that they were calling XXXX XXXX that day and having them pay for the taxes in full via credit card. 

I thought the nightmare was over. Fast forward to the beginning of XXXX. I logged in to make my payment and saw that my mortgage payment increased from {$1100.00} to {$2600.00}. I was expecting a small increase- of $ XXXX but this is more than double. Upon researching it, I realized that they made my escrow account negative {$14000.00}. Immediately, I called and they informed me that it was the difference in what they should have charged me and what they did charge me. I informed them of what the senior VP XXXX XXXX had told me- they told me that the best they could do was to reach out to him and ask for him to give me a call. He had also given me a direct number for him. I called multiple times and he declined to return my call. I contacted my broker and he informed me that he had spoken to XXXX and that someone from the office was going to call me with the findings. 

I received a call a week later from XXXX of their underlings who informed me that they just told me to say- although it is our fault- it is your responsibility to pay the escrow back. They attempted to blame this on the title company- reviewing my closing documents confirmed that it was in fact the mortgage companys fault. My closing documents have the correct parcel number and XXXX XXXX taxes estimate. After we closed they messed up the parcel numbers. The XXXX XXXX offered me a 1 year term to pay it back and called me back a week later to offer me a 5 year term. I ended up getting diagnosed with Bells palsy so I asked to finish the negotiations on XX/XX/XXXX. That day, I agreed to have them move over the extra principal payments weve made to the escrow account as well as the 5 year term to pay back the escrow account. Both of which were their suggestions. They told me they would finalize it and call me back on the XXXX. I have not received word from them so today XX/XX/XXXX I called to find out that on Monday they denied both requests. They could not tell me why the request were denied. They could not tell me why they would offer me an option that they were not authorized to offer me. They informed me that the escrow would remain at the increase of {$1500.00} and that if I failed to pay it by the XXXX, I would be fined a late fee. 

I have contacted multiple other finance companies and have been informed that because of the current inclined interest rates that I should not refinance to attempt to get away from the negligence and incompetence of XXXX.

Account Information : Creditor Name : [ Name of Medical Provider ] Account Number : [ Account Number ] Date of Service : [ Date of Service ] Amount : $ [ Amount ] I believe that this collection account should be removed from my credit report for the following reasons : 1.

2. Inaccurate Reporting : The reported debt amount is inaccurate.

This discrepancy calls into question the accuracy of the debt as reported by your agency.

3. Statute of Limitations : Please note that the statute of limitations for the collection of this debt may have expired. I request that you provide documentation establishing the date of the last activity on this account to determine whether it falls outside the statute of limitations for collections.

4.

2024-12-14,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Changes in loan terms during or after closing,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally address and document my ongoing issues with Selene Finance regarding the mismanagement of my mortgage loan. Over the course of my interactions with Selene Finance, I have encountered numerous discrepancies and conflicting information that have caused confusion, financial harm, and undue stress for me and my family. 

Key Issues Allegations of Missed Payments and Foreclosure Threats Selene Finance has stated that I was 15 months late on payments, which they claim warrants foreclosure. 
I was informed verbally that this information originated from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
When I contacted XXXX  XXXX XXXX, I was told verbally that I had never missed a payment. This conflicting information has left me confused and uncertain about the validity of Selene Finance 's claims. 
Unexplained Payment Allowance and Loss Mitigation Selene Finance is currently allowing me to make payments of {$1.00} per month, but when I asked for clarification, I did not receive a response.

I was also told verbally that I was under Loss Mitigation with Selene Finance, yet I have no recollection of signing any agreement for this service. 
Furthermore, I was informed that this alleged agreement was signed in XXXX. This is impossible, as I was stationed overseas in XXXX during that time, actively engaged in military operations in the XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Forbearance and Deferment Issues My mortgage was originally serviced by XXXX  XXXX XXXX, with whom I am still disputing their decision to place my loan into forbearance/deferment during the XXXX pandemic. This was done under coercion, with the threat of foreclosure if I did not comply. 
The only document I recall signing with a clear understanding was with XXXX  XXXX XXXX for a refinance/loan modification. 
Despite my requests to remove the deferment and establish a regular payment plan, Selene Finance continues to impose terms I did not agree to or understand. 
Account Alterations Without Consent Selene Finance has made unexplained alterations to my account, including changes to my loan that they have yet to justify clearly. 
Recently, I was informed that my account was altered due to hurricanes in Florida, yet my disputes predate these events, going back to XX/XX/XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I paid {$50000.00} to bring my account to a {$0.00} balance, except for the deferred balance of {$70000.00}. I was instructed to send this deferred balance via money order to a Texas address, but I have not received confirmation that it was received. 
Communication Barriers Selene Finance has acknowledged that they will not send me email correspondence, yet as a military service member, relying solely on postal mail is impractical and inefficient. 
Despite numerous attempts to communicate and clarify my account status, Selene Finance continues to provide vague or contradictory explanations, further complicating the situation. 
Unauthorized Forgery and Document Alteration Selene Finance has altered my monthly statements and provided documents that include forged signatures purporting to be mine. I have not signed any such agreements knowingly or willingly. 
Foreclosure Threats Without Resolution Options I have been given direct orders from Selene Finance that my home will be subject to foreclosure due to nonpayment. However, I have consistently requested that they remove the deferment on my account so that I can make payments. 
Requested Resolutions Clarification of Account Status : Provide a detailed, written explanation of the 15 months of alleged missed payments, including documentation supporting XXXX Finances claims. 
Acknowledgment of Payment : Confirm receipt and application of the {$70000.00} money order sent in XX/XX/XXXX to address the deferred balance. 
Removal of Deferment/Forbearance : Remove any imposed deferment or forbearance to allow for a regular payment structure, as I have requested repeatedly. 
Correction of Account Alterations : Restore my mortgage account to its original terms prior to the unexplained alterations made by Selene Finance. 
Cessation of Foreclosure Actions : Halt all foreclosure-related proceedings until the issues outlined above are resolved in full. 
Transparent Communication : Resume email correspondence and provide clear, written responses to all inquiries to ensure transparency moving forward. 
Investigation of Forged Documents : Investigate and address the unauthorized use of my signature on documents I did not sign or agree to. 
Closing XXXX XXXX Finances actions, including the refusal to provide clear explanations, alteration of my account without consent, and reliance on vague or contradictory policies, have placed my home and financial stability in jeopardy. The lack of transparency and accountability is unacceptable. 

I respectfully request an immediate review of this matter and prompt action to address the issues outlined. I am committed to resolving this dispute but need Selene Finance to act in good faith and with integrity.",,Selene Holdings LLC,FL,34759,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11156574

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To Whom It XXXX Concern, I am filing a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate reporting of an account on my credit report, which I am requesting be removed entirely. The account in question is a XXXX  account, where I was listed as an authorized user. Below are the account details : Account Name : XXXX  Account Number : [ If available, you can include the last XXXX digits of the account number here ] Reported Balance : {$5200.00} Last Reported Date : XX/XX/XXXX Credit Limit : {$2100.00} Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Account Closed : XX/XX/XXXX The issue at hand is that this account was reported as closed with a balance of {$5200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, despite my role as an authorized user and not the primary account holder. Furthermore, the dispute resolved status showing "" subscriber disagrees '' is entirely inaccurate. As an authorized user, I do not hold responsibility for the balance, and the statement is misleading. 

I request the immediate removal of this account from my credit report. The account has been inaccurately reported, and its inclusion is harmful to my XXXX XXXX and financial well-being. 

Legal Basis for Request : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section XXXX ( a ), furnishers of credit information are required to provide accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies. The current reporting of this account violates the FCRA in the following ways : Inaccurate Reporting : The account was reported as a closed account with an outstanding balance. As an authorized user, I have no legal responsibility for the balance, and this should be reflected in the reporting. 

Dispute Status : The "" subscriber disagrees '' status is inaccurate and misleading. This indicates a dispute that I did not initiate or resolve, which is a violation of the FCRA 's requirement for accurate information. 

Failure to Correct Information : The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies and furnishers correct any inaccuracies in a timely manner. The failure to accurately report the account as authorized user status rather than primary account holder is a violation of this obligation. 

Due to these violations, I am requesting that this entire account be removed from my credit report. The incorrect reporting of this account has caused significant harm to my credit and financial standing. 

Potential Legal Action : Should this matter not be resolved in a timely manner, I will consider pursuing legal action for damages under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as I have suffered harm due to inaccurate reporting. Under the FCRA, I am entitled to seek compensatory damages, including actual damages, statutory damages, and punitive damages for the failure to accurately report my credit information. 

I will also explore the option of engaging an attorney who specializes in consumer protection law and credit reporting disputes. A law firm such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, which specializes in credit report disputes, FCRA violations, and consumer protection, can assist with this matter and pursue appropriate legal remedies if necessary.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,782XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11159034

2024-12-14,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX I closed a joint account that had a value of {$31000.00} I had with my deceased father. He had been dead for years and my mother submitted his death certificate to Wells Fargo several times to close his other accounts. I requested the closure of the account and sent them another copy of the death certificate. Wells Fargo closed the account and sent me a check that required his signature. I called and asked for a reissued check. They said they would send it. 
A few weeks go by and I call again for an update and they told me they needed more time to reissue the check. I waited a couple more weeks and called again to ask for an update and they told me they can not reissue checks and there was never a request to reissue checks. I asked why they issued a check that could not be cashed and they insisted there was no problem. I asked them to reissue a check anyway and they said I would need to fill out a lost/stolen check form. 
I received the form and returned it. It was rejected. They sent a new copy and informed me that the form needed to be notarized. This time, the form had my father 's name in the name section mixed in with my name. It appeared to be a typo. I asked them to send me a new form. They insisted it was not a typo and that it would not be rejected by a notary. I brought it to a notary and they refused to sign it ( it was not my name in the form ). I called and asked for them to reissue the form as the name was wrong. I insisted they make sure my name was the only name on it and they refused to comply. Again, insisting that the notary would sign off on it. I asked them to check with their legal department that this was the case and they confirmed. 
I received the 3rd form and it now had a XXXX ' sign in the name and my father 's name on it. The notary rejected it again ( my name does not have a '+ ' in it ). I called again and asked for a form with only my name on it. They refused and said they could send a blank one instead. I asked to change to written communication. At the time they agreed but they responded only briefly via paper mail before returning to direct calls and not responding to mail. I filled out the blank form and notarized it. I noticed they had not sent me any return envelope not return address but luckily I had one of the old ones and I sent it back. 
I called a couple weeks later because I was receiving no response from written communication and no calls. They told me they had received no form. I asked them to check at the address I sent it to and they told me it would take a week to research it. I called a couple weeks later and they insisted they were still working on it. A couple weeks later I call again and they deny the request to research. They claim I never called and there was no form or request to look for the form. I asked for them to send me another form multiple times over the coming months but the forms never arrived.

Multiple times over the course of these exchanges, I asked to be escalated to management or a higher priority. These requests to speak to management were denied and when I requested escalations I had my case moved to a different department that would send me repeated canned responses. They would either call or email saying "" your case is closed. We sent you a form '' I would reply "" I have not received a form '' and they would reply "" we are reopening the case, please give us 3 weeks to investigate the case '' and then they would reply with "" your case is closed. Our records show we had sent you a form last time ''. 
Finally after passing a year of this I demanded, formally, that Wells Fargo issue me a check for the money they owe me. They refused to respond. I asked a local lawyer and they tell me there is nothing they can do because Wells Fargo engaged with me primarily via call to make sure I wouldn't have a record. I have many records of communication but not enough for a case. 
I should also mention that they had told me this matter could be "" fixed if you went to an in-person branch ''. However there is no branch in my entire state and the closest one is over 10 hour drive. It is doubtful that there would be a fix at an in person branch and I have run out of options. It seems like this bank can rob me and there is nothing I can do.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MA,021XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11154605

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Complaint About Misleading Foreclosure Reporting by M & T Mortgage Bank Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding misleading and deceptive credit reporting practices by M & T Mortgage Bank. Specifically, they have reported that a foreclosure was initiated on my mortgage account, despite the fact that I paid the mortgage in full and in accordance with the terms of the contract. 

The report from M & T Mortgage Bank stating that foreclosure started is misleading because the contract does not include any provision for reporting such an event if the account was paid as agreed and settled in full. The reporting of a foreclosure, despite the account being paid off, has created significant obstacles in my ability to secure a mortgage from other lenders. These lenders have been unwilling to approve me for a mortgage due to the false foreclosure reporting, forcing me to seek a loan directly from M & T Mortgage Bank, who is aware that the account was paid in full. 

This reporting is not only deceptive but also harmful, as it misrepresents my credit history and falsely implies that I engaged in a short sale or other foreclosure-related actions. This could impact my ability to obtain credit or loans in the future. 

I believe this misreporting is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates accurate and fair reporting by all credit reporting entities. I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter and help ensure that M & T Mortgage Bank corrects the false information on my credit reports.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,M&T BANK CORPORATION,TX,75287,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11156837

2024-12-14,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Installment loan,Problem with additional add-on products or services,,"First off this isnt my first complaint on this same subject, after reviewing the companies response I have realized I shouldve provided more info on my issues with XXXX  XXXX XXXX  and Aqua finance. I am also unhappy with the CFPB for closing my first complaint. 

Some background, I had just moved into my new home, and in process of renovating my old home for my tenants, needless to say I was exhausted. Further more, the water quality at my new home was very hard and metal heavy, giving us digestion problems so I was a little desperate at the time of the signing. I am a night worker that works XXXX hours daily so during the time of any signings I did with Aqua and XXXX  I was not in any rational condition. 
Severe mistake of mine to have let my exhaustion get the best of me, I was rushed into signing paperwork, not realizing I was paying for a severely overpriced system with a ridiculous APR. if I had been more aware I wouldve never agreed to this contract. 
Being busy with work and home renovations I had let time go by. I had forgotten the contacts details. It wasnt until I got home a few weeks later that I saw what XXXX had done. 

The certificate of completion was signed by XXXX XXXX who had missed the problem. It wasnt noticed until I had gotten home a few weeks later. I did not sign the certificate myself because I was unhappy with the results. 
I did not like the installation they did, they ran a cable from the outside of my home to the inside of my home to plug into an outlet. I complained to XXXX  about the installation, I spoke to XXXX XXXX who told me it was the way the company did it and that nothing could be done to change it. I was very unhappy. XXXX offered to have my system inspected for performance which I declined because I saw no use for it since the system was working fine but it was the installation and arrangement of the system I had a problem with. It is affecting the way I arrange my room and its very inconvenient, XXXX XXXX from XXXX said he couldnt offer anything else to help my situation. 
I understand that XXXX provided pictures to Aqua fianc and Cfpb to show the installation, but I have doubts as to what was shown. It doesnt matter if the installation was up to standard, it was not approved by XXXX the customer. And I still strongly believe that the procedure shouldve been discussed first. 

Previously I had also tried to have the system removed but I chose not to since multiple XXXX  XXXX  representatives had told me I was still to pay the loan. Last thing XXXX suggested suggested I took care of the situation with Aqua finance.

Aqua finance was also negligent of my needs. All they did was state that I signed the contract and that I was responsible for paying it off. Typical of any shady business. They ignored my actual issues and They ignored the fact that I didnt sign the certificate of completion. 
I also believe that 3 days is very little time to cancel. I am sure that if it was legal for XXXX  or Aqua finance to do so they wouldve given us NO time. They know what they are doing and they wanted to defraud me since the start. They are XXXX companies that are preying on unsuspecting and exhausted people. 
Last part. I was informed by XXXX that Company XXXX XXXX XXXX had posed as a XXXX parcel on hold notice in the mail to get him to contact them. 
Bad business practice. I mentioned this to XXXX XXXX Aqua finance who did not seem to care. 
Since the day of the contract I have been refusing to pay off the loan. I will notify the credit unions of my situation since I plan to escalate this if the CFPB doesnt help.

2024-12-14,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction problem,,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification from my bank ( XXXX ) for acct # XXXX of insufficient funds for an amount of {$77.00}, and now the amount has increased since I was not able to transfer money from another account on time to avoid an overdraft fee of {$34.00}, bringing the total amount of the insufficient funds to {$110.00}. 

My complaint is about the confusing emails and confirmations that I received from Capital One that led to the above situation. It begins with the fact of scheduling a payment to my credit card account ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX of {$100.00}. After I scheduled the payment, I received an email confirming the payment. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another email confirming that the payment had posted. 

To my surprise on the following Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX I received another email from Capital one stating that my payment of {$100.00} had been returned due to insufficient funds. Immediately, I checked my XXXX account and I noticed that there was a {$100.00} more in the account than there should be. On the same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I tried again to schedule the payment on the Capital One platform for {$100.00}. 

Next, I received the email confirming that I had scheduled the payment on the same day. Just a little later after I receive that email, I received another email the same day saying your payment has been returned, it listed the previous date that I had tried to schedule, which was on XX/XX/XXXX, but at this point I did not know what to think and was even more confused. 

On that same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One and spoke with a customer rep who eventually transferred me to a XXXX customer rep who then acknowledged that the only payment request that they saw from capital one was in XX/XX/XXXX. I never heard from the other customer rep after talking with this XXXX customer rep. I was a bit suspicious if there was any fraud involved, which there has been much lately. 

After speaking with Capital One and XXXX, I assumed that capital one had not properly posted the payment or something had happened in transition and I had also received another email saying that the payment had been returned so I naturally assumed that I needed I transferred {$100.00} from my XXXX  account to my Capital One checking account ( XXXX ). I did the transfer from XXXX  because, at this point, I was confused and I did not trust trying to schedule a payment again on Capital Ones platform. 

The next day on XX/XX/XXXX, I received another email from Capital One stating that the payment had posted. After seeing this and checking this account that the payment had posted I immediately tried to transfer the {$100.00} from my Capital One checking account back to the XXXX  account because I did not have enough to cover {$200.00} in my XXXX  account ( {$100.00} posted + {$100.00} transferred after talking to customer reps of both banks ) nor was I able to transfer the money into the account on time to prevent an overdraft fee because it was Friday. 

Im entirely blaming this overdraft fee of {$34.00} and the insufficient funds of {$77.00} solely on Capital One for their incompetence and confusing emails. Im XXXX XXXX XXXX, but I can read and comprehend and I know that something is not right in the way that this transaction was done this time and I would like for them to pay for the overdraft fee of {$34.00} and whatever else that may occur since the account is still in overdraft mode. I would also like for CFPB to investigate their process of how they inform their customers about payments and scheduling. 

This all couldve been totally avoided if emails wouldve been clear and transactions processed correctly.

I took off work early to meet him, but he refused to come back at the scheduled time, advising I must start the scheduling process over again. He ended up having me take pictures and sent them to Pennymac, with his write up ( from an inspection he did not do ), and Pennymac determined my work was 50 % complete and would issue 50 % of the funds. My house repairs are completed 2 weeks after the scheduled inspection, and I still have not received any funds. I spoke with customer service, again, and they initiated a dispute, freezing even the 50 % payment, making me restart the inspection request over again because they reviewed the previous inspection ( which never happened ), and determined it only 60 %. When asked what the recourse is to have accountability, or to even expedite the final inspection to pay the contractor, they advised that there was none.

**Factual Background** : - Equifax has persisted in representing this account as accurate, notwithstanding my successful dispute with XXXX, which culminated in the removal of said account from my credit profile. 
- This inconsistency raises substantial concerns regarding the reliability and validity of Equifax 's verification process. 

**Legal Basis** : - Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i, consumer reporting agencies are mandated to expeditiously delete any disputed item that has been determined to be inaccurate or unverifiable.

- The conflicting results from the same financial institution signify a potential failure in Equifax compliance with the statutory obligations established under 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ), which necessitate that consumer reporting agencies uphold standards of accuracy and integrity in reporting.

**Impact on Consumer Rights** : The ongoing reporting of this inaccurate account has inflicted significant harm upon my creditworthiness and overall financial well-being. Such conduct contravenes the principles enshrined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which underscores the necessity for fairness, impartiality, and consumer privacy. 

**Demand for Remedial Action** : I hereby demand the immediate expungement of this erroneous account from my Equifax credit report. Enclosed, please find pertinent documentation from XXXX that corroborates my assertions. 

I respectfully implore the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to undertake a comprehensive investigation into the practices of Equifax in this matter.

2024-12-14,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Discover Financial Services [ Discover Address Subject : Request for Investigation and Removal of Inaccurate Credit Reporting Due to Identity Theft Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing regarding an account associated with my name and Social Security number that is inaccurately being reported on my credit report. I have disputed this account with you previously, but you responded by stating that the account information is accurate and belongs to me. I am informing you again that I am a victim of identity theft, and someone unlawfully used my personal information to open this account. Furthermore, they redirected all correspondence to an address that is not mine.

I have attached a copy of the identity theft report for your reference. As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, once a consumer notifies a creditor or reporting agency of identity theft and provides documentation, the account must be blocked or removed from credit reporting within four ( 4 ) business days. Despite this legal requirement, the account continues to be inaccurately reported on my credit report.

Here are the critical points regarding this matter : Fraudulent Account : The address linked to the account is not mine, nor is it listed on my credit report. I have never received, used, or activated a Discover card.

Charged-Off and Written-Off Account : According to my credit report, the account has been charged off and written off. If the debt was indeed written off and Discover claimed a tax deduction for the amount, you would be required by the IRS to provide me with a Form 1099-C. Failure to do so implies that the reporting of a balance owed is inconsistent and a violation of FCRA standards for accurate reporting.

Violation of FCRA : Reporting inaccurate information on my credit report constitutes a violation of the FCRA. This continued reporting of an account I neither opened nor used, combined with the lack of a Form 1099-C, infringes on my rights and could expose Discover to legal liabilities, including damages.

Unfair Tax Implications : If the debt were written off and considered taxable income, it would be unjust for me to pay taxes on income related to a fraudulent account I did not open or use.

Under the FCRA, I am requesting the following : That Discover permanently remove and delete this fraudulent account from my credit report.

That you cease all reporting of this account to any credit reporting agency.

Written confirmation that you have taken these steps to rectify the issue.

I trust that Discover will act in good faith to comply with federal laws and correct this error. If no action is taken, I will have no choice but to seek legal recourse to protect my rights and hold Discover accountable for any violations of the FCRA.",,"CAPITAL ONE, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION - GREENWOOD DELAWARE BRANCH",FL,32811,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11159481

Additionally, under Section B, it states that a person shall not furnish information to any consumer reporting agency if they have been notified by the consumer that specific information is inaccurate, and the information is indeed inaccurate. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding inaccuracies in my credit reporting. Unfortunately, the representative I spoke with was unhelpful and did not address my concerns adequately. I emphasized that credit card accounts remain on a credit report for seven years and that I have maintained this account in good standing for over a year. Despite this, XXXX XXXX XXXX has not updated my information with all three credit bureaus without correcting the inaccuracies. 

I kindly request that your offices investigate this matter and take appropriate action against XXXX XXXX XXXX for their non-compliance with the FCRA. It is essential for consumers to be protected from inaccurate reporting that can negatively impact their creditworthiness.

2024-12-14,Debt collection,I do not know,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"My credit reports show a reputed collection account XXXX with XXXX XXXX  with different opening dates, balances, first date of delinquency, balance due, and/or last date of activities. I have never had an account with this company nor any record of any type of first notice of debt including rights to dispute from this company. And if I, by chance, even though I have no recollection nor tangible record, naively spoke with a representative of this company over the phone about this debt, I was not informed by that representative that I had a right to dispute this debt nor a specific timeframe to do so.

15 USC 1692g 809. Validation of debts ( a ) Notice of debt ; contents states that within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector. Https : //www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/receipt definition of the word receipt is- a writing acknowledging the receiving of goods or money ; proof, evidence. I have never signed nor received any type of acknowledgement receipt from a mailing service for any mail from this company. I am familiar with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Had I signed a receipt of notice for the proper and legal documentation from this company, I wouldve immediately responded asking for lawful verification of debt or copy of court ordered judgement well within the lawful 30 days allotted. After receiving my response letter with receipt, this company would have to legally cease from collection attempts and remove the account from my credit reports until their proof of verification is sent back to me. This company has reported to my credit reports without observing the FDCPA laws. My credit has been impacted adversely because of this companys irresponsibility.

My credit reports also show that AMERIFINANCIAL SOLUTIONS has provided this alleged account with inaccurate information. The FCRA requires that all data reported from the credit reporting agencies, creditors, or furnishers on a consumer 's report be 100 % ACCURATE, 100 % VERIFIABLE, and 100 % TIMELY. This means no data can be reported that can't be legally PROVEN to be 100 % accurate. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. My XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX credit reports all show different open dates, balances, first date of delinquency, balance due, and/or last date of activities for this same exact account. Therefore making this alleged account full of inaccuracies.

This is erroneous and flawed reporting that is listed on my credit reports. Not only did AMERIFINANCIAL SOLUTIONS not follow lawful FDCPA communications protocol, but it has also broken FDCPA False or Misleading Representations protocol as well. A debt collector, in collecting a debt, may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation. Specifically, a debt collector may not falsely represent the character, amount, or legal status of the debt, or of any services rendered, or compensation he or she may receive for collecting the debt. A debt collector may not communicate, or threaten to communicate, false credit information or information that should be known to be false, including not identifying disputed debts as such. Each of my 3 credit reports show different information instead of them all showing the exact same information. This is considered a false and misleading representation that this company has submitted to the credit reporting agencies.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has begun to aggressively litigate companies who continuously violate consumer laws. According to consumerfinance.gov, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) took action against the nations two largest debt buyers and collectors for using deceptive tactics to collect bad debts. The Bureau found that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX bought debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacking documentation, or unenforceable. Without verifying the debt, the companies collected payments by pressuring consumers with false statements and churning out lawsuits using robo-signed court documents. The CFPB has ordered the companies to overhaul their debt collection and litigation practices and to stop reselling debts to third parties. 
The CFPB found that XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect debts that they knew, or should have known, were inaccurate or could not legally be enforced based on contractual disclaimers, past practices of debt sellers, or consumer disputes. The companies also filed lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves. These practices violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

The website also stated that XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX threatened and deceived consumers to collect on debts they should have known were inaccurate or had other problems, said CFPB Director XXXX XXXX. Now, the two biggest debt buyers in the market must refund millions and overhaul their practices. We will continue to take action to protect consumers from illegal and obnoxious debt collection practices.

Just as the CFPB took action against the above companies, I am asking the CFPB to take action against this company as well. Please help me get this account removed immediately and conduct an investigation on this company. As a consumer, Im publicly publishing this descriptive complaint on consumerfinance.gov so that others can learn from my experience and so that this government agency can use this information to help work with other violations and complaints from consumers regarding this company. It is not my duty to provide evidence that this alleged debt is not mine. It is the legal obligation of the debt collector to first prove or provide proof of evidence that they can lawfully collect on any alleged debt before a consumer challenges it, accurately report to the credit agencies, and follow all FCRA and FDCPA laws. As of today, they have been very unsuccessful to do so.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Millco Management,MS,397XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11153805

2. Failure to Provide Notice : I received no advance notice of the garnishment, which left me unable to contest or prepare for the financial impact.

3. Expired Debt : The medical debt in question is from XXXX, and is well past the statute of limitations for collection under Oregon law XXXX 
4. Improper Service : I was never properly served notice of the lawsuit tied to this garnishment. The documents were delivered to an address I no longer resided at, invalidating the service.

5. Harassment : Ray Klein, Inc. made attempts to garnish wages at a job I did not even work at, further highlighting the companys predatory and harassing behavior. They also pressured me for employment information during communications, which I felt was intimidating.

The companys actions are a clear violation of my consumer rights under federal law, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and relevant state laws. 

Impact of the Issue : The garnishment has caused severe financial hardship. I was left with no funds to cover essential bills, rent, or basic living expenses for XX/XX/2024. 
I have experienced significant emotional distress, including anxiety and embarrassment, as I had to take time off work to address this issue. 
My family has faced undue strain, particularly after Ray Klein, Inc. improperly attempted to garnish my husbands wages, even though the debt is solely in my name. 

Resolution Sought : I request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : 1. Investigate Ray Klein , Inc. for violations of the FDCPA and other consumer protection laws.

2. Require the company to reimburse the improperly garnished funds immediately.

3. Ensure Ray Klein , Inc. ceases any further collection efforts, including garnishments or wage attempts, on this expired debt.

4. Hold the company accountable for harassment and violations of consumer protections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your help in holding Ray Klein, Inc. accountable and ensuring that consumers are protected from such predatory practices.",,"Ray Klein, Inc.",OR,97224,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11154096

As a consumer, I have the right to accurate and verifiable information in my credit file, and I am requesting the immediate removal of the bankruptcy records reported by your agency. 
Disputed Item Details : Public Record Type : Bankruptcy Filing Date : XX/XX/year> Court Name : United States Bankruptcy District of Arizona Reason for Dispute : I have conducted a thorough investigation and obtained the following information : XXXX. Bankruptcy Court Statement : I sent a letter to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court inquiring about the reporting of bankruptcy records. The court confirmed that they do not report any information to credit agencies. They also stated that if someone needs bankruptcy information, they must : o Physically visit the court and pay a fee to retrieve the information, or o Register for a XXXX  account and pay a monthly fee to access records online. 
XXXX. XXXX Confirmation : I contacted XXXX, a common third-party provider for public records, and they confirmed they do not have any of my bankruptcy information in their system. I have enclosed their written confirmation for your review. 
XXXX. Equifax and Credit Report Statements : Upon reviewing my credit reports, both Equifax and XXXX stated that they use a third party to retrieve public records, specifically naming XXXX as their source. However, as mentioned above, XXXX has explicitly confirmed they did not provide any information regarding my bankruptcy, and they provided me with a confirmation letter for proof. 
Given these facts, it is clear that the bankruptcy information on my credit report can not be verified and must be removed. The continued presence of inaccurate information on my credit report violates 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires credit reporting agencies to maintain maximum possible accuracy. Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), unverifiable information must be deleted during the dispute resolution process.

Action Requested : XXXX. Investigate the accuracy of the reported bankruptcy records immediately. 
XXXX. Remove the bankruptcy records from my credit file since they can not be verified by your data provider ( XXXX ). 
XXXX. Provide written confirmation of the investigation results and the actions taken regarding this dispute. 
Enclosures : Correspondence from XXXX confirming the absence of my records in their system Highlighted copies of my credit reports showing the disputed bankruptcy records Failure to Comply : If you fail to verify the accuracy of this information or remove it promptly, I will take the following actions : XXXX.

2024-12-14,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"I am writing to formally address a matter regarding the wrongful withholding of funds and the subsequent false accusation of fraud by fifth third bank. I previously filed a claim against your institution concerning the deposit of a check that was unfairly held and not returned despite assurances to the contrary. Contrary to the representations made by your institution, my account was not closed, and the funds were not returned as promised. 

In addition to these failures, I recently received correspondence from the Department of the Treasury stating that due to my endorsement of the check, I am precluded from filing a claim with them. However, the banks actionsincluding the false allegation of fraud and the unlawful withholding of my fundsconstitute a violation of my rights under various state and federal statutes. 

Violation of the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) : Under the Uniform Commercial Code, specifically UCC 3-304, a bank is required to honor checks unless there is a valid reason for non-payment, such as a stop payment order or insufficient funds. Your refusal to process the check and return the funds is a direct violation of these provisions. 

False Accusation of Fraud : The false accusation of fraud, without substantiated evidence, may violate state consumer protection laws and could be considered defamation under state tort law. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), the bank has an obligation to conduct fair business practices, and falsely accusing a customer of fraud when no evidence supports such claims constitutes an unlawful business practice. 

Theft and Conversion of Funds : Under state law, the unauthorized retention or withholding of funds that rightfully belong to an account holder constitutes theft or conversion. I request immediate reimbursement of the funds that have been wrongfully withheld and a formal resolution of this matter. 

Despite the Treasurys position on my claim, I am entitled to recover my funds, as the bank has failed to meet its legal obligations and has caused me financial harm by withholding my deposit and making false accusations. I request that you promptly resolve this matter by either refunding my funds or providing a valid explanation and legal basis for the continued withholding. 

Please respond in writing within 3-5 business days. If this matter is not resolved satisfactorily, I will be compelled to pursue further legal remedies, including filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), my states Attorney Generals office, and exploring civil legal action for recovery of my funds.

XXXX. State Consumer Protection Laws : These actions may also violate state laws designed to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, such as misrepresentation of loan terms or amounts owed. 
XXXX. Breach of Loan Servicing Agreements : Heartland ECSIs failure to properly manage my deferment and notify me of the loan transfer may breach their contractual obligations as a federal loan servicer.

After seeing a XXXX rating average review of below XXXX stars of about XXXX reviews, I can understand why they keep changing their name. Reading those reviews, my experience has been consistent with thousands of others who mortgages have unfortunately been acquired by this company. 

In short, I have a traditional mortgage on my home that I purchased about three years ago. 

I have made every single payment on time or early in the exact monthly amount due. Just to make it extra clear, I have never paid a principle-only payment of any kind. They only options the mortgage company provides online are "" principal payment '' or "" one-time payment '', so of course I always select "" one-time payment ''. 

In XXXX of 2024, they took my monthly payment but did not apply it to the principal. Then, we get in this trap cycle each month : -then they say I am late -they add a late fee -they require an additional {$3500.00} payment of my own cash to be "" on time '' and not harm my credit -they finally reverse the transaction about 30 days later -they admit it was their fault and waive the fee ( on my recorded line ), they say the problem is fixed, that my payment has been applied as a mortgage payment, and that I do not need to pay the next month 's payment since it is already paid -they do not refund my cash to me -then, starting with the new month, they say I am behind again, as if that {$3500.00} is not applied as a payment after all -they add a late fee... rinse and repeat I finally checked with the company that originated the loan and then sold it. My original loan officer ( who is also the branch manager ) of the original company prior spent many hours reviewing each mortgage transaction line and verified that I had paid an extra payment correctly and should be ahead on payments. 

Even after a month of basic communication where she and I have emailed and communicated with the mortgage company by phone, the mortgage company still has not fixed the issue and has not replied to us.

2024-12-14,Debt collection,Rental debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"I have 2 complaints : One for the company ( XXXX ) and the collection agency. 
1. Irregular charges from Land lord : I rented a room in a house from XXXX, address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I moved in XX/XX/year>, with a monthly rent of {$390.00}, a deposit of {$200.00}, and a utility deposit of {$120.00}. I enquired about breaking a lease on XX/XX/year>. I was told I need to give a 60-day notice and pay extra one month rent of {$390.00}. It was never in their policy what the charges will be if I break a lease without 60-day notice and I was never informed during my enquiry. I made a miscalculation when I was filling the form for a 60-day notice, I chose XXXX instead of XX/XX/year>. I was informed about the discrepancy but I already bought my ticket with the XX/XX/year> plan. I paid all the charges including extra one month rent ( included in the attached documents and it was titled "" lease break fee '' ). Up till this point there was no information about any other charges, until after some weeks, I received an email of being charged {$1000.00} and my {$390.00} was deducted, so I need to pay extra {$690.00}. I initially negotiated and pleaded for a lesser amount in other to keep the house but I stopped when I found out that it was a rip-off. 
My arguments : 1. I was not aware of any extra charges till I left the house and also not included in their policy. 2. My deposit was not refunded. 3. While would a room of $ XXXX monthly require {$1000.00} for a lease break ( outrageous ). 

2. Collection agency did not communicate with me and did not give me enough time before putting it on my credit. I did not have a physical address and a phone number when I moved out of the house, the company ( XXXX ) communicates with me through email. I am curious why the collection agency did not send me an email, informing me of putting it on my credit before doing so. 
My point : I want the collection removed from my credit.

My pay day is XX/XX/XXXX and I made funds available on XX/XX/XXXX. I got an email saying they will try a couple more times to process the payment and I don't have to do anything. 

I saw that they processed the payment on XX/XX/XXXX. 
But then I also saw they charged a returned payment fee of {$29.00}. This was not mentioned in the email I received - that just said I don't have to do anything and they'd try a couple more times, which they did. 

When I contacted them a couple of times, I was told that there is an automated system that puts the thing and based on account history, the system is declining the waiver. I was told by a supervisor that I don't use the card often and that seems to be a reason why the system is not waiving the charge. The customer service people were nice but they were handicapped by a system that seems biased and making decisions based on how much the card is used. 

My complaints are ( a ) I was charged though I was told I don't have to do anything ( b ) my payment was processed the next day after it was declined ( c ) the charge is high {$29.00} compared to XXXX balance of {$37.00}. ( d ) the system output for waiver is arbitrary and unfair and discriminatory ( XXXX ) I was trying to pay off much early and it is not late payment.

This account is inaccurate and associated with identity theft. Specifically : 1. False credit disputes beginning in XX/XX/XXXX have been made in connection with this account, apparently to manipulate the alleged, unverified alleged debt back onto the associated checking account for financial gain.

2. The alleged debt is unknown as to how it occurred, and still unverified at this time of writing. 
3. On my XXXX credit report, the account contains a "" Resolved '' Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) dispute notation, despite me never filing a dispute under FCBA. 
4. On my XXXX credit report, a "" Consumer disputes after resolution '' comment has been added, even though no true resolution was reached, as the fake disputes were never adequately investigated by XXXX  XXXX XXXX despite my multiple written requests. 
5. The account is not notated as being in litigation across XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, which it currently is. 
XXXX  XXXX XXXX has not acknowledged suspicious activity related to this account that I did not initiate nor did Blitt and Gaines P.C. their attorneys. Despite this, my attempts to address these issues directly with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and their legal representatives, Blitt and Gaines P.C., have resulted in repeated delays and insufficient action. Blitt and Gaines have agreed to pause legal proceedings pending further investigation, but the negative impact on my credit continues. I have also called three times requesting the last contract on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I had under this account. This of which still has not been sent to me, and with the first two requests being past 30 days of not receiving. Also, in the first CFPB complaint I did - XXXX in XXXX the accurate reporting letter sent to me was in error as I never did this dispute on the alleged balance, nor this account directly to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX , nor have I did a dispute on the alleged balance, and account in XX/XX/XXXX to return all alleged charges to the associated checking account. Twice this year, I have requested a sworn affidavit or declaration in regards to the account both in XX/XX/XXXX via USPS, with tracking numbers to both XXXX  XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Blitt and Gaines P.C. - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and, XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Blitt and Gaines P.C. - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Both of which past 30 days to date in both requests from both companies after being shirked in regards to the identity theft.

I have enclosed the following documents to substantiate my claims : 1. FTC Identity Theft Report.

2. Police Report and associated case number provided by XXXX  XXXX XXXX that is : XXXX. 
3. Illinois Attorney General Identity Theft Affidavit.

4. Correspondence between myself, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, and Blitt and Gaines P.C.

5. The final checking account statement from XXXX  XXXX XXXX, the last XXXX card statement ( ending in XXXX ), and XXXX  XXXX XXXX notices showing fraudulent disputes on the account. 
XXXX. XXXX dispute information, along with XXXX and XXXX credit reports showing the aforementioned inaccuracies. 
7. A response from the Illinois Attorney General regarding this matter to Blitt and Gaines P.C.

This situation of identity theft has caused significant harm to my reputation and credit health. The failure to investigate and resolve these inaccuracies constitutes negligence under the FCRA.

I request the following actions from your agency : 1. Remove the Resolved FCBA notation and the Consumer disputes after resolution comment from my credit reports, as they are inaccurate and misleading.

2. Update the reports to reflect that I am actively disputing this account on this date of receipt, with supporting documentation provided.

I have been contacted by Zion Debt Holdings regarding a debt that they claim I owe. However, I believe this debt is being collected illegally for the following reasons : 1. **Lack of Licensing** : I have reason to believe that Zion Debt Holdings is not properly licensed to collect debts in Delaware. Under Delaware law, all debt collectors must be licensed to operate in the state, and I request that the CFPB investigate their licensing status.

2. **Failure to Validate Debt** : I have requested validation of the debt, including an original contract between myself and Zion Debt Holdings XXXX As per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I am entitled to receive this validation. Despite my requests, I have not received any documentation proving that I owe this debt or that Zion Debt Holdings has the right to collect it. 

3. **Cease and Desist** : I hereby request that Zion Debt Holdings cease all collection activities until they provide the requested validation. If they continue to pursue this debt without providing proof, I will consider this harassment and a violation of my rights under the FDCPA.

4. **Removal from Credit Report** : Additionally, I request that any accounts related to this alleged debt be removed from my credit report. Since I have not received validation of this debt, it should not be reported as accurate or valid.

5. **Legal Action** : I would like to inform you that if this matter is not resolved promptly, I will take legal action against Zion Debt Holdings for their unlawful practices, including but not limited to failure to validate the debt and potential violations of state and federal debt collection laws.

I kindly request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Zion Debt Holdings to ensure compliance with debt collection laws. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and keep me informed of any actions taken.

So I did it after I sent it and told them my account said XXXX they hung up. I disputed this with chime about XXXX to 4 times. They always said it was declined, I gave the money to a friend, the people that investigate dont have phones where they are. Needless to say I never got my money back and it was almost XXXX dollars. So to read and find out its fdic insured and I didnt have to struggle makes me very irate. I am a single mom of XXXX kids I shouldnt have been treated that way and I would like my money back.",,Chime Financial Inc,NY,12144,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11155357

2024-12-14,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","I was sent an email from the XXXX and the White House stating that I qualified for early forgiveness if switched to the SAVE plan since my original amount borrowed was under a certain amount ( under $ XXXX plus a year for every $ XXXX over that amount ). I submitted and switched on XX/XX/year> which was acknowledged by XXXX and my servicer ( edfinancial ) I should have been included in the wave of forgiveness in XXXX, however Edfinancial failed to process my application in a timely manner and I was passed over for forgiveness. I had multiple chats with Edfinancial in which they acknowledged they had the application, but it was not processed. Unfortunately, they did not process my application until XXXX and the injunction happened not that long after. So now I have missed out on forgiveness that I should have received. I received a letter from them last week acknowledging they did receive my application on XX/XX/year> but failed to process it until XXXX and that they were retroactively applying a forbearance during that time. Unfortunately that also added additional interest to my balance that was not there previous to this letter. I just want to know what options I have, as I should have had my balance forgiven in the XXXX XXXX  and now instead I am stuck in limbo with the SAVE plan being challenged-especially since I only switched to Save because I was told I would get immediate forgiveness.",,EdFinancial Services,CT,060XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11156975
2024-12-14,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I am keeping a log of both my monthly payments as well as additional payments I make in between monthly payments. Interest is 6.830 % accruing daily, which I am factoring in and logging each time I make a payment. My monthly payment is {$370.00}. I pay an average of $ XXXX/month. Each month, the balance increases rather than reduces. For example since XXXX, Edfinancial shows my balance {$400.00} more then my ledger of payments. The difference is not the interest because I am calculating the interest daily and including that amount, daily, as noted above. ( How can I be paying {$100.00} MORE per month than my established monthly payment, yet have an increasing balance? If I was not keeping a detailed, personal, daily log of this, I would not have noticed it. But the numbers do not add up and each time I have called, the representatives I have spoken to also could not explain the reasoning in how the money was being applied. They were only able to offer to send me, by snail mail, a copy of the list of all the payments I have made. This does nothing to address the discrepant amounts/balances after the payments have been made. So I have no recourse if the amounts are wrong (?? ) I do not know where their balance number is coming from. It doesnt add up correctly. I want them to explain how the more I pay, the higher my balance gets.",,EdFinancial Services,GA,30277,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11156904
