SERVICE WAS NOT DELIVERED The merchant clearly stated in a letter that was sent back to Capital One that the tickets were CANCELLED!! 

I want Capital one to DO their job. Refund my money now. You have no reason to hold my money, the merchant sent you proof in writing that they cancelled the ticket. Your response to me via writing is incorrect. 

The tickets were cancelled on XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX  event was XXXX XXXX. A person can not accuse another person of committing wrong in the future. That is ludicrous and under no law acceptable. Hence XXXX  can not accuse anyone of being a vendor and pretending to be a healthcare professional when the date of the event haven't even arrived.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, to ask for permission to rent out our property while we are away. I was told as long as it is at least XXXX -months lease, I am allowed to rent out. 

I also ask for the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX, I was told it is not yet generated. Therefore, they assisted me to set up my email XXXX in the system so I can receive the bills and documents and all communications while I go to foreign country. They helped me reset the online account to make payment when the statement was available. I also asked for a copy of XXXX XXXX  and received a copy of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the email that they just set up. 

While in XXXX, I only received a few messages about the XXXX  meetings.. I have never received any communication about my bills. I had trouble logging in to the XXXX  payment portal and it was also difficult to make phone calls back to the XXXX to reach someone in XXXX. 

Around XX/XX/XXXX, I finally found the XXXX phone number that I was able to talk to a live representative. I tried to get help because the XXXX XXXX new payment system did not take my payment. I was told that my account was blocked and I was placed in collection with XXXX XXXX. I argued that I have never received any email about my bills being behind, however, the office XXXX refused to talk to me and she instructed me to discuss with XXXX XXXX because the account is sold to them. 

I contacted XXXX to ask for the breakdown and they sent me the bill with my XXXX  amount due is {$410.00} for XX/XX/XXXX and {$910.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, plus their collection fees, the total amount is {$7700.00}. 

I explained to them that I want to pay for my XXXX  due, but not their collections fees because I have never received any notice from them nor the XXXX about how much I owe. 

The XXXX is currently denied to take my payments, as well as upcoming XXXX assessments. I have to make the payment will XXXX XXXX. Thus, if I do not pay {$7700.00}, I do not have any way to pay my assessments due with knowing it will clear my XXXX  account. My XXXX fee is supposed to be bill {$410.00} semi-annually. 

I requested XXXX to send me something in writing that when I make {$2400.00} ( I believe this will cover all my assessments from XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ), and confirm with me that money will go to the HOA account and I disputed their Collection fees because I have not received any contact from the XXXX nor XXXX XXXX before. 
However, I keep getting misleading statements with higher and higher collection bills over time.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AZ XXXX Subject : Dispute of Charge-Off Account in my Credit Report Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to dispute certain inaccurate information that appears on my credit report. The items in question are related to alleged charge-off accounts, which I believe are incorrect and misleading. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), I have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information in my credit file. In compliance with this act, I formally dispute the following charge-off accounts : Account Number : XXXX Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX The reason for the dispute is the documents that were sent to me were for the original lease I havent received the new lease that they state is from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

Please investigate these matters and correct the disputed items as soon as possible. If you need additional information to resolve this dispute, kindly contact me at your earliest convenience. 

I would also like to highlight that under Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA, the entities providing this information to you have an obligation to correct, VALIDATE, VERIFY and update relevant information to ensure its accuracy. If they have failed to do so, they may be in violation of the FCRA and in turn these accounts need to be deleted from my consumer file immediately if they cant be validated and verified.

In addition, according to Section 623 ( b ) of the FCRA, upon receipt of my dispute, you must notify the information provider of my dispute. If you find that any of these accounts are indeed inaccurate, incomplete, or can not be verified or validated, I kindly request their immediate removal as per Section 605 of the FCRA, which stipulates that any information that is found to be inaccurate or can no longer be verified or validated must be removed from a consumer 's credit file. If you cant provide me with the original contract with my wet ink signature, and the name and title of the person you spoke to about the above listed accounts showing validation and verification please delete the above listed account Lastly, I want to draw your attention to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) amendment to the FCRA, which provides me the right to obtain one free copy of my credit report in cases where a change has been made as a result of the dispute.

I have attached a copy of my credit report with the disputed items highlighted for your convenience. Please provide a detailed response to my dispute in writing within 30 days of receipt of this letter, as required by the FCRA. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

This wasn't much of a surprise because I had a negative balance of XXXX dollars ( and thats the reason my account closed in XXXX this year because even though i didnt know i could even overdraft on my account..since it was overdrafted for 33 days they closed my XXXX XXXX XXXX account thats never been negative bc i probably aged out of the non overdraft student account but i digress... i logged into my mobile banking on the XXXX day because they sent an email that if i was negative for much longer after 20 days that i would be fined..no notice of account closer and no warning from app! I was ready to pay the fines not deal with account closer ) so fast forward a couple months to the present day XXXX took their money and supposedly sent a check to my last address on file ... is what I was told by a Santander representative on the phone on the XXXX. 

My surprise came in because I had called Santander on XX/XX/XXXX asking about the check but a representative had then told me that no open accou ts were found so there's no way a check was routed and it had to bounce. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX confirmed a transfer or check number to Santander with my info. 

The Santander representative that I spoke to told me that the check had to be en route because "" They have 10 days to send the check. '' By that Day it was the XXXX business day ( taking away XXXX for XXXX ) or XXXX business day, so I had started to ADVIDLY watch for the mail... today is XX/XX/XXXX and there still has been no check in the mail or confirmation that it's been at least canceled in anticipation of it being rerouted to a Santander branch for my pick up. 

So because this payment was sent from my job on/around XX/XX/year> and I was in anticipation of the moniess... XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I called Santanders XXXX number to try to cancel the check and pick it up at a branch and a Santander representative said that it might best to do this all at a branch. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I went to the XXXX XXXX branch in MA and the branch manager advised me she could help me, not the worker, asked for my story again about trying to cancel the check, then got on the phone with the "" back office '' as I retold them my issue for the third time she assured me that the back office would be able to handle it. She gave me her card to email her. 


On XX/XX/XXXX I checked in through email and she replied "" Thank you. I have submitted a request for you. As soon as I hear from the department that handles this request I will inform you of next steps. 
XXXX XXXX Branch Manager '' On XX/XX/XXXX she emailed me that she was "" still awaiting a response from the processing team to see if I could pick up the check at a branch, '' so I wouldn't have to play this mail game anymore. 

My email lost storage so I emailed her from a different email on XX/XX/XXXX asking if they've ( processing team? ) updated her with anything and she said that she "" had just emailed them again and included her district executive. '' I've received no correspondence from Santanders Ach team or any back office for clarification, the branch manager being an ignorant middleman might not be the best course of action. Im turned off that the systems that should've alerted me to a check on the way even with my closed account were not in effect and that's the start to this issue, because with the check not arriving in the mail... it's on my mind that its been cashed.

Still, these companies have yet to respond to me with verifiable documentary proof, original consumer contract, or similar proof bearing my wet ink signature on it, 30 days went by. I received nothing from these companies and these accounts were reinserted with no permissible purpose and without my consent. 

As outlined in the FCRA, failure to provide documented and verifiable proof within the specified time frame obligates the removal of unverified, invalid, derogatory accounts and information from my consumer report. Despite the receipt of my dispute letter and the lapse of 30 days, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX  have neither provided the requested proof nor rectified the inaccuracies in the reported information. They didnt respond to me at all and therefore by law, I'm demanding the deletion of these accounts on my credit report immediately. 

XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX claimed to have completed a reasonable investigation with the furnisher of information and verified the accounts listed below as reporting 100 % accurately. However, these accounts are still inaccurate and are continuing to report errors on my credit file, violating my rights and damaging my credit score at the same time.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Unfair Late Payment Reporting by XXXX  XXXX XXXX Dear CFPB, I am filing this complaint regarding an unfair negative remark on my credit report caused by XXXX  XXXX XXXX failure to process my account closure request properly. Despite multiple attempts to resolve this matter with the bank and Experian, the issue remains unresolved, and I am requesting your assistance in addressing this violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Details of the Issue In XX/XX/year>, I requested the closure of my XXXX  XXXX XXXX account via a phone call. At the time of my request, the account balance was XXXX. I was assured that the account would be closed. However, due to the bank 's failure to process my closure request, the account remained open, and I was subsequently charged two {$15.00} fees. These fees resulted in late payments being reported to the credit bureaus, unfairly damaging my otherwise exceptional payment history. 

I have disputed these late payments with Experian, requesting verification of their accuracy. Experian has responded, claiming the information is accurate. However, the negative remarks on my credit report are the direct result of XXXX  XXXX XXXX failure to process my account closure request as promised, making this reporting unfair and inaccurate. 

Impact These unfairly reported late payments have caused a significant drop in my credit score and tarnished my impeccable credit history. This is unjust, given that the fees and subsequent late payments resulted solely from the banks error in failing to close my account as instructed. 

What I Am Requesting I request the CFPBs assistance to : 1Investigate this matter with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and Experian. 
2Require XXXX  XXXX XXXX to remove the late payment reports from my credit history across all major credit bureaus. 
3Ensure compliance with the FCRA and prevent further harm to my creditworthiness.

Supporting Documentation I have attached : A summary of my account history, including the timeline of the account closure request. 
Copies of correspondence with Experian regarding the dispute. 
My Experian credit report showing the late payment remarks. 

Conclusion I believe this issue stems from XXXX  XXXX XXXX error and failure to act on my account closure request, making the late payments unjust and inaccurate. I appreciate the CFPBs attention to this matter and look forward to a resolution that restores the accuracy of my credit report. 

Thank you for your assistance.

I have previously sent certified dispute letters to these companies to rectify my credit report 's inaccuracies and ensure compliance with the FCRA. Still, this company has yet to respond to me with verifiable documentary proof of the accuracy of these late payments. Thirty days went by I received nothing from this company and these late payments were reinserted with no permissible purpose and without my consent. 

As outlined in the FCRA, failure to provide documented and verifiable proof within the specified time frame obligates the removal of unverified, invalid, derogatory information from my consumer report. Despite the receipt of my dispute letter and the lapse of 30 days, XXXX XXXX  has not provided the requested proof nor rectified the inaccuracies in the reported information. They didnt respond to me at all and therefore by law, I'm demanding the deletion of these late payments on my credit report immediately. 

XXXX XXXX  claimed to have completed a reasonable investigation with the furnisher of information and verified the late payments listed below as reporting 100 % accurately. However, these late payments are still inaccurate and are continuing to report errors on my credit file, violating my rights and damaging my credit score at the same time. According to The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information on a consumer 's credit report should be consistent across all three bureaus, as creditors and lenders may use any of the three to check a consumer 's credit history. XXXX XXXX  did not remove the inaccurate late payments furnished on my consumer file, and I have never given my consent to re-insert or furnish these late payments. No consent is Identity Theft. 

I formally request XXXX and EXPERIAN to update these late payments to paid on time never late on my credit report, as per the provisions of the FCRA. The failure of these companies to validate the inaccuracies within the statutory timeframe signifies their non-compliance with federal regulations and warrants the removal of the disputed accounts.

Thankfully, these inquiries are not attached to open accounts, but their presence on my credit report is highly concerning.

Under the FCRA, I am entitled to know the permissible purpose under which these companies accessed my credit report. I demand validation for each inquiry, including documentation bearing my signature, authorizing these entities to perform a credit inquiry. 

If these inquiries can not be validated or verified, I demand their immediate removal from my credit report to prevent further harm to my creditworthiness and privacy.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"I am writing to dispute an inaccurate item on my credit report under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The account referenced above is reported as charged off, yet it also shows an outstanding balance. This reporting is both inconsistent and potentially misleading. 

According to standard accounting practices and regulatory guidance, when an account is charged off, the creditor has written off the balance as a loss. Reporting both a charge-off and an outstanding balance is improper, as the debt is no longer active on their books. This error adversely affects my credit standing and must be corrected immediately. 

To support my claim, I am requesting the following : 1. Verification of the balance being reported.

2. Evidence that the creditor has retained the right to report a balance on this charged-off account.

If you are unable to verify the accuracy of this account or the reported balance, I demand that this account either be updated to reflect a {$0.00} balance or removed entirely from my credit report. 

I have enclosed documentation relevant to this dispute : [ Include any receipts, account statements, or correspondence related to the charge-off or balance dispute. ] As required by law, you have 30 days to investigate and resolve this dispute. Please confirm receipt of this letter and provide written documentation of your findings once the investigation is complete. 

Failure to resolve this matter promptly will result in my filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and potentially seeking legal action to protect my credit rights. 

I expect your swift attention to this matter. Thank you for your cooperation.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,MS,39208,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11246551

Please delete the following items from my credit report immediately ADDRESSES INQUIRES NAMES ACCOUNTS COLLECTIONS These accounts should not appear on my consumer report, as they are the result of identity theft. Please ensure these fraudulent accounts are removed as required under the law.

This account contains inaccuracies, disputed charges, and information related to identity theft. Furthermore, NFCU 's handling of my billing dispute and related inquiries has been unprofessional and in violation of multiple federal and state laws. Relevant Legal Violations : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 Under the FCRA, I have the right to request the removal of fraudulent or inaccurate information from my credit report. NFCU has failed to correct inaccuracies related to this account, specifically refusing to remove it despite its connection to identity theft and unauthorized charges. Violation : NFCUs refusal to remove this fraudulent information from my credit report violates my rights under the FCRA. Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) 15 U.S.C. 1666 The FCBA requires creditors to promptly investigate billing disputes and provide written explanations of their findings. NFCU failed to conduct a thorough investigation regarding a { {$1000.00} } debit card charge associated with this account and did not provide an adequate explanation. Violation : NFCUs mishandling of the billing dispute violates the FCBA 's investigation and dispute resolution provisions. Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) 15 U.S.C. 1693f The EFTA governs the resolution of unauthorized electronic fund transfers. The { {$1000.00} } charge is unauthorized, and NFCU has not investigated or reversed the transaction, despite my provision of sufficient documentation. Violation : NFCU has violated the EFTA by failing to investigate and resolve unauthorized charges as required by law. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 U.S.C. 1692c The FDCPA prohibits unfair and deceptive collection practices, including reporting inaccurate or disputed debts. NFCU continues to report this account as charged off or past due, despite the ongoing dispute, which has harmed my credit score and financial standing. Violation : NFCUs reporting of this account as delinquent, despite the ongoing dispute, constitutes a violation of the FDCPA. Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act ( CSPA ) Ohio Rev. Code 1345.02 The Ohio CSPA prohibits suppliers from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or unconscionable acts in consumer transactions. NFCUs failure to investigate my billing dispute and unauthorized charges, along with their lack of clear communication, falls under deceptive practices as defined by Ohio law. Violation : NFCUs conduct constitutes unfair and deceptive practices under the Ohio CSPA. Ohio Identity Theft Law Ohio Rev. Code 2913.49 Ohio 's identity theft laws protect consumers from the adverse effects of fraudulent information. NFCU has refused to correct or remove fraudulent information from my credit report, which continues to harm my financial standing. Violation : NFCUs refusal to remove identity theft-related information from my credit report violates Ohios identity theft law. Summary of Violations : Inaccurate Information Reporting ( FCRA ) : NFCU has failed to remove inaccurate information despite evidence of its connection to unauthorized charges and identity theft. Failure to Investigate Billing Disputes ( FCBA ) : NFCU has not properly investigated my billing dispute. Unauthorized Charges ( EFTA ) : The { {$1000.00} } charge is unauthorized, and NFCU has failed to investigate or reverse it. Unfair Debt Collection Practices ( FDCPA ) : NFCU continues to report the account as delinquent despite the ongoing dispute. Deceptive Practices ( Ohio CSPA ) : NFCUs mishandling of my dispute and failure to correct inaccuracies constitute unfair practices. Failure to Correct Identity Theft Information ( Ohio Identity Theft Law ) : NFCUs refusal to remove identity theft-related information is unlawful. Desired Outcome : Immediate Deletion of the NFCU Account : I request that NFCU be required to delete this disputed account from my credit report across all credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). This account contains fraudulent charges and disputed information that have not been resolved appropriately. Reimbursement of { {$1000.00} } for Unauthorized sharing of non public information to a third party : I seek reimbursement for the { {$1000.00} } unauthorized sharing of non public information to a third party. If NFCU can not provide this reimbursement, I request that they block and delete the account from my credit report immediately. Correction of Credit Report : NFCU must notify all credit bureaus of the account deletion and ensure that any derogatory marks related to this account are permanently removed from my credit file. Conclusion : I trust that the CFPB will take prompt action to ensure my rights as a consumer are upheld. NFCU has failed to follow federal and state laws in handling my dispute and reporting accurate information. I respectfully request the CFPB 's assistance in resolving this matter and ensuring that NFCU corrects the ongoing damage to my credit report.

Despite prior disputes, the inaccuracies remain unresolved, and I am requesting proof of the previous investigation or immediate deletion of this account from my credit reports due to its unverifiable nature. 

Account Details : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX  Account Number : [ Insert Account Number ] Discrepancies Identified Across Credit Reports : 1. Account Balance : XXXX & Experian : {$5400.00} XXXX : {$5300.00} Discrepancy : Conflicting balances across credit bureaus. 
2. Date of Last Activity : XXXX & Experian : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX Discrepancy : The conflicting dates indicate inaccurate and inconsistent reporting. 
3. Last Payment Date : XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX Experian : Not reported. 
Discrepancy : Inconsistent last payment dates among bureaus. 
4. Payment Status : XXXX XXXX Experian : XXXX XXXX : Late XXXX  Days Discrepancy : Differing payment statuses create confusion about the true state of the account. 
5. Dispute Status : XXXX & Experian : Account not disputed XXXX : Consumer disputes- reinvestigation in progress Discrepancy : Conflicting information on whether or not the account is currently disputed. 
6. Credit Limit : All three bureaus report a credit limit of {$3600.00}, yet the high balance exceeds this limit, raising questions about the accuracy of reporting. 

Request for Proof of Investigation : I am now requesting : 1. Proof of the previous investigation conducted by the credit bureaus and XXXX XXXX. 
2. A detailed method of the investigation, including : Records of who you spoke with.

Their business address, name, and phone number.

3. Documentation proving the validity of the account balance, payment history, and charge-off status.

If this information can not be provided within three ( 3 ) days, I am demanding the immediate deletion of this account from all three credit reports and an updated credit report reflecting the removal of the inaccurate information.

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The continued discrepancies and lack of verifiable documentation violate the FCRA by : 1. Reporting inaccurate and conflicting information.

2. Failing to validate disputed entries.

3. Falsely reporting payment activity and account status.

Resolution Requested : 1. Immediate deletion of the XXXX XXXX account from my credit reports if proper validation can not be provided. 


Impact on Me : The ongoing discrepancies have caused significant harm to my credit score, limiting my ability to access financial opportunities. This is unfair, misleading, and a violation of my rights under the FCRA. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving proof of the investigation or an updated credit report reflecting the deletion of this account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,VA,235XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11240207

Key Issue with Capital One Handling : On XX/XX/year>, I spoke with two different Capital One managers. One manager stated that I still had time to dispute the charge, while another claimed the dispute window had expired on XX/XX/year>.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"Dear Credit Reporting Agency, I am writing to formally dispute the continued reporting of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account ( Account # XXXX ) on my credit report. The information being reported is inaccurate, unverifiable, and constitutes multiple violations of my rights under federal and state laws. 

a. False or Misleading Representations ( 15 U.S.C. 1692e ) If XXXX continues to report the debt as collectible despite it being charged off or forgiven, this constitutes false representation. 
Failure to clarify the status of the debt, especially if it was canceled or forgiven, is misleading. 
b. Failure to Cease Collection on Disputed Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ) If a debt is disputed, the collector ( or creditor, in this case ) must cease all collection activityincluding reporting to CRAsuntil the debt is validated. If the dispute has been ignored or dismissed without validation, this is a violation. 
XXXX. Misrepresentation of Debt Status a. Inaccurate Reporting of Balance Reporting a balance greater than {$0.00} on a charged-off account misrepresents the account status. A charge-off means the creditor has deemed the debt uncollectible and written it off, so the balance should reflect {$0.00} unless sold to a collection agency. 
b. Violation of Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ), creditors must provide accurate billing and disclosure. If the reported balance is inconsistent with the charge-off classification, this violates TILA.

Additionally, the reporting of a non-zero balance on a charged-off account is inaccurate and misleading. If this account has been charged off, the balance should reflect {$0.00}, as required under proper credit reporting standards. 

Violations of My Rights XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) I submitted dispute letters dated XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/year>, requesting documentation to validate this account, including : Authenticated double-entry accounting records. 
Original signed agreements or contracts.

A copy of the 1099-C form ( if applicable ).

You failed to conduct a reasonable investigation and instead relied solely on unverifiable information provided by the creditor. 
Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), if disputed information can not be verified, it must be deleted from the credit report. 
XXXX. Failure to Provide Documentation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ) ( 1 ), you are required to provide all information in the consumers file upon request. Despite my repeated demands, you have failed to provide : Proof of validation.

Documentation supporting the charge-off classification.

A copy of the 1099-C form required under 26 U.S.C. 6050P if the debt has been canceled or forgiven. 
Your failure to produce these documents violates this provision. 

XXXX. Reporting Inaccurate and Inconsistent Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) Credit reporting agencies must ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. 
XXXX has already removed this account as unverifiable, yet you continue to report it inaccurately. This inconsistency among credit reporting agencies directly violates 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

Further, if this account has been charged off, the balance must be reported as {$0.00}, as the creditor no longer considers it collectible. Reporting a non-zero balance on a charged-off account is both inaccurate and misleading.

4. Continuing to Report Unverifiable Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ) You are required to delete any information that can not be verified within 30 days. It has been over 50 days since my initial dispute, and you have failed to provide proper validation.

This is a direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), as you continue to report unverifiable information despite my multiple requests.

5. Violation of Consumer Disclosure Rights ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( f ) ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( f ), you are required to include a notation that an account is disputed. If this dispute notation is missing from my credit report, you are in violation of this provision.

6. Failure to Issue a 1099-C Form ( 26 U.S.C. 6050P ) If this account was charged off and is considered forgiven or canceled, the creditor was required to issue a 1099-C form for debts exceeding {$600.00}. The absence of this form raises questions about the validity of the charge-off and its reporting. 
XXXX. Violation of Permissible Purpose ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ) If XXXX XXXX XXXX or the credit reporting agency can not produce signed contracts proving my authorization, the continued reporting of this account may constitute a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which governs permissible purposes for reporting information. 
XXXX. Illegal Re-Aging of Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) If the Date of First Delinquency ( DOFD ) on this account has been altered to make the debt appear newer than it is, this constitutes illegal re-aging.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ), negative accounts must be removed from credit reports after seven years from the XXXX. 
XXXX. Inadequate Explanation of Reinvestigation Results ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ), credit reporting agencies are required to provide a description of the reinvestigation process and the procedure used to verify disputed information. Simply stating that the account was verified by the creditor without providing supporting documentation does not satisfy this requirement. 
Immediate Actions Required XXXX. Failure to Remove Data Breach-Related Accounts ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( a ), I am entitled to request the removal of any account resulting from a data breach. I informed you that my information was compromised in a data breach, and this account is directly tied to the fraudulent use of my information. You have failed to comply with your obligation to remove this unverifiable and fraudulent account. 

XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), you are required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information and provide documentation verifying the accuracy of the account.

I requested authenticated double-entry accounting records, original signed contracts, and a 1099-C form if the debt was charged off, forgiven, or canceled. 
Your failure to produce this documentation demonstrates that the account can not be verified, making its continued reporting a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ). 
XXXX. Reporting Inaccurate Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) Credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information in consumer reports. 

XXXX has already removed this account from my credit file as unverifiable, yet you continue to report it inconsistently. 
Additionally, if this account has been charged off, the balance must reflect {$0.00}. Reporting a non-zero balance is inaccurate and misleading, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). 
XXXX. Failure to Block Fraudulent Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( b ) ) Under FACTA and 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( b ), you are required to block disputed information related to a data breach or identity theft within four business days after receiving evidence of the breach. Your failure to block or remove this account constitutes a violation of my rights under this provision.

XXXX. Failure to Provide Consumer Disclosures ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) I requested copies of all information related to the disputed account, including contracts, applications, and validation records, under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ). You have failed to provide these documents, violating my right to access information in my file. 

XXXX. Failure to Issue a 1099-C Form ( 26 U.S.C. 6050P ) If the account has been charged off or canceled, XXXX XXXX XXXX was required to issue a 1099-C form to both me and the IRS for debts exceeding {$600.00}. The absence of this form raises questions about the validity and accuracy of the charge-off and makes the reporting of this account fraudulent. 

XXXX. Violation of FTC Data Security Standards As part of my FTC complaint, I reported that my information was exposed in a data breach. Your continued failure to investigate or remove accounts linked to this breach constitutes unfair and deceptive practices under FTC standards, as well as a breach of your obligation to safeguard consumer data. 

Remove the Account : Since you have failed to provide proper validation, this account must be deleted from my credit report immediately in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ).

Update the Balance to {$0.00} : If you continue to report this account, it must reflect a {$0.00} balance, as required for charged-off accounts. 
Provide Validation Documentation : If you intend to continue reporting this account, provide the following within 10 days : Authenticated double-entry accounting records. 
Original signed agreements or contracts.

A copy of the 1099-C form, if applicable. 
Notice of Escalation If you fail to take the necessary corrective actions or provide proper documentation, I will escalate this matter by : Filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for violations of the FCRA. 
Reporting the issue to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) for failure to issue a 1099-C form.

Consulting with legal counsel to pursue claims for statutory and actual damages under 15 U.S.C. 1681n ( willful noncompliance ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681o ( negligent noncompliance ).

I trust you will address this matter promptly and ensure compliance with your obligations under federal law. Please confirm the removal or correction of this account within 10 days.

In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I request an immediate investigation into the following discrepancies and the removal of any unverifiable or incorrect data. This communication also serves as a pre-arbitration notice in the event that this matter is not resolved in accordance with applicable laws and consumer protections. 
Disputed Information : Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Numbers : XXXX and XXXX Discrepancies Identified : Multiple Entries : The same debt appears multiple times with slight variations in account numbers and details, which is misleading and potentially damaging. Status Inconsistencies : One entry lists the account as "" Open, '' while another indicates it is "" Closed, '' creating confusion about the actual status. Activity Dates : There are conflicting last activity dates between the entries, raising questions about the accuracy of the reported information. Lack of Payment History : The absence of payment history on these accounts does not provide a complete picture and may misrepresent my creditworthiness. Inconsistent Comments : Some entries lack detailed comments, while others include remarks such as "" Account Seriously Past Due Date, '' leading to potential misinterpretation. Legal Basis for Dispute : Under the FCRA, consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in their credit reports. Specifically : Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Mandates that credit reporting agencies must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation if a consumer disputes the accuracy of information. Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) : Requires the deletion or modification of information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable after reinvestigation. Additionally, case law such as Dalton v. Capital Associated Industries , Inc., 257 F.3d 409 ( 4th Cir. 2001 ), underscores the importance of reasonable reinvestigation by credit reporting agencies. Failure to comply with these standards may constitute a violation of the FCRA and open the agency to liability. Supporting Documentation : I have enclosed copies of my credit report highlighting the disputed entries, along with any relevant correspondence and documentation that support my claim. Please review these documents as part of your investigation. 

Pre-Arbitration and Litigation Notice : Should this dispute remain unresolved, I reserve the right to pursue remedies under arbitration or litigation. If an arbitration provision is applicable under any agreement between us, I will initiate arbitration proceedings. Be advised that arbitration may incur the following costs, which could become your responsibility in the event of an adverse decision against your agency : Filing Fees : Up to {$200.00}, per the rules of most arbitration forums, unless waived for financial hardship. Administrative Fees : Between {$750.00} and {$1500.00}, depending on the arbitration provider. Arbitrator Fees : Ranging from {$1500.00} to {$3500.00} or more for multi-session arbitrations. If no arbitration provision applies, I will pursue this matter through litigation, seeking all remedies provided under the FCRA, including but not limited to statutory damages, actual damages, punitive damages, and the reimbursement of attorneys fees and legal costs. 

Requested Action : I urge you to : Conduct a thorough investigation into the disputed entries. Delete or correct any information that is found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable. Provide me with a written statement detailing the outcome of your investigation. Furnish me with an updated copy of my credit report reflecting any changes made. 

Conclusion : Inaccurate information on my credit report can have serious implications for my financial well-being. I trust that you will address this matter with the urgency and diligence it requires, ensuring compliance with the FCRA and safeguarding my rights as a consumer. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response within 30 days, as stipulated by the FCRA.

This ongoing issue has caused considerable emotional and financial strain, and I am hopeful that your office can assist in resolving this matter promptly. Understanding the Impact As a consumer, I expect that the credit bureaus will follow the law and act in good faith to ensure the accuracy of my credit report. Unfortunately, my recent experience has demonstrated the exact opposite. After filing multiple disputes regarding unauthorized and inaccurate accounts on my credit report, I have been met with repeated non-responses and a lack of follow-through. This has resulted in a growing sense of anxiety and frustration, as my creditworthiness continues to be impacted by errors that I can not control.

It is extremely disheartening to feel like the credit bureaus, entities entrusted with the responsibility of managing consumer credit, are ignoring or disregarding my rights. This situation has left me feeling powerless and as though my concerns are not being treated with the urgency and seriousness they deserve.

Request for Intervention and Assistance I understand that the CFPBs role is to ensure that credit bureaus adhere to consumer protection laws, and it is with this in mind that I humbly request your intervention.

Specifically, I am asking the CFPB to take action to ensure that credit bureaus are held accountable for their failure to : 1. Properly investigate my disputes within the legally required 30-day period under 15 U.S.C. 1681i of the FCRA.

2. Maintain the accuracy and integrity of the information reported, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

3. Take swift action to block fraudulent or unauthorized information on my credit report under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2.

The emotional toll of dealing with inaccurate credit reporting is often underestimated, but it is a real and ongoing burden that affects both my daily life and long-term financial stability. I sincerely hope that the CFPB can help ensure that credit bureaus fulfill their duties to consumers, providing a timely and fair resolution to this issue.

I am grateful for your time and attention to this matter, and I trust that the CFPB will take the necessary steps to ensure that credit bureaus act in compliance with consumer protection laws. I look forward to your response and appreciate any guidance or support you can offer as I navigate this challenging situation.

Thank you for your understanding and for the work you do to protect consumers like me.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Reporting XXXX  ( Report Number : XXXX ) Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate and misleading information being reported by XXXX  on my credit report. The details of the account are as follows : Details of the Disputed Account : Account Name : XXXX  Account Number : XXXX Account Type : Auto Loan Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Status : Repossession ( {$8100.00} past due as of XX/XX/XXXX ) Original Balance : {$18000.00} This account contains several inaccuracies and reporting issues that violate federal credit reporting standards. 

Grounds for Dispute : 1. Repossession Reporting : The account status indicates a repossession dating back to XX/XX/XXXX, yet the payment history lists ongoing repossession statuses through XX/XX/XXXX. This creates a misleading representation of the account. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, creditors are required to furnish accurate and consistent data.

2. Inconsistent Payment History : The payment history redundantly lists repossession for multiple months ( e.g., XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and prior months ), creating confusion and potential over-reporting of derogatory marks. This redundant reporting must be corrected. 

XXXX. Validation of Debt and Balance : The current balance of {$8100.00} is inconsistent with prior communications regarding the debt. XXXX has not provided adequate documentation to validate the amount owed, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i.

4. Failure to Correct Prior Dispute : This account was previously disputed, as noted in the reinvestigation details dated XX/XX/XXXX. However, XXXX failed to fully address or correct the inaccuracies identified in the dispute, violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Requested Resolution : 1. Remove Duplicate Repossession Entries : Correct the payment history to eliminate redundant repossession statuses for months following the initial repossession in XX/XX/XXXX. 

2. Validate the Debt and Balance : Provide a detailed validation of the {$8100.00} balance, including a breakdown of charges, payments, and fees. If the debt can not be validated, delete the account entirely from my credit report.

3. Ensure Compliance with FCRA : Verify that all reporting related to this account complies with federal regulations, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ). 

4. Amend Credit Reporting : Update the accounts reporting to accurately reflect its status and remove any redundant or misleading information. 

I am requesting the CFPBs assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that DriveTime/Bridgecrest complies with its legal obligations. Please confirm receipt of this dispute and provide updates regarding your investigation. 

Thank you for your assistance.

2024-12-22,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Application denials,"Regarding Loan # XXXX serviced by "" The Mr. Cooper Group '' formerly Nationstar Mortgage Company. I have been subjected to unfair practices since XX/XX/XXXX, when they acquired the mortgage from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I have repeatedly been a victim of unfair practices from this company and its employees, I have fulfilled every request that they asked for, paid for all the trial modifications and submitted all required paperwork except for my ex-wife 's signature I am estranged from my ex-wife, and she has refused to communicate with me since she left the house in the year XXXX about 21 years ago. The Mr. Cooper Group falsely claimed that her signature was necessary for my loan modification. To my surprise it was not required, as evidenced by the guidelines of XXXX XXXX and clarified by the court decision in an order to show cause granted dated XXXX XXXX, by Honorable Judge XXXX XXXX XXXX , Index # XXXX. 
The court stated : "" Here, Plaintiff has improperly interpreted XXXX XXXX guidelines, among other things, and erroneously refused to accept and approve the loan modification applications submitted by XXXX XXXX XXXX. Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has not demonstrated its right to proceed with this case. '' The malicious business practices that "" The Mr. Cooper Group '' has perpetrated, has made it exceedingly difficult for me to deal with. They are solely interested in foreclosing on my home. I have attached numerous complaints and lawsuits and class action lawsuits that The Cooper Group, formerly Nationstar Mortgage, has accumulated over the years.

My concern is that The Mr. Cooper Group has consistently claimed to have not received my applications and other correspondences through mail, fax, or website uploads, and has imposed unfair fees as a result. I have attached all supporting documents stating thecontrary. After this, I also requested extra time to gather all the required documents. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, The Mr. Cooper Group scheduled my residence for auction without proper cause or proper jurisdiction ( see attached court order ). They failed to notify me of the sale, which is a violation of my rights. Supporting documents prove that I have sent the applications through various means on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, including faxes, website upload attempts, and The Mr. Cooper XXXX website messages. 

To compound matters, in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, The Mr. Cooper Group stated, "" We found that our prior reviews for modification assistance do not show that we requested XXXX XXXX ' Signature for a workout assistance. Our records show that XXXX XXXX has not accepted an approved request for modification assistance previously. '' This is totally false. I made every good faith attempting to rectify this situation dating back to year XXXX until the present ( even through XXXX shutdowns ). Look at all the documents attached stating the contrary. 

Besides wrongfully denying my numerous loan modification applications along with what appears to be unnecessary assorted fees, Mr. Cooper now has come up with another underhanded tactic in order to frustrate me concerning my latest application. The Mr. Cooper Group required me to provide a profit and loss statement about my business. I provided The Mr. Cooper Group with the profit and loss statement for the time period requested. It was submitted in printed form. with the exhibits along with the XX/XX/XXXX, The Mr. Cooper Group letter and Mr. Cooper 's XXXX XXXX, letter concerning the profit a loss statement submitted in response to the XX/XX/XXXX letter. I was told by The Mr. Cooper Group that they were not accepting my profit and loss statement as submitted. Instead, if you can believe it, The Mr. Cooper Group told me I have to submit the profit and loss statement in handwritten form. This is just another absurd example of the tactics used by The Mr. Cooper Group to frustrate me at every step in the application process. 
Also there has been multiple changes in single point of contacts from The Mr. Cooper Group since the beginning of the year to my loan in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, these arc other ways, so I get confused and no one to blame for not receiving my applications. Attached are letters of change of representatives, please read the complaints I'm not alone. 
Over the years, the Mr. Cooper Group has added more legal fees, inspection fees, default notices filing fees, and administrative fees my loan. These fees are largely unexplained and I believe they are unreasonable and inflated. For example, in XX/XX/XXXX, my account was charged {$12000.00}. 

I dispute all these legal fees from The Mr. Cooper Group as well the huge amount of legal fees from foreclosure and bankruptcy attorneys, fees and interest, which I have incurred while defending my XXXX daughters and my wife from the many evictions. I was forced to file for bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure proceedings in order for my family to have a roof over their head. It has been a painful experience not knowing what to expect, and l have spent thousands of dollars defending myself. All of this has contributed to my high mortgage ( balance due to accrued fees ). Attached are some of the fees that I could gather, although they do not encompass I requested a complete "" escrow analysis and corporate advances, '' legal fees, property inspection fees, extra legal fees, default notices, forbearance fees and suspend etc. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX was informed by XXXX XXXX, my single point of contact for "" The Mr. Cooper Group '' that it should only take 3 days to obtain, if not 5 days tops to date I have not received this requested documentation. Please look at the statements attached and detail below for reference : from years XXXX XXXX, Nationstar Mortgage charged me for legal fees with property inspections and other fees each month as follows : I have no idea what "" disbursement suspend '' on XX/XX/XXXX statement means, totaling {$14000.00}? so I need the expertise of the attorney general to decipher the charges on my loan mortgage since The Mr. Cooper XXXX refuses to provide me with the statements. 
These are the only legal fees I could identify until I get my full records, Mr. Cooper group has not sent any account statements to me, and he has only disclosed XXXX ( but not every detail on those years and months ) in The Mr. Cooper 's Group Website, I'm missing many of statements, and I can only XXXX what other fees were applied over the years and what they have charged my account, attached are all the loan modifications I have been wrongfully denied since XXXX, except for the XXXX modification which The Mr .

Cooper Group wrongly claimed that I refused on XX/XX/XXXX. This is not accurate due to the CARES ACT related to XXXX. My loan modification was unexecuted because of this forbearance. I spoke to The Mr. Cooper XXXX at that time, and I have attached a letter stating that The Mr. Cooper Group that allowed XXXX forbearance. However, they now claim that I made no payments during that period, despite the letters of forbearance, since our family of XXXX was significantly affected by XXXX. 
My request is to be able to get back all fees and charges from all those years that they have wrongfully denied, including attorney 's fees, and the interest that has accrued over the years, and the created fees that were wrongfully applied to my loan so that I can qualify for the Homeowner 's Assistance Fund at XXXX, which I desperately need. 
I patiently waited XXXX years for HAF to call me, and when they finally did, I submitted my application. They subsequently denied my application due to high balanced caused by the excessive fees charged to my mortgage account. In conclusion, Mr. Cooper has placed outrageous fees and interest on my loan balance, making it impossible for loan modification. There delay in reviewing me for a modification has also put my HAF application in jeopardy. Pursuant to HAF, if The Mr. Cooper Group would allow me a modification the {$95000.00} from HAF could be used as a good faith down payment. These delays and issues need to be addressed. My pain and suffering from this are greater than I can recover, but with your help and fairness, I hope to see that The Mr. Cooper Group is held accountable for their repeated malicious mistakes that continue to damage my family! 
Ultimately, my goal is to have a loan modification approved after all the improper fees and interests are credited to my loan balanced. On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted documents that The Mr. Cooper Group requested, and they rejected them. In the past, all my loan modifications were approved without any documentation.

Please help me to deal with this disturbing process, I thank you in advance for your efforts of your department. this unfair behavior must cease. The practice of adding extra fees over the years has been unjustly applied to my loan, not to mention the fear of losing my home by the malicious practices from The Mr. Cooper Group. now Rushmore servicing Please feel free to reach out if you need any further assistance or clarification and extra supporting documents.

It was approved on line for only {$1700.00}. I expected at least a {$10000.00} credit line and searched on line for a customer service phone number. After calling that number ( XXXX ) their response was that I had to, first, finish a request for a free gift worth {$200.00}. I repeatedly told them my issue and that I did NOT want a free gift. After some badgering and bullying, I finally relented, was passed off to another call and they wanted some other info, including a checking account number and the bank name and routing number. After some argumentation, I reluctantly and finally gave them that info. They gave me a code number to give back to the previous caller to complete the "" verification ''. When passed back to him, he asked for the code. I changed my mind and hung up on him. It just didn't feel right. I looked up the number I called and finally traced it to : XXXX XXXX, XXXX TX, which SEEMED legit. It still seemed fishy. So in order to precisely protect our check acct., I called my bank 's Fraud Hotline. We came up with/ this solution : 1. Block the checking account from ANY DEBIT TRANSACTIONS. 2. open a new checking account in person ( it'll have a DIFFERENT acct. number ). 3. Transfer all money to the new acct., and 4. completely close the old account. Meanwhile advise any company involved w/ deposits or debits of the new account number. I thank God for urging me to call the bank fraud line. I DO know better than to EVER give out bank and/or checking account info. I was just badgered HARD to relent so I could get answers to my credit limit inquiry.

2024-12-22,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Formal Complaint & Dispute Inconsistent Reversal Notifications, Resulting Late Fees, and Damaged Credit To Whom It May Concern at the CFPB and Capital One : I am writing in reference to my Capital One Platinum Card ( account ending in XXXX ) to formally dispute the negative outcomes stemming from multiple reversed payments in XXXX and XX/XX/year>. While Capital One has claimed these reversals resulted from Insufficient Funds, my core contention is that Capital One failed to provide consistent or timely returned payment notifications, depriving me of the ability to promptly address any account shortfall or technical issue.

Background : Payment Attempts & Reversals XX/XX/year> {$68.00} payment, reversed on or about XX/XX/XXXX I did eventually receive a returned email noticethough it arrived days later, after late fees were assessed. 
XX/XX/year> {$68.00} payment, reversed on or about XX/XX/XXXX I did receive a reversal email on XX/XX/XXXX, which was again post-late-fee, preventing me from rectifying the situation in a timely manner. 
XX/XX/year> {$120.00} payment, reversed on XX/XX/XXXX I have no record whatsoever of any returned payment email or notification. 
XX/XX/year> {$570.00} payment, reversed on XX/XX/XXXX I also have no returned payment notice for this reversal. 
In each case, I did receive emails about the payment being scheduled and posted, which reasonably led me to believe the payments cleared successfully. Without a prompt reversal notice, I was unaware the account remained unpaidleading to late fees, negative credit reporting, and the eventual closure of my account. 
Why This Is Unfair ( UDAAP & Regulation Z Concerns ) Inconsistent Notifications : Capital Ones own patternsometimes sending a reversal email days late, sometimes sending none at allconstitutes inadequate disclosure.

Unfair & Deceptive Acts or Practices ( UDAAP ) : Consumers must be clearly informed if a payment is reversed so they can take corrective action. Failing to do so, or doing so inconsistently, causes avoidable harm ( late fees and credit damage ).

Regulation Z ( Truth in Lending ) : Requires that changes to a credit account ( including reversed payments leading to a past due status ) be disclosed in a timely, clear manner. If I never received or only belatedly received these notices, that disclosure obligation was not met.

Financial Ability & Willingness to Pay Ample Funds : I have provided XXXX  XXXX XXXX statements ( and other documents ) proving I had the financial means to cover these payments. Even if there was a legitimate NSF on the specific linked account, I had more than enough funds in my broader finances to rectify any shortfall immediatelyif only I had been notified. 
No Intent to Default : My payment history across multiple accounts shows I am not in the habit of missing payments. These reversals were entirely unexpected due to the lack of timely communication from Capital One. 

Negative Outcomes Late Fees & Interest : Imposed because I inadvertently remained past due, unaware the payments were reversed.

Damaged Credit : Late/missed payment reporting to the credit bureaus negatively impacted my credit score.

Account Closure : Capital One ultimately closed my account, citing business concerns allegedly unrelated to my creditworthinessyet it was triggered by the repeated returned payments.

Requested Resolution Removal/Correction of Negative Credit Entries Because these negative marks arose from inadequate or missing notifications, I request that Capital One correct my credit reports, removing any late-payment notations connected to the reversed payments.

Refund of Late Fees & Interest I ask that all late fees and interest charges stemming from these reversals be refunded or credited, as I was not given a fair opportunity to remedy the situation.

Documentation of Email Notices I request a comprehensive timeline from Capital One showing each date/time they claim a returned payment email was sent, along with any proof ( e.g., server logs or headers ) demonstrating successful delivery.

Reinstatement of Account ( If Applicable ) If possible, I ask Capital One to consider reinstating my account ( under normal terms ) given that these past-due incidents were precipitated by faulty or late communicationnot an unwillingness or inability to pay.

Conclusion and Complaint Summary My chief complaint : Capital Ones inconsistent reversal notification process caused me to unknowingly remain delinquent, incurring fees and negative credit marks. Had I received timely, reliable notices of these reversals, I would have promptly covered any shortfall from my ample financial resources. I strongly believe this situation constitutes unfair and deceptive practices under UDAAP and violates the spirit of Regulation Zs disclosure requirements.

I respectfully request that both the CFPB and Capital One review this matter carefully. I look forward to a fair resolution that acknowledges the communication failures in reversing my payments and restores my account standing and credit file to an accurate, fair state.

During the call, one of their phone agents informed me that my account was four months delinquent and that the financial hardship agreement I entered into on XX/XX/XXXX, had never been approved. This news shocked me, as my past due amount had grown to over {$1400.00}.

When I entered into the financial hardship agreement on XX/XX/XXXX I was in good standing. Under this agreement : I was to pay XXXX XXXX  monthly for six months on the XXXX  of each month at 0 % interest. 
The monthly payments were to be deducted automatically from my checking account. 
I agreed not to use my BofA Visa card for the duration of the agreement.

I also received a confirmation letter outlining the terms of the agreement.

I had followed all of these terms. However, the agent could not explain how my account became delinquent despite the automatic withdrawals I had authorized. He apologized for the inconvenience, stated he did not know why it was not approved after the agreement had already been issued, and offered me a new financial assessment instead of a resolution.

I pushed for answers, explaining that I had made all the required payments on time and had never been notified that there were any issues. I had even called Bank of America twice since entering into the agreement, and neither time did either of the phone agents mention any problems with my account. Specifically in XX/XX/XXXX, I called to ask if I could pay more than my monthly {$140.00}. I initially reached the outgoing BofA recording stating my balance and became alarmed upon hearing that my account was past due. I expressed concern when I was eventually connected to an agent and asked her if this was true, explaining that I had recently been put on a payment plan. She told me the recording was likely an error and confirmed my payments were current and my account was in good standing.

On my XX/XX/XXXX call, I told the first agent I spoke with that I had received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX outlining the agreements terms, as well as a letter received on XX/XX/XXXX, stating my final payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX ( the latter being the catalyst for my phone call ). Yet, Bank of America failed to notify me that the hardship agreement had not been approved or inform me that my account had become past due ( despite my previous two calls to the bank ). Neither agent on XX/XX/XXXX asked me to verify my contact information to see why I had not received any notifications regarding the status of my account or the change in status of my financial hardship agreement. 

Additionally, I told the agent that I had lived up to my side of the agreement in terms of not using my BofA XXXX. In fact, I had even let my card expire because I was so adamant about not breaching my part of the agreement with BofA. The agent asked me if I received a notification about my credit card being canceled and I thought it was because my credit card was expiring so I disregarded it. I was determined to not use this card and use this opportunity to pay down my debt with a 0 % interest rate until XXXX, XXXX. 

During my call on XX/XX/XXXX, the first agent conducted a financial assessment, but the call was subsequently disconnected. I called back and was connected to a different agent, who explained that they could not identify the prior agent and did not keep records of who handled my call. 

The second agent reviewed my case and concluded that the agent who had set up my financial hardship agreement in XXXX acted in error. She explained that the agent did not have the authority to issue the agreement and should have offered financial counseling instead. At this point, I was in disbelief. I had lived up to my end of the agreement, only to discover that the agreement with BofA was never valid and my account had accumulated interest, finance charges, and late fees over the past XXXX months. Furthermore, my past due amount had ballooned to over {$1400.00}. 

This agent asked if I wanted to proceed with another new financial assessment. In tears, I agreed. After placing me on hold several times, she returned with XXXX options : Pay 80 % of my total balance ( approximately {$11000.00} ) by XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX months from now ). I explained that being on XXXX leave and not currently working, I could not afford to pay this much money in this timeframe while I was paying a mortgage and not earning an income. It seemed like lunacy to even suggest this as an option. 

Credit counseling I was given a phone number, and when I asked who the credit counseling service was, the agent only said that BofA worked with several different credit counseling services. It was ambiguous who I would be working with, and I was suspicious if they would have my best interest at XXXX or would try to exploit me again, as I was already feeling quite vulnerable from my financial hardship agreement not being honored. 

When I asked if there was anything Bank of America could do for me immediately, she suggested I call back in a few days or later in the month. This response was confusing : why would Bank XXXX XXXX hardship protocol change in a matter of days? What are the variables? What determined the threshold? 

In frustration and out of fear, I paid $ XXXX months worth of paymentsover the phone using money from my savings account which I use to pay my mortgage. Despite this, my account remains delinquent, and I owe a past-due amount that I can not afford at this time. If BofA had honored the agreement it made with me on XX/XX/XXXX, my account would be current, as all monthly payments we agreed upon have been withdrawn automatically from my account each month. 

I firmly believe Bank XXXX XXXX actions constitute a bait-and-switch tactic, a conflict of interest, or, at best, gross negligence and exploitation. Bank of America continued to charge interest, finance charges, and late fees while withdrawing the agreed-upon {$140.00} payments from my account. I was not notified, warned, or given any opportunity to rectify the situation until it was too late. I am requesting that BofA honor the original agreement set up on XX/XX/XXXX and refund me the late fees and finance charges incurred as a result of their error. I also request that my credit report be adjusted to reflect no delinquency on my part.

I have previously sent certified dispute letters to these companies to rectify my credit report 's inaccuracies and ensure compliance with the FCRA. Still, this company has yet to respond to me with verifiable documentary proof of the accuracy of these late payments. Thirty days went by I received nothing from this company and these late payments were reinserted with no permissible purpose and without my consent. 

As outlined in the FCRA, failure to provide documented and verifiable proof within the specified time frame obligates the removal of unverified, invalid, derogatory information from my consumer report. Despite the receipt of my dispute letter and the lapse of 30 days, XXXX XXXX has not provided the requested proof nor rectified the inaccuracies in the reported information. They didnt respond to me at all and therefore by law, I'm demanding the deletion of these late payments on my credit report immediately. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX claimed to have completed a reasonable investigation with the furnisher of information and verified the late payments listed below as reporting 100 % accurately. However, these late payments are still inaccurate and are continuing to report errors on my credit file, violating my rights and damaging my credit score at the same time. According to The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information on a consumer 's credit report should be consistent across all three bureaus, as creditors and lenders may use any of the three to check a consumer 's credit history. XXXX XXXX did not remove the inaccurate late payments furnished on my consumer file, and I have never given my consent to re-insert or furnish these late payments. No consent is Identity Theft. 

I formally request TRANSUNION and XXXX to update these late payments to paid on time never late on my credit report, as per the provisions of the FCRA. The failure of these companies to validate the inaccuracies within the statutory timeframe signifies their non-compliance with federal regulations and warrants the removal of the disputed accounts.

Motor Vehicle Record ( MVR ) : I was informed that my rate was updated based on driver-history details, including a record of an incident dated XX/XX/year> ( Failure to yield, stop, comply, or yield to pedestrian ).

3. Transparency and Compliance : The notice stated, Take note that your Final Price is subject to underwriting verification. However, it did not adequately explain the specific underwriting criteria used to determine the rate change. 
I am concerned about the transparency of how my information was used and whether this decision complies with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

My Requests : 1. A detailed explanation of how my MVR and insurance score specifically influenced the price revision.

2. Verification of the accuracy of the information used in determining my premium.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Reporting XXXX  ( Report Number : XXXX ) Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate and misleading information being reported by XXXX  on my credit report. The details of the account are as follows : Details of the Disputed Account : Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Account Type : Auto Loan Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Status : Repossession ( {$8100.00} past due as of XX/XX/XXXX ) Original Balance : {$18000.00} This account contains several inaccuracies and reporting issues that violate federal credit reporting standards. 

Grounds for Dispute : XXXX. XXXX XXXX : The account status indicates a repossession dating back to XX/XX/XXXX, yet the payment history lists ongoing repossession statuses through XX/XX/XXXX. This creates a misleading representation of the account. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, creditors are required to furnish accurate and consistent data.

2. Inconsistent Payment History : The payment history redundantly lists repossession for multiple months ( e.g., XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and prior months ), creating confusion and potential over-reporting of derogatory marks. This redundant reporting must be corrected. 

3. Validation of Debt and Balance : The current balance of {$8100.00} is inconsistent with prior communications regarding the debt. XXXX has not provided adequate documentation to validate the amount owed, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i.

4. Failure to Correct Prior Dispute : This account was previously disputed, as noted in the reinvestigation details dated XX/XX/XXXX. However, XXXX failed to fully address or correct the inaccuracies identified in the dispute, violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Requested Resolution : 1. Remove Duplicate Repossession Entries : Correct the payment history to eliminate redundant repossession statuses for months following the initial repossession in XX/XX/XXXX. 

2. Validate th

e Debt and Balance : Provide a detailed validation of the {$8100.00} balance, including a breakdown of charges, payments, and fees. If the debt can not be validated, delete the account entirely from my credit report. 3. Ensure Compliance with FCRA : Verify tha
t all reporting related to this account complies with federal regulations, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ).

4. Amend Credit Reporting : Update the accounts reporting to accurately reflect its status and remove any redundant or misleading information.

I am requesting the CFPBs assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that DriveTime/Bridgecrest complies with its legal obligations. Please confirm receipt of this dispute and provide updates regarding your investigation.

Account Details : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : [ Insert Account Number ] Discrepancies Identified Across Credit Reports : 1. Account Balance : TransUnion & XXXX : {$5400.00} XXXX : {$5300.00} Discrepancy : Conflicting balances across credit bureaus.

Discrepancy : Inconsistent last payment dates among bureaus.

4. Payment Status : TransUnion XXXX XXXX : Collection/Chargeoff XXXX  : Late XXXX  Days Discrepancy : Differing payment statuses create confusion about the true state of the account.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Subject : Formal Dispute of Credit Reporting XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint and dispute regarding inaccurate and misleading information reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX on my credit report. The information provided below does not accurately reflect the circumstances of my account, and I am requesting your assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring compliance with federal credit reporting laws. 

Details of the Disputed Account : Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Account Type : Auto Loan ( Joint Responsibility with XXXX XXXX ) Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  Reported Status : Charged off ( {$16000.00} written off ; {$16000.00} past due as of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ) Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Grounds for Dispute : 1. Charge-Off Reporting : The charge-off and balance information ( {$16000.00} ) is being reported inaccurately. Under 15 U.S.C. 1666b and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, creditors are required to report only accurate and verifiable information. I have not received sufficient validation for this debt or evidence justifying the charge-off amount. 

2. Repossession Reporting : The account history indicates a repossession in XX/XX/XXXX, but the vehicle was redeemed. Per UCC 9, Part 6, repossessions followed by redemption must not continue to be reported inaccurately. 

3. Duplicate Reporting of Negative Events : The account history redundantly lists late payments, repossession, and charge-off statuses from XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  through XX/XX/XXXX. These entries appear to overlap and create an unfair representation of the accounts status. 

4. Compliance with FCRA and Investigation Obligations : I previously disputed this account, as noted in the comment section of my credit report. However, the reinvestigation completed in XX/XX/XXXX failed to address all errors comprehensively, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681i and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2. 

Requested Resolution : 1. Delete the inaccurate charge-off reporting and balance information.

2. Remove the repossession entry, as the vehicle was redeemed, per applicable law.

3. Ensure compliance with federal regulations, including proper validation of the debt and correction of redundant and inaccurate reporting. 

I am requesting the CFPBs assistance in ensuring that XXXX XXXX XXXX complies with its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and related statutes. Please confirm receipt of this dispute and provide updates regarding the investigation. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

XXXX Subject : 2nd Request for Assistance Regarding Credit Bureau Non-Compliance with Consumer Laws To CFPB Representative, I am writing to convey my serious concerns and frustration regarding the credit bureaus continued failure to comply with their legal obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This ongoing issue has caused considerable emotional and financial strain, and I am hopeful that your office can assist in resolving this matter promptly. 
Understanding the Impact As a consumer, I expect that the credit bureaus will follow the law and act in good faith to ensure the accuracy of my credit report. Unfortunately, my recent experience has demonstrated the exact opposite. After filing multiple disputes regarding unauthorized and inaccurate accounts on my credit report, I have been met with repeated non-responses and a lack of follow-through. This has resulted in a growing sense of XXXX  and frustration, as my creditworthiness continues to be impacted by errors that I can not control. 

It is extremely disheartening to feel like the credit bureaus, entities entrusted with the responsibility of managing consumer credit, are ignoring or disregarding my rights. This situation has left me feeling powerless and as though my concerns are not being treated with the urgency and seriousness they deserve. 

Request for Intervention and Assistance I understand that the CFPBs role is to ensure that credit bureaus adhere to consumer protection laws, and it is with this in mind that I humbly request your intervention. Specifically, I am asking the CFPB to take action to ensure that credit bureaus are held accountable for their failure to : 1. Properly investigate my disputes within the legally required 30-day period under 15 U.S.C. 1681i of the FCRA.

2. Maintain the accuracy and integrity of the information reported, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

3. Take swift action to block fraudulent or unauthorized information on my credit report under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2. 

The emotional toll of dealing with inaccurate credit reporting is often underestimated, but it is a real and ongoing burden that affects both my daily life and long-term financial stability. I sincerely hope that the CFPB can help ensure that credit bureaus fulfill their duties to consumers, providing a timely and fair resolution to this issue. 

Conclusion I am grateful for your time and attention to this matter, and I trust that the CFPB will take the necessary steps to ensure that credit bureaus act in compliance with consumer protection laws. I look forward to your response and appreciate any guidance or support you can offer as I navigate this challenging situation. 

Thank you for your understanding and for the work you do to protect consumers like me.

My name is XXXX XXXX, and I have been actively monitoring my credit reports. I recently disputed a late payment on my XXXX credit report on XX/XX/year>, which was fully investigated and resolved by XXXX. On XX/XX/year>, XXXX removed the disputed late payment from my report after concluding that it was inaccurate and unverifiable. 

As a result of this update, I respectfully request that you review my credit report, specifically the account in question, and remove the unverifiable late payment that is currently being reported by your bureau. If XXXX has deemed the late payment to be unverifiable and has removed it from my credit report, the same logic should apply to your investigation of this account. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information on their credit reports. Specifically, Section 1681i of the FCRA requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable investigation when a dispute is made and to remove any information that can not be verified. If the late payment in question is not verifiable, it must be removed from my credit file.

Moreover, under Section 1681e ( b ) of the FCRA, credit bureaus are required to maintain accurate and up-to-date information on consumer credit reports. If any information is found to be unverifiable, it is in violation of my rights as a consumer, and I am entitled to have it removed.

I kindly request that you remove this unverifiable late payment from my credit report within 30 days from the receipt of this letter. Failure to do so will result in further action, including but not limited to filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and taking legal action, including potential claims under the FCRA, for failing to comply with my rights to accurate credit reporting.

If the late payment is not removed within 30 days, I will be forced to explore all available legal options, including filing a lawsuit for damages related to the inaccurate reporting. Under the FCRA, consumers are entitled to seek statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees for violations of the Act.

Please acknowledge receipt of this request and provide me with a response within the required 30-day period. I expect your prompt attention to this matter and trust you will comply with the law.

Thank you for your time and cooperation.

I previously submitted an official complaint to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) concerning unauthorized inquiries appearing on my credit report. The complaint was filed on XXXX XXXX, under FTC Reference Number XXXX. 
Complaint Description : My credit report reflects unauthorized inquiries that were made without my explicit consent. I have contacted the creditors responsible for these inquiries, and they have confirmed they possess no evidenceneither written nor verbalthat I authorized or initiated these inquiries. This clear lack of valid authorization constitutes a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
I have formally demanded the immediate removal of these inquiries, as they are baseless and negatively impact my credit profile. However, the credit bureau in question has failed to provide a satisfactory resolution or appropriate action. This failure to address unauthorized inquiries prompted me to escalate the matter by filing a formal complaint with the FTC. I urge the immediate removal of these illegitimate inquiries to ensure compliance with federal regulations and to restore the integrity of my credit report. 

Details of Disputed Inquiries : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have attached a copy of the formal complaint submitted to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to further support this claim. This document highlights the absence of my authorization for these inquiries and underscores the insufficient response provided by the credit bureau, reinforcing my request for the immediate removal of these unauthorized inquiries from my credit report. 
Formal Request : I am formally requesting a thorough and manual investigation of the disputed inquiries and their removal if there is no verifiable documentation. I reserve the right to take legal action and file an additional complaint with the CFPB and my state 's Attorney General.

In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I request an immediate investigation into the following discrepancies and the removal of any unverifiable or incorrect data. This communication also serves as a pre-arbitration notice in the event that this matter is not resolved in accordance with applicable laws and consumer protections. 
Disputed Information : Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Numbers : XXXX and XXXX Discrepancies Identified : Multiple Entries : The same debt appears multiple times with slight variations in account numbers and details, which is misleading and potentially damaging. Status Inconsistencies : One entry lists the account as "" Open, '' while another indicates it is "" Closed, '' creating confusion about the actual status. Activity Dates : There are conflicting last activity dates between the entries, raising questions about the accuracy of the reported information. Lack of Payment History : The absence of payment history on these accounts does not provide a complete picture and may misrepresent my creditworthiness. Inconsistent Comments : Some entries lack detailed comments, while others include remarks such as "" Account Seriously Past Due Date, '' leading to potential misinterpretation. Legal Basis for Dispute : Under the FCRA, consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in their credit reports. Specifically : Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Mandates that credit reporting agencies must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation if a consumer disputes the accuracy of information. Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) : Requires the deletion or modification of information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable after reinvestigation. Additionally, case law such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, underscores the importance of reasonable reinvestigation by credit reporting agencies. Failure to comply with these standards may constitute a violation of the FCRA and open the agency to liability. Supporting Documentation : I have enclosed copies of my credit report highlighting the disputed entries, along with any relevant correspondence and documentation that support my claim. Please review these documents as part of your investigation.

Pre-Arbitration and Litigation Notice : Should this dispute remain unresolved, I reserve the right to pursue remedies under arbitration or litigation. If an arbitration provision is applicable under any agreement between us, I will initiate arbitration proceedings. Be advised that arbitration may incur the following costs, which could become your responsibility in the event of an adverse decision against your agency : Filing Fees : Up to {$200.00}, per the rules of most arbitration forums, unless waived for financial hardship. Administrative Fees : Between {$750.00} and {$1500.00}, depending on the arbitration provider. Arbitrator Fees : Ranging from {$1500.00} to {$3500.00} or more for multi-session arbitrations. If no arbitration provision applies, I will pursue this matter through litigation, seeking all remedies provided under the FCRA, including but not limited to statutory damages, actual damages, punitive damages, and the reimbursement of attorneys fees and legal costs.

Requested Action : I urge you to : Conduct a thorough investigation into the disputed entries. Delete or correct any information that is found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable. Provide me with a written statement detailing the outcome of your investigation. Furnish me with an updated copy of my credit report reflecting any changes made. 

Conclusion : Inaccurate information on my credit report can have serious implications for my financial well-being. I trust that you will address this matter with the urgency and diligence it requires, ensuring compliance with the FCRA and safeguarding my rights as a consumer. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response within 30 days, as stipulated by the FCRA.

Transunion response, claiming that the accounts were "" verified as accurate, '' raises significant questions about the methods employed in your investigation. It is evident that your process is flawed, as the reporting on these accounts contains blatant inaccuracies that have not been questioned or corrected. 
Accounts in Dispute : XXXX. XXXX XXXX. XXXX  Violations and Concerns : XXXX. XXXX Account : o The account inconsistently reports charge-offs in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. How can these discrepancies coexist for the same account? This contradiction should have been flagged and addressed in any legitimate investigation. 
o The account reports 120 days late repeatedly in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX of XXXX, which defies logical reporting practices. Your lack of scrutiny into such an obvious inconsistency is unacceptable. 
o The account has been re-aged as recently as XX/XX/XXXX. Re-aging an account without justification is a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section XXXX. This action is both deceptive and detrimental to my credit score. 
XXXX. XXXX Account : o This account has been reported as "" charged off '' every month since XX/XX/XXXX. A charged-off account can not continue reporting monthly as charged offit is a one-time status. 
o The account was also re-aged to XX/XX/XXXX, which violates the FCRAs provisions for accurate and timely reporting under Section 605.

Legal Violations : FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : You failed to conduct a proper reinvestigation of the disputed information, allowing XXXX and XXXX to provide inaccurate and contradictory reporting. 
FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Credit furnishers must provide accurate information. By accepting conflicting data from these furnishers without question, you are complicit in their violations.

FCRA Section 605 ( c ) : Re-aging an account violates the statute of limitations for reporting adverse items, creating undue harm to consumers.

FCRA Section 607 ( b ) : You are obligated to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy. The errors in these accounts demonstrate a clear lack of such procedures. 
Harm Caused : Your actions and omissions have directly harmed my credit profile, costing me thousands of dollars in interest rates and financial opportunities. It is my legal right to have my accounts reported accurately and fairly. By failing to conduct a thorough investigation, you have disregarded this right. 

If these demands are not met within 15 days, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter. This includes filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and pursuing legal action to protect my rights. Furthermore, I will explore bringing this to media attention to highlight your predatory practices against consumers.

I previously submitted an official complaint to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) concerning unauthorized inquiries appearing on my credit report. The complaint was filed on XXXX XXXX, under FTC Reference Number XXXX. 
Complaint Description : My credit report reflects unauthorized inquiries that were made without my explicit consent. I have contacted the creditors responsible for these inquiries, and they have confirmed they possess no evidenceneither written nor verbalthat I authorized or initiated these inquiries. This clear lack of valid authorization constitutes a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
I have formally demanded the immediate removal of these inquiries, as they are baseless and negatively impact my credit profile. However, the credit bureau in question has failed to provide a satisfactory resolution or appropriate action. This failure to address unauthorized inquiries prompted me to escalate the matter by filing a formal complaint with the FTC. I urge the immediate removal of these illegitimate inquiries to ensure compliance with federal regulations and to restore the integrity of my credit report. 

Details of Disputed Inquiries : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX I have attached a copy of the formal complaint submitted to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to further support this claim. This document highlights the absence of my authorization for these inquiries and underscores the insufficient response provided by the credit bureau, reinforcing my request for the immediate removal of these unauthorized inquiries from my credit report. 
Formal Request : I am formally requesting a thorough and manual investigation of the disputed inquiries and their removal if there is no verifiable documentation. I reserve the right to take legal action and file an additional complaint with the CFPB and my state 's Attorney General.

The account referenced above is reported as charged off, yet it also shows an outstanding balance. This reporting is both inconsistent and potentially misleading. 

According to standard accounting practices and regulatory guidance, when an account is charged off, the creditor has written off the balance as a loss. Reporting both a charge-off and an outstanding balance is improper, as the debt is no longer active on their books. This error adversely affects my credit standing and must be corrected immediately.

To support my claim, I am requesting the following : 1. Verification of the balance being reported.

2. Evidence that the creditor has retained the right to report a balance on this charged-off account. 

If you are unable to verify the accuracy of this account or the reported balance, I demand that this account either be updated to reflect a {$0.00} balance or removed entirely from my credit report. 

I have enclosed documentation relevant to this dispute : [ Include any receipts, account statements, or correspondence related to the charge-off or balance dispute. ] As required by law, you have 30 days to investigate and resolve this dispute. Please confirm receipt of this letter and provide written documentation of your findings once the investigation is complete. 

Failure to resolve this matter promptly will result in my filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and potentially seeking legal action to protect my credit rights.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"Dear Credit Reporting Agency, I am writing to formally dispute the continued reporting of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account ( Account # XXXX ) on my credit report. The information being reported is inaccurate, unverifiable, and constitutes multiple violations of my rights under federal and state laws. 

a. False or Misleading Representations ( 15 U.S.C. 1692e ) If XXXX continues to report the debt as collectible despite it being charged off or forgiven, this constitutes false representation. 
Failure to clarify the status of the debt, especially if it was canceled or forgiven, is misleading. 
b. Failure to Cease Collection on Disputed Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ) If a debt is disputed, the collector ( or creditor, in this case ) must cease all collection activityincluding reporting to CRAsuntil the debt is validated. If the dispute has been ignored or dismissed without validation, this is a violation. 
XXXX. Misrepresentation of Debt Status a. Inaccurate Reporting of Balance Reporting a balance greater than {$0.00} on a charged-off account misrepresents the account status. A charge-off means the creditor has deemed the debt uncollectible and written it off, so the balance should reflect {$0.00} unless sold to a collection agency. 
b. Violation of Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ), creditors must provide accurate billing and disclosure. If the reported balance is inconsistent with the charge-off classification, this violates TILA. 

Additionally, the reporting of a non-zero balance on a charged-off account is inaccurate and misleading. If this account has been charged off, the balance should reflect {$0.00}, as required under proper credit reporting standards. 

Violations of My Rights XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) I submitted dispute letters dated XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>, requesting documentation to validate this account, including : Authenticated double-entry accounting records. 
Original signed agreements or contracts.

A copy of the 1099-C form ( if applicable ).

You failed to conduct a reasonable investigation and instead relied solely on unverifiable information provided by the creditor.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), if disputed information can not be verified, it must be deleted from the credit report. 
XXXX. Failure to Provide Documentation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ) ( 1 ), you are required to provide all information in the consumers file upon request. Despite my repeated demands, you have failed to provide : Proof of validation.

Documentation supporting the charge-off classification.

A copy of the 1099-C form required under 26 U.S.C. 6050P if the debt has been canceled or forgiven. 
Your failure to produce these documents violates this provision. 

XXXX. Reporting Inaccurate and Inconsistent Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) Credit reporting agencies must ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Innovis has already removed this account as unverifiable, yet you continue to report it inaccurately. This inconsistency among credit reporting agencies directly violates 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

Further, if this account has been charged off, the balance must be reported as {$0.00}, as the creditor no longer considers it collectible. Reporting a non-zero balance on a charged-off account is both inaccurate and misleading. 
XXXX. Continuing to Report Unverifiable Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ) You are required to delete any information that can not be verified within 30 days. It has been over 50 days since my initial dispute, and you have failed to provide proper validation.

This is a direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), as you continue to report unverifiable information despite my multiple requests. 
XXXX. Violation of Consumer Disclosure Rights ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( f ) ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( f ), you are required to include a notation that an account is disputed. If this dispute notation is missing from my credit report, you are in violation of this provision. 
XXXX. Failure to Issue a 1099-C Form ( 26 U.S.C. 6050P ) If this account was charged off and is considered forgiven or canceled, the creditor was required to issue a 1099-C form for debts exceeding {$600.00}. The absence of this form raises questions about the validity of the charge-off and its reporting. 
XXXX. Violation of Permissible Purpose ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ) If XXXX XXXX XXXX or the credit reporting agency can not produce signed contracts proving my authorization, the continued reporting of this account may constitute a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which governs permissible purposes for reporting information. 
XXXX. Illegal Re-Aging of Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) If the Date of First Delinquency ( DOFD ) on this account has been altered to make the debt appear newer than it is, this constitutes illegal re-aging. 
Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ), negative accounts must be removed from credit reports after seven years from the XXXX. 
XXXX. Inadequate Explanation of Reinvestigation Results ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ), credit reporting agencies are required to provide a description of the reinvestigation process and the procedure used to verify disputed information. Simply stating that the account was verified by the creditor without providing supporting documentation does not satisfy this requirement. 
Immediate Actions Required 1. Failure to Remove Data Breach-Related Accounts ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( a ), I am entitled to request the removal of any account resulting from a data breach. I informed you that my information was compromised in a data breach, and this account is directly tied to the fraudulent use of my information. You have failed to comply with your obligation to remove this unverifiable and fraudulent account. 

XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), you are required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information and provide documentation verifying the accuracy of the account. 

I requested authenticated double-entry accounting records, original signed contracts, and a 1099-C form if the debt was charged off, forgiven, or canceled.

Your failure to produce this documentation demonstrates that the account can not be verified, making its continued reporting a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ). 
3. Reporting Inaccurate Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) Credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information in consumer reports. 

XXXX has already removed this account from my credit file as unverifiable, yet you continue to report it inconsistently. 
Additionally, if this account has been charged off, the balance must reflect {$0.00}. Reporting a non-zero balance is inaccurate and misleading, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

4. Failure to Block Fraudulent Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( b ) ) Under FACTA and 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( b ), you are required to block disputed information related to a data breach or identity theft within four business days after receiving evidence of the breach. Your failure to block or remove this account constitutes a violation of my rights under this provision.

5. Failure to Provide Consumer Disclosures ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) I requested copies of all information related to the disputed account, including contracts, applications, and validation records, under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ). You have failed to provide these documents, violating my right to access information in my file.

6. Failure to Issue a 1099-C Form ( 26 U.S.C. 6050P ) If the account has been charged off or canceled, XXXX XXXX XXXX was required to issue a 1099-C form to both me and the IRS for debts exceeding {$600.00}. The absence of this form raises questions about the validity and accuracy of the charge-off and makes the reporting of this account fraudulent. 

XXXX. Violation of FTC Data Security Standards As part of my FTC complaint, I reported that my information was exposed in a data breach. Your continued failure to investigate or remove accounts linked to this breach constitutes unfair and deceptive practices under FTC standards, as well as a breach of your obligation to safeguard consumer data. 

Remove the Account : Since you have failed to provide proper validation, this account must be deleted from my credit report immediately in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ).

Update the Balance to {$0.00} : If you continue to report this account, it must reflect a {$0.00} balance, as required for charged-off accounts.

Provide Validation Documentation : If you intend to continue reporting this account, provide the following within 10 days : Authenticated double-entry accounting records.

Original signed agreements or contracts.

A copy of the 1099-C form, if applicable.

Notice of Escalation If you fail to take the necessary corrective actions or provide proper documentation, I will escalate this matter by : Filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for violations of the FCRA.

Reporting the issue to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) for failure to issue a 1099-C form.

Consulting with legal counsel to pursue claims for statutory and actual damages under 15 U.S.C. 1681n ( willful noncompliance ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681o ( negligent noncompliance ).

I trust you will address this matter promptly and ensure compliance with your obligations under federal law. Please confirm the removal or correction of this account within 10 days.

Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation of Disputed Information : On XX/XX/year>, I filed a dispute with TransUnion regarding inaccuracies in my credit report. I explicitly requested a manual review of the disputed information due to its complexity. I provided clear supporting evidence, including highlighted copies of my credit report identifying the errors. However, XXXX used the E-Oscar system to process my dispute electronically rather than conducting the manual review I requested. This process fails to ensure a thorough investigation, as required under the FCRA. 
The response I received was vague and did not provide sufficient detail regarding the methods, sources, or procedures used to verify the disputed information. My specific questions about the investigation process remain unanswered. 
2. Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance by a Collection Agency : 3. Despite my dispute, XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion continue to report this collection account without verifying its validity or requiring the collection agency to issue a 1099-C. This raises questions about the legitimacy of the debt and violates federal regulations. 

Account Name Account Number XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Key Violations : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : o XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) by failing to conduct a manual review of my dispute as explicitly requested. 
o The use of E-Oscar resulted in an inadequate and incomplete investigation. 
2. Failure to Provide Details of Investigation : o XXXX failed to provide the methods, sources, and documentation used in their investigation, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 4 ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ).

3. Inaccurate Reporting and Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance : o XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion continue to report inaccurate information, violating my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

o The collection agencys failure to issue a 1099-C for canceled or forgiven debt violates IRS regulations and raises concerns about the accounts validity.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,30331,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11240047

2024-12-22,Prepaid card,General-purpose prepaid card,Trouble using the card,Trouble using the card to spend money in a store or online,"This complaint is not a duplicate. This is a new complaint based on continued issues with newly purchased card. Gift card was purchased on XX/XX/year> and an attempt to make a purchase were made on XX/XX/year>. Upon use of the card ending in XXXX, transactions were blocked at the merchant and subsequent merchants. It has been determined that there is a systematic scheme in place to purposefully deny use of the cards. I have attempted numerous times to use the card and resolve its issues with Incomm but to no avail. Incomm tells me to use the card at another merchant despite my attempts at different merchants. If a purchase attempt was at a specific merchant, why would one try to use it at another merchant? For example, if I was looking to pay my electric bill with the gift card, why would the solution be to NOT pay the electric bill and pay different merchant? Why am I not allowed to pay my electric company? This same issue is present with previous cards purchased. So instead of more replacement cards, I am respectfully requesting that a check with the purchase fee be sent to my address. Attached is copy of the receipt of the gift card purchase and the gift card itself. 

In response to a previous complaint reply from Incomm regarding a similar issue, the company stated that "" enhanced security measures ... do not appear to function in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX desired capacity ''. I am respectfully requested the specifics on what is the "" desired capacity ''. The gift card package of the product did not have specifics on how and when to spend the funds on the card. Without clear guidance on the package itself, how is a consumer able to know why declined transactions are for the sake of security? Is the intent of the gift card to spend the funds on the card that accepts XXXX? 

Why is it that when a consumer 's transaction is declined access to the funds on the card, that it is the consumer that is responsible to beg and plead to have the funds release for use? Per the letter, declining transactions on the card in addition to declining refund requests of the card itself effectively seals off the ability to use funds on the card. Is the consumer supposedly to simply throw away the card in the garbage if the transaction is declined and forfeit the funds since refunds will no longer be honored at the time of purchase?",,Incomm Holdings Inc.,CT,063XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,No,,11240310

I am looking forward to your swift response and resolution of this matter. If you require any further information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me at the phone number or email address provided above.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am writing to formally dispute the continued reporting of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account ( Account # XXXX ) on my credit report. The information being reported is inaccurate, unverifiable, and constitutes multiple violations of my rights under federal and state laws. 
a. False or Misleading Representations ( 15 U.S.C. 1692e ) If XXXX continues to report the debt as collectible despite it being charged off or forgiven, this constitutes false representation. 
Failure to clarify the status of the debt, especially if it was canceled or forgiven, is misleading.

b. Failure to Cease Collection on Disputed Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ) If a debt is disputed, the collector ( or creditor, in this case ) must cease all collection activityincluding reporting to CRAsuntil the debt is validated. If the dispute has been ignored or dismissed without validation, this is a violation.

2. Misrepresentation of Debt Status a. Inaccurate Reporting of Balance Reporting a balance greater than {$XXXX} on a charged-off account misrepresents the account status. A charge-off means the creditor has deemed the debt uncollectible and written it off, so the balance should reflect {$0.00} unless sold to a collection agency. 
b. Violation of Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ), creditors must provide accurate billing and disclosure. If the reported balance is inconsistent with the charge-off classification, this violates TILA. 

Additionally, the reporting of a non-zero balance on a charged-off account is inaccurate and misleading. If this account has been charged off, the balance should reflect {$XXXX}, as required under proper credit reporting standards. 
Violations of My Rights 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) I submitted dispute letters dated XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>, requesting documentation to validate this account, including : Authenticated double-entry accounting records.

Original signed agreements or contracts. 
A copy of the XXXX form ( if applicable ). 
You failed to conduct a reasonable investigation and instead relied solely on unverifiable information provided by the creditor.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), if disputed information can not be verified, it must be deleted from the credit report.

2. Failure to Provide Documentation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ) ( 1 ), you are required to provide all information in the consumers file upon request. Despite my repeated demands, you have failed to provide : Proof of validation.

Documentation supporting the charge-off classification. 
A copy of the XXXX form required under 26 U.S.C. 6050P if the debt has been canceled or forgiven.

Your failure to produce these documents violates this provision.

3. Reporting Inaccurate and Inconsistent Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) Credit reporting agencies must ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Innovis has already removed this account as unverifiable, yet you continue to report it inaccurately. This inconsistency among credit reporting agencies directly violates 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

Further, if this account has been charged off, the balance must be reported as {$XXXX}, as the creditor no longer considers it collectible. Reporting a non-zero balance on a charged-off account is both inaccurate and misleading.

4. Continuing to Report Unverifiable Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ) You are required to delete any information that can not be verified within 30 days. It has been over 50 days since my initial dispute, and you have failed to provide proper validation.

This is a direct violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), as you continue to report unverifiable information despite my multiple requests.

5. Violation of Consumer Disclosure Rights ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( f ) ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( f ), you are required to include a notation that an account is disputed. If this dispute notation is missing from my credit report, you are in violation of this provision. 
XXXX. Failure to Issue a XXXX Form ( 26 U.S.C. 6050P ) If this account was charged off and is considered forgiven or canceled, the creditor was required to issue a XXXX form for debts exceeding {$600.00}. The absence of this form raises questions about the validity of the charge-off and its reporting. 
7. Violation of Permissible Purpose ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ) If XXXX XXXX XXXX or the credit reporting agency can not produce signed contracts proving my authorization, the continued reporting of this account may constitute a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which governs permissible purposes for reporting information. 
8. Illegal Re-Aging of Debt ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ) If the Date of First Delinquency ( DOFD ) on this account has been altered to make the debt appear newer than it is, this constitutes illegal re-aging.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ), negative accounts must be removed from credit reports after XXXX years from the XXXX. 
9. Inadequate Explanation of Reinvestigation Results ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ), credit reporting agencies are required to provide a description of the reinvestigation process and the procedure used to verify disputed information. Simply stating that the account was verified by the creditor without providing supporting documentation does not satisfy this requirement. 
Immediate Actions Required 1. Failure to Remove Data Breach-Related Accounts ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( a ), I am entitled to request the removal of any account resulting from a data breach. I informed you that my information was compromised in a data breach, and this account is directly tied to the fraudulent use of my information. You have failed to comply with your obligation to remove this unverifiable and fraudulent account.

2. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ) Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), you are required to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information and provide documentation verifying the accuracy of the account.

I requested authenticated double-entry accounting records, original signed contracts, and a XXXX form if the debt was charged off, forgiven, or canceled. 
Your failure to produce this documentation demonstrates that the account can not be verified, making its continued reporting a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ).

3. Reporting Inaccurate Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) Credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information in consumer reports. 

XXXX has already removed this account from my credit file as unverifiable, yet you continue to report it inconsistently. 
Additionally, if this account has been charged off, the balance must reflect {$XXXX}. Reporting a non-zero balance is inaccurate and misleading, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

4. Failure to Block Fraudulent Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( b ) ) Under FACTA and 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ( b ), you are required to block disputed information related to a data breach or identity theft within XXXX business days after receiving evidence of the breach. Your failure to block or remove this account constitutes a violation of my rights under this provision. 
5. Failure to Provide Consumer Disclosures ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) I requested copies of all information related to the disputed account, including contracts, applications, and validation records, under 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ). You have failed to provide these documents, violating my right to access information in my file. 

XXXX. Failure to Issue a XXXX Form ( 26 U.S.C. 6050P ) If the account has been charged off or canceled, XXXX XXXX XXXX was required to issue a XXXX form to both me and the IRS for XXXX exceeding {$XXXX}. The absence of this form raises questions about the validity and accuracy of the charge-off and makes the reporting of this account fraudulent. 

XXXX. Violation of FTC XXXX Security Standards As part of my FTC complaint, I reported that my information was exposed in a data breach. Your continued failure to investigate or remove accounts linked to this breach constitutes unfair and deceptive practices under FTC standards, as well as a breach of your obligation to safeguard consumer data. 

Remove the Account : Since you have failed to provide proper validation, this account must be deleted from my credit report immediately in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ). 
Update the XXXX to {$XXXX} : If you continue to report this account, it must reflect a {$XXXX} balance, as required for charged-off accounts. 
Provide Validation Documentation : If you intend to continue reporting this account, provide the following within 10 days : Authenticated double-entry accounting records. 
XXXX signed agreements or contracts. 
A copy of the XXXX form, if applicable. 
Notice of Escalation If you fail to take the necessary corrective actions or provide proper documentation, I will escalate this matter by : Filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for violations of the FCRA. 
Reporting the issue to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) for failure to issue a XXXX form. 
Consulting with legal counsel to pursue claims for statutory and actual damages under 15 U.S.C. 1681n ( willful noncompliance ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681o ( negligent noncompliance ).

I trust you will address this matter promptly and ensure compliance with your obligations under federal law. Please confirm the removal or correction of this account within 10 days.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Subject : Formal Dispute of Credit Reporting XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint and dispute regarding inaccurate and misleading information reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX on my credit report. The information provided below does not accurately reflect the circumstances of my account, and I am requesting your assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring compliance with federal credit reporting laws. 

Details of the Disputed Account : Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Account Type : Auto Loan ( Joint Responsibility with XXXX XXXX ) Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  Reported Status : Charged off ( {$16000.00} written off ; {$16000.00} past due as of XX/XX/XXXX ) Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Grounds for Dispute : 1. Charge-Off Reporting : The charge-off and balance information ( {$16000.00} ) is being reported inaccurately. Under 15 U.S.C. 1666b and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, creditors are required to report only accurate and verifiable information. I have not received sufficient validation for this debt or evidence justifying the charge-off amount. 

2. Repossession Reporting : The account history indicates a repossession in XX/XX/XXXX, but the vehicle was redeemed. Per UCC 9, Part 6, repossessions followed by redemption must not continue to be reported inaccurately. 

3. Duplicate Reporting of Negative Events : The account history redundantly lists late payments, repossession, and charge-off statuses from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. These entries appear to overlap and create an unfair representation of the accounts status. 

4. Compliance with FCRA and Investigation Obligations : I previously disputed this account, as noted in the comment section of my credit report. However, the reinvestigation completed in XX/XX/XXXX failed to address all errors comprehensively, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681i and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2. 

Requested Resolution : 1. Delete the inaccurate charge-off reporting and balance information.

2. Remove the repossession entry, as the vehicle was redeemed, per applicable law.

3. Ensure compliance with federal regulations, including proper validation of the debt and correction of redundant and inaccurate reporting. 

I am requesting the CFPBs assistance in ensuring that XXXX XXXX XXXX complies with its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and related statutes. Please confirm receipt of this dispute and provide updates regarding the investigation. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Failure to Conduct a Proper Investigation of Disputed Information : On XX/XX/year>, I filed a dispute with XXXX regarding inaccuracies in my credit report. I explicitly requested a manual review of the disputed information due to its complexity. I provided clear supporting evidence, including highlighted copies of my credit report identifying the errors. However, XXXX used the E-Oscar system to process my dispute electronically rather than conducting the manual review I requested. This process fails to ensure a thorough investigation, as required under the FCRA. 
The response I received was vague and did not provide sufficient detail regarding the methods, sources, or procedures used to verify the disputed information. My specific questions about the investigation process remain unanswered. 
2. Failure to Address 1099-C Non-Issuance by a Collection AgencXXXX : XXXX. Despite my dispute, XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX continue to report this collection account without verifying its validity or requiring the collection agency to issue a 1099-C. This raises questions about the legitimacy of the debt and violates federal regulations. 

Account Name Account Number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX DEPTEDXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Key Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation : o XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) by failing to conduct a manual review of my dispute as explicitly requested. 
o The use of E-Oscar resulted in an inadequate and incomplete investigation. 
2. Failure to Provide Details of Investigation : o XXXX failed to provide the methods, sources, and documentation used in their investigation, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 4 ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ).

3. Inaccurate Reporting and Failure to Address
1099-C Non-Issuance : o XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX continue to report inaccurate information, violating my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ).

o The collection agencys failure to issue a 1099-C for canceled or forgiven debt violates IRS regulations and raises concerns about the accounts validity.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30331,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11240590

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Reporting XXXX  ( Report Number : XXXX ) Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate and misleading information being reported by XXXX  on my credit report. The details of the account are as follows : Details of the Disputed Account : Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Account Type : Auto Loan Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Status : Repossession ( {$8100.00} past due as of XX/XX/XXXX ) Original Balance : {$18000.00} This account contains several inaccuracies and reporting issues that violate federal credit reporting standards. 

Grounds for Dispute : 1. Repossession Reporting : The account status indicates a repossession dating back to XX/XX/XXXX, yet the payment history lists ongoing repossession statuses through XX/XX/XXXX. This creates a misleading representation of the account. Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, creditors are required to furnish accurate and consistent data.

2. Inconsistent Payment History : The payment history redundantly lists repossession for multiple months ( e.g., XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and prior months ), creating confusion and potential over-reporting of derogatory marks. This redundant reporting must be corrected. 

3. Validation of Debt and Balance : The current balance of {$8100.00} is inconsistent with prior communications regarding the debt. XXXX has not provided adequate documentation to validate the amount owed, as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681i.

4. Failure to Correct Prior Dispute : This account was previously disputed, as noted in the reinvestigation details dated XX/XX/XXXX. However, XXXX failed to fully address or correct the inaccuracies identified in the dispute, violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Requested Resolution : 1. Remove Duplicate Repossession Entries : Correct the payment history to eliminate redundant repossession statuses for months following the initial repossession in XX/XX/XXXX. 

2. Validate the Debt and Balance : Provide a detailed validation of the {$8100.00} balance, including a breakdown of charges, payments, and fees. If the debt can not be validated, delete the account entirely from my credit report.

3. Ensure Compliance with FCRA : Verify that all reporting related to this account complies with federal regulations, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ).

4. Amend Credit Reporting : Update the accounts reporting to accurately reflect its status and remove any redundant or misleading information. 

I am requesting the CFPBs assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that XXXX complies with its legal obligations. Please confirm receipt of this dispute and provide updates regarding your investigation. 

Thank you for your assistance.

I am requesting the immediate removal of the following items from my consumer credit report in accordance with 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This statute requires that any information identified by the consumer as resulting from identity theft must be blocked from the consumer 's credit report within 4 business days of receipt of my request. It has been over 30 days since my initial request, and you are in violation of this law.

This dispute is not being made in error, nor is it based on any misrepresentation of fact on my part. The information I am disputing is fraudulent, and the entities that reported these items DO NOT have lawful authority to do so. According to the law, these companies are required to have tax documents or other forms of written consent to charge off or report these items under my name. I did not provide such consent, and as such, these items are in violation of my privacy Under 15 U.S. Code 1681b, consumer reporting agencies may only furnish a consumer report in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer. I NEVER provided any written consent for any consumer reporting agency to report the information listed below on my behalf, and their failure to adhere to this law constitutes a clear violation of my rights as a federally protected consumer.

Please delete the following items from my credit report immediately ADDRESSES INQUIRES NAMES ACCOUNTS COLLECTIONS These accounts should not appear on my consumer report, as they are the result of identity theft. Please ensure these fraudulent accounts are removed as required under the law. The companies reporting these items have failed to provide proof of my consent or authorization, which makes their actions unlawful. 
I respectfully demand that you take the necessary steps to delete these accounts from my credit report and send me written confirmation that these items have been removed. This request is made under the rights provided to me by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and related laws. 
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your timely response.

In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i, I request an immediate investigation into the following discrepancies and the removal of any unverifiable or incorrect data. This communication also serves as a pre-arbitration notice in the event that this matter is not resolved in accordance with applicable laws and consumer protections. 
Disputed Information : Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Numbers : XXXX and XXXX Discrepancies Identified : Multiple Entries : The same debt appears multiple times with slight variations in account numbers and details, which is misleading and potentially damaging. Status Inconsistencies : One entry lists the account as "" Open, '' while another indicates it is "" Closed, '' creating confusion about the actual status. Activity Dates : There are conflicting last activity dates between the entries, raising questions about the accuracy of the reported information. Lack of Payment History : The absence of payment history on these accounts does not provide a complete picture and may misrepresent my creditworthiness. Inconsistent Comments : Some entries lack detailed comments, while others include remarks such as "" Account Seriously Past Due Date, '' leading to potential misinterpretation. Legal Basis for Dispute : Under the FCRA, consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in their credit reports. Specifically : Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Mandates that credit reporting agencies must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation if a consumer disputes the accuracy of information. Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) : Requires the deletion or modification of information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable after reinvestigation. Additionally, case law such as Dalton v. Capital Associated Industries , Inc., 257 F.3d 409 ( 4th Cir. 2001 ), underscores the importance of reasonable reinvestigation by credit reporting agencies. Failure to comply with these standards may constitute a violation of the FCRA and open the agency to liability. Supporting Documentation : I have enclosed copies of my credit report highlighting the disputed entries, along with any relevant correspondence and documentation that support my claim. Please review these documents as part of your investigation.

Pre-Arbitration and Litigation Notice : Should this dispute remain unresolved, I reserve the right to pursue remedies under arbitration or litigation. If an arbitration provision is applicable under any agreement between us, I will initiate arbitration proceedings. Be advised that arbitration may incur the following costs, which could become your responsibility in the event of an adverse decision against your agency : Filing Fees : Up to {$200.00}, per the rules of most arbitration forums, unless waived for financial hardship. Administrative Fees : Between {$750.00} and {$1500.00}, depending on the arbitration provider. Arbitrator Fees : Ranging from {$1500.00} to {$3500.00} or more for multi-session arbitrations. If no arbitration provision applies, I will pursue this matter through litigation, seeking all remedies provided under the FCRA, including but not limited to statutory damages, actual damages, punitive damages, and the reimbursement of attorneys fees and legal costs.

Requested Action : I urge you to : Conduct a thorough investigation into the disputed entries. Delete or correct any information that is found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable. Provide me with a written statement detailing the outcome of your investigation. Furnish me with an updated copy of my credit report reflecting any changes made.

Conclusion : Inaccurate information on my credit report can have serious implications for my financial well-being. I trust that you will address this matter with the urgency and diligence it requires, ensuring compliance with the FCRA and safeguarding my rights as a consumer.

Please ensure these fraudulent accounts are removed as required under the law.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with fraud alerts or security freezes,,"Before I Filed my first case on XX/XX/XXXX I had previously disputed these items in which the last one I disputed was XXXX XXXX and it was waypoint and the results came back that they filed everything accurate and updated everything On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with my lender because I'm in the process of buying a house And she told me that the negative items were affecting my credit line and I had to get them off or at least the comments off about previously being in dispute remarks and I believe she said it couldn't say collections. So I called XXXX XXXX they say that they could perform maintenance For me in which the lady removed the remarks about it previously being in collection and she notated that the account was closed So I called My lended back And she said it also couldn't have charged off on it so I called back to see if maybe I could get another maintenance done in which the representative acted like she didn't know what I was talking about so I was explaining to her my laws pertaining to 15USC 1681 and 15 UsC 6802. So now men and lady going back and forth because he's telling me that can't be done I'm telling my report has to be accurate and the information is not information that was even supposed to be reported y'all basically still in my identity and selling my information so these you need to file a police report so she hung up I called back I spoke to someone else he said that he saw the lady had put it up under fraudulent and did I have the proper documents and I asked him what was the proper document he said well see you have four fraudulent things on your account and which I only knew about three so An FTC police report and C F PB Then I called XXXX XXXX back they informed me Three different ways to upload information or send any information which was an email address XXXX They also said that I could mail in the information or I can do a dispute in which I didn't want to do a dispute because of what the lender Hey say previously but they kept saying that they did not receive the documents and there was no other way for them to receive them in a time sensitive matter unless I do the dispute and they will already see it and be able to get the information from that and then close the account in 4 days so me and the lady stayed on the phone for about an hour and a half during the dispute I did all four disputes on XXXX XXXX When When we got off the phone the Lady said although she couldn't pull it up because the message that it raised it said delivery by post mail instead of you results. In which she said this because the file was to be for a computer to read that many human had to read it but she saw that it was in and when they get it they will delete it in 4 days so I called back the next day to make sure that they had saw it because on my end I couldn't click on it because the way it read they informed me they didn't see that I had no open disputes the only disputes I had were in the past and they had already been closed and to submit the documents so they can receive it I would have to do and do a Dispute I informed the lady I already did that with the lady on the phone the other day we went back and forth for a while and I'm asking the lady if I didn't put and she said a dispute in how come when I click on it it says that I can't because I previously have one opened And that one has to be finished before I can submit another one she's like she don't know something wrong with the system They said they could not tell because it was I haven't been more than XXXX hours on the XXXX I got a message saying they deleted the three items I called to ask them why they deleted the items they said it was because of Identity theft So I asked them they blocked the account so that they couldn't report any more they say yes so I called the creditors to see they said they didn't see this it might take some time to reflect but it should be no more than two to three days so I keep calling them back it doesn't reflect although I do see the items moved on my credit report on some other side agencies they said collections or charge off so I called them back to see what it was reported under again they said it was reported under I didn't need them So didn't they send me a letter saying that the identity theft information I sent was in good enough and I would have to submit documents again mind you I didn't see that paper on it today because they keep blocking me out of my account although they was telling me that it was under Identity theft it is not and the information I submitted wasn't good enough because I reported one of the names wrong in which I told the lady he still has the same account number that really did it mean the thing because if one was closed it should still be closed because they was the same account they sequencing for me that I wasn't under identity of or something said that nature because my documents wasn't acceptable in which it say I didn't put my phone number on social security number and other personal information about me in which in all the places I found said not to because they would give the consumers this information and because of that they said it was not grounds to grant identity theif Mind you the lady say that she see how the information is wrong I haven't l but there's nothing she can do about it. They're trying to make it seem like they deleted Items before I found the report in which this is inaccurate were already deleted before I found the reports in the information was already updated so they're not responsible for identity theft they keep locking me out of my account I can not receive my credit score over credit report on Annual reporting unless I opt out I can not speak with someone over the phone unless I opt out I can not send the information unless I opt out At this point they are willifilng disobeying the law after I submitted the proper documents they were still reported fraudulent information and tries to limit what I could do unless I opt out or opt in and which isn't covered by CongressFull Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Date of Birth : XXXX SSN : * -- XXXX XXXX Incident Details XXXX.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a charged-off account that continues to be reported on my credit report, despite qualifying as income under IRS guidelines . The reporting of this account without the issuance of a 1099-C form is both misleading and a violation of my rights under federal law.

Background The account in question was charged off by the creditor, which legally classifies the balance as canceled debt and, therefore, taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) 6050P. According to this provision, creditors are required to issue a 1099-C form for canceled debts exceeding {$600.00}, allowing the debtor to report it as income to the IRS. However, I have not received a 1099-C for this account, yet the creditor continues to report the balance to the credit reporting agencies as an active charge-off.

Legal Basis for Complaint Violation of IRC 6050P : The internal revenue code mandates that creditors report cancelled debt exceeding {$600.00} to the IRS and provide the debtor with a 1099-C form. The failure to Issue this form not only prevents me from property reporting my taxable income But also raises concerns about the creditor 's adherence to federal law Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 16815-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Creditors and furnishers are obligated to report accurate information to credit reporting agencies. Reporting a charged-off account as delinquent without issuing the legally required 1099-C creates an inconsistency between the IRS classification and the creditor 's reporting practices, constituting inaccurate reporting under the FCRA.

Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) 1036 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : It is considered an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice ( UDAAP ) to report a charged-off account as collectible or delinquent when it should be classified as
income and documented through a 1099-C.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",MD,21157,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11241496

The FCRA requires immediate removal of fraudulent information from credit reports following a valid identity theft report, which I have provided. Such inaction is further aggravating the distress caused by this identity theft. There has been no legal proof of the marks has been provided or proven.

This unauthorized reporting has negatively impacted my credit standing. I respectfully request that the FTC, FDIC, & CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that the erroneous and derogatory information is removed from my credit report.

2024-12-22,Prepaid card,General-purpose prepaid card,Trouble using the card,Trouble using the card to spend money in a store or online,"I received a digital American Express pre-paid "" gift '' card around Monday, XX/XX/year>. Since then, I have repeatedly tried to use this card online without any luck. The card is declined everywhere, often with little-or-no detail as to why, so I finally called AmEx to see what the problem was. The agent on the phone did not have incredibly helpful information to share, other than to try attaching it to my apple wallet and use XXXX to fix things, or just "" trying again '' until the transaction went through. 

THIS DID NOT WORK EITHER. 

I have tried using this card on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and the XXXX store. I have tried to buy everything from holiday gifts to groceries without luck. I have tried adding to applepay and to my paypal wallet and it never works. The card is always declined and I am worried this whole thing is some sort of scam at this point. These are major retailers who say the problem is on AmEx 's side. AmEx has been completely unwilling to issue me a refund or even a physical card I could use instead of this useless digital one. Their only "" resolution '' is to "" try again. '' This has to be fraud, right? They get to keep my funds by issuing digital cards they know no vendor will accept despite XXXX claims all over their site and the card 's balance page, such as : "" For online shopping, use at merchants that require the XXXX number, expiration, and security code. '' Ok, I did. It was rejected. Now what? 
and "" Your American Express eGift Card may be used at US merchants that accept American Express Cards. No ATM use. '' Laughably and provenly untrue at this point. I have asked for EXACTLY what merchants are guaranteed to accept this card and have not received anything beyond a vague "" anyone who takes AmEx '' handwave. 

That is false advertising! The first result from XXXX shows that XXXX does, in fact, accept american Express... so why is this digital card being rejected? No one I have spoken with at American Express seems to have an answer other than "" just try again ''. 

This virtual card is declined online and in brick and mortar stores, at restaurants and at grocery stores. Neither XXXX nor XXXX wallets even process transactions with it - no one will take this card. AMEX customer service claims they can not offer me any resolution. They can not tell me where I can use the cards, they can not transfer my balance to a physical card, they can not offer me a refund. 

This system seems designed to skim money from American consumers. They hold our legal tender hostage and tell us there is nothing they can do about it. They falsely advertise that their gift cards can be used anywhere that accepts American Express cards to trick us into believing they're a flexible gift to someone instead of cash. Instead, I have a digital card and my money is inaccessible. 

All I want is the total balance on my card in cash/check at this point so I can cease all dealings with this fraudulent company. 

My card 's number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and there is a balance of {$400.00} on it. Check it! I am so confident no one can use this flippin ' thing anywhere I am putting it in this message.

Part was INDEFINTELY backordered, rendering the vehicle unusable for a sum of five months. Despite Customer inquiring via phone/email ~50+ times for various remedies, deferred payments were presented as the ONLY solution, effectively shifting the financial burden to the Customer for a situation entirely caused by Mercedes-Benz 's. Customer continued to escalate support cases relative to reimbursement of interest accrued on the loan and monthly payments for the period when the vehicle was unusable, due to no fault other than the Manufacturer/Leinholder . 

Subsequent to suffering a total loss in XX/XX/XXXX, Manufacturer/Lienholder ( Mercedes-Benz ) is demanding repayment of these deferred payments, threatening to transfer my loan to an external collection agency unless a payment plan is setup in the amount of {$12000.00}. This demand is unreasonable and unjust, as it disregards the basic expectation of vehicle usability under the financing agreement and warranty. These actions not only harm the Customer financially but also damage their credit standing, compounding the harm caused by Mercedes-Benz 's failure to resolve the situation ethically and promptly Customer escalated a final 'loss of use ' compensation case with the 'Executive Referral Manager ' Team at Mercedes-Benz, to no avail . Manufacturer/Lienholder denied any responsibility and compensation, explaining "" Subsequent to suffering a total loss, Customer is no longer owner of vehicle '', in addition to "" Customer should've asked for compensation sooner '' -- both reasons being grossly unethical and untrue, supported by my documentation.

Note : A myriad of Mercedes-Benz Customer Service Representatives are on record admitting that the Customer should not suffer a financial consequence due to the Manufacturer 's inability to produce a part necessary for driving.

Note : Customer was not supplied a loaner during this five month period and auto insurance rental coverage expired after 30 days, forcing Customer to find transportation out-of-pocket XXXX days.",,Mercedes Benz Financial Services,NJ,08527,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11247700

2024-12-22,Debt collection,Telecommunications debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"I became aware of a XXXX account that is being handled by Amsher Collection Services and is listed on my credit report as a delinquent or past due account with XXXX. I tried contacting XXXX regarding this matter because the only thing that this debt could pertain to is a router for my home internet service which I returned to a XXXX and was issued a receipt for the router approximately 9 months ago. XXXX explained to me that the router was not properly logged in to their main warehouse and for that reason, I was never given credit for the router and that I needed to wait for the router to now be located, logged in at their main warehouse and then the proper credit would be issued to my account. I tried to explain to the agent at XXXX that this is now way beyond that. I told the agent that the account has been placed with a 3rd party collection agency and it is adversely affecting my credit in significant ways. The agent at XXXX referred me to their collection agency Amsher Collection Services at XXXX. 
I called Amsher on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with an agent who did not speak XXXX well enough for me to understand her name. I asked to speak with her supervisor and she declined to transfer me to anyone and said could only take a message. I went ahead and spoke to the very difficult to understand woman who went through a verification process which was really a pre written script in order to obtain my current contact and location information. The agent informed me that her final verification question included me providing her with a valid debit or credit card and allow her to charge {$1.00} to the card in order to prove my identity. At that point I asked the agent to please allow me to speak and to listen carefully and take notes and to stop me at any point if she had any questions. I then explained to the agent that A ) I do not owe the debt that is erroneously listed on my credit report by Amsher Collection Services. B ) I am hereby putting Amsher on notice that I am disputing the validity of the debt and request any and all documentation that Amsher can provide. I told the agent that I have not received a single notice from Amsher regarding their handling of the matter which is required under the FDCPA and that they are in violation of several State and Federal laws pertaining to collection of debts in particular the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( among others ) and that I do not owe this debt and that I have disputed this debt to the original credit granter who also has failed to validate the debt and instead, turned it over to Amsher as an alternative to validating the debt which also is a violation of the Law. The agent then attempted to convince me that I needed to contact the credit bureau itself if I disputed the debt and that the only way I would get relief from Amsher was to pay the debt in full. I again informed the agent that I do not owe the debt and why and that it is not my responsibility to prove that I dont owe it but rather it is XXXX and Amshers responsibility to prove that I do by providing documentation to include a written contract or other pertinent documentation and they have not done that. I have not received a single document from Amsher such as the 30 day notice to dispute the debt or any correspondence at all. The Amsher agent told me to contact the credit bureau if I dispute the debt or whats on my credit report. I informed the agent that me contacting the XXXX credit bureaus is not appropriate at this time and that I have disputed the debt with XXXX and now Amsher and that Amsher is reporting it to the Bureaus not XXXX and not the Bureaus themselves. And that I realize Amsher is only reporting what XXXX tells them to report however, they are responsible and liable for their own reporting and errors and that if I take legal action, it will be against Amsher as they are the Agency that is in violation of the FDCPA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act and again, under the law, I do not have to prove anything. Its not my responsibility under the law to prove I do not owe this debt, it is their responsibility to prove that I do by providing legal documentation in the form of a written contract or other prudent, tangible documents. Not their internal notes or records but something signed by me either in writing or virtual signature and that they have not done that and can not do that because such documentation does not exist. Rather than continue a debate over the law which this collection agent clearly does not understand nor adhere to, I again asked to speak to a supervisor and the agent refused and said would have someone from their legal department call me back. I told the agent to cease and desist all phone calls or other forms of contact unless or until they can provide me with validation of the debt. I also informed the agent I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB, the FTC and the AZ State Attorney General for their unlawful collection practices and for reporting a erroneous debt to my credit report and failing to validate the debt as per the FDCPA. She stated that she understood and would request someone from their legal department call me and could not promise the account would be removed from my credit report or not. After the call ended I sent an email to the corporate office of Amsher requesting validation of the debt and a phone call from the legal department and have not received a single thing from them.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Amsher Collection Services, Inc.",AZ,85022,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11250593

Be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to Sec. 809 ( b ) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act that your claim is disputed and validation is requested.

This is NOT a request for "" verification '' or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.

Please provide me with the following : * The basis of the alleged debt or, in other words, what the money you say I owe is for * An explanation as to how you mathematically calculated what you say I owe * Copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe ; * A certified copy of any judgment if applicable; * The name and address of the original creditor; * Proof that the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account; * Sufficient evidence that you are licensed to collect in my state ; and * Your license numbers and the name and address of your Registered Agent.

Please be advised that if your offices have reported any incorrect information to any of the three major Credit Bureau 's ( XXXX, XXXX or XXXX ), such an action may constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports as a result of your company 's actions, I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ; Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ; and/or Defamation of Character ; If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist.

Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel as to when suit may be filed. This includes the giving of any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is no proof provided that it is.

If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request must be sent to me immediately.

I also am requesting that no telephone contact be made by your offices with my home or my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by the United States Postal Service.

It would be advisable that you assure that your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action. This is an attempt to correct your records, and any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

I have already disputed this debt multiple times with XXXX XXXX XXXX and the original creditor, XXXX XXXX. Both parties are fully aware of my situation. 
Please see the attached documentation from several U.S. law enforcement agencies that support my claim. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX NOTE : As for your awareness, this report will be included in the FTC database, I am requesting an immediate investigation and audit of this bank for violating U.S. Consumer Financial Protection laws. if you have time to address this issue before an audit is conducted, please keep in mind the following consequences under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) for not honoring an electronic identity theft report filed with the FTC by a victim of financial fraud : Civil Penalties : The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) can indeed fine companies that do not comply with consumer financial protection laws in the U.S. The FTC has the authority to impose civil penalties for violations of laws such as the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive business practices. The FTC can impose significant fines on violators, with each violation resulting in fines up to {$51000.00}. Additionally, each day a violation continues can be considered a separate offense, potentially increasing the total fines significantly. Additionally, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) also oversees CRAs and can take similar enforcement actions. Damages : Victims can sue for actual damages, statutory damages, and punitive damages, including compensation for financial losses, statutory damages for willful non-compliance, and punitive damages to punish the violator. Corrective Actions : Credit reporting agencies are required to correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Failure to do so is a violation of the FCRA. Legal Orders : Courts can issue orders to prevent further violations, ensuring compliance with the law. These measures are designed to protect consumers and ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. Furthermore, since I am a California resident, it is important to note that in California, if a creditor sells the debt of a victim of identity theft to a debt collector, it would be a violation of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act under California Civil Code Section 1788.18. This section specifically protects consumers who are victims of identity theft from debt collection actions on debts not rightfully theirs. Essentially, it is considered an unfair debt collection practice to sell a debt stemming from identity theft. The CFPB has already provided you with my updated Identity Theft Report filed with the FTC, along with supporting documents submitted to the local police and an FBI letter to creditors. I have done my part already! I authorize the CFPB to publish this for transparency.",,"Law Office of Michael J.

A recent investigation was done through XXXX XXXX. XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX which came back verified the very same day. Then an another dispute on XX/XX/XXXX, they came back an stated on XX/XX/XXXX that it was verified as correct. I even called them on the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and the rep asked me why I wanted to be disputed and I told him because the account is charged off multiple times which is misleading. I was denied a loan due to this specific account reporting multiple charge offs and when inquired why they state because of a recent charge off. I advised the bank I had asked them to remove due to inaccurate reporting. The account usaa does not show the same on either bureau it is being reported to. This has been over 4 months of disputing this usaa account they even Called me and I explained to them what they were doing wrong verbally and she told me they don't handle how the credit agencies report ... these calls are recorded so I'm sure its on the recording I also have a recording as well. This account needs to be removed from all three reports as it is not correct, reporting inaccurate and more. I disputed this account a requested removal many times I even did a XXXX  report for usaa a more and they are verifying they are reporting accurate a they are not I will attach all proof below. Multiple charge off are misleading and AGAIN I WAS DENIED DUE TO A RECENT CHARGE OFF THAT USAA REPORTED FOR XXXX- it makes it look like a new charge off an its not it charged off in XXXX! not XXXX! 
I will attach the dispute being verified as staying on my report and the letter I stated and pointed out the inaccuracies which I will attach the letter below I sent and also multiple attempts for this account to be remove and there response KNOWING THEY ARE REPORTING INACCURATE INFORMATION. They all have last payment date being wrong as well in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX but account charged off in XXXX... 
Due to my recent denial because of usaa an XXXX Misleading report I am requesting damages and non compliance for ignoring the reporting I pointed out that were incorrect for MONTHS PER FCRA 15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance I gave usaa multiple chances to correct this and allowed them to report incorrect information but I was denied a treated unfairly due to their reporting its misleading! I allowed them to modify and more IT NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. It even went under a REINVESTIGATION and with it still reporting inaccurate it needs to be removed. 
I attached the XXXX XXXX an XXXX on how usaa is reporting, I also attached the information of them confirming the inaccuracies after the reinvestigation, I also attached the two letters that was ignored and called out the inaccuracies they are reporting and nothing was done. Im requesting damages for my unfair treatment. I also attached the showing of NO MULTIPLE CHARGE OFF SHOULD BE REPORTED! I have other proof from XXXX  of there response confirming they are reporting accurate as well. So now that this was reinvestigated and they confirmed it which I attach below need to be removed now that I am supporting all the documents and more.

On XXXX, I contacted the Bank of America Credit Card Application Center to complete a credit card application. Unfortunately, the representatives I interacted with exhibited a lack of professionalism and failed to provide the assistance required to complete my application. Despite following all necessary steps and providing the requested documentation, my application was not processed, and I was left without any explanation or resolution.

This poor service has caused me significant inconvenience and frustration. I expect a financial institution as reputable as Bank of America to ensure its employees are adequately trained and capable of assisting customers in a professional and efficient manner. 

I kindly request your assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that Bank of America addresses these service shortcomings. Customers should not have to face such challenges in managing their financial needs. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing about the resolution.

2024-12-22,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure",I went online to make a payment and it said that I could not submit a payment because I had scheduled one in the past. It showed the monthly amount that was due for XXXX because I am behind but my mortgage is not 90 days past due. I called the mortgage company and the representative said that they could not accept the XXXX month payment and as of now what they saw is that the company was requesting XXXX months payment. When I asked why could they not accept the XXXX month payment because my mortgage is not 90 days behind semicolon I was told because of the investor and the law. I asked her to define that for me and she proceeded to discuss my payments being behind. I said you guys accepted the payment last month on the XXXX and there was no issue. I still never got an answer as to why they would not accept the XXXX month payment even though my mortgage is not 90 days behind. She then proceeded to tell me that she would take information to see what options I had. I was asked questions about my monthly income would I be able to make a payment arrangement or pay the mortgage going forward and I said yes. I was told to call back next week but it could take until next XXXX. I'm concerned because I do not want to go over the 90 day XXXX and be completely 3 months behind. This will cause me to be 90 days behind if I don't make a payment and therefore calls me to possibly go into foreclosure. I also tried to check on the phone to make a payment and it was asking for 2 months payment.,,Onity Group Inc.,VA,23803,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11241622

I open my account and change my direct deposit through my job as I was waiting I didnt even have my card in the mail yet when I received an email saying that there was suspicious activity. They blocked my account until I provided an ID through email. I called first to make sure that this was real and the man on the phone made me send my ID to him and he unblocked my account, although he did not have an explanation as to how there was suspicious activity when there wasnt any transactions or any card even given to me yet. 
My wife sent me money over after I got my card so that I could get lunch one day. As soon as I use the card that day, they closed my account and said that due to suspicious activity, my account was permanently closed could not be reopened with XXXXXXXX XXXX  left inside. I called and had a fit and said that they were just discriminating against me because there was nothing that I did wrong and I told him that they could keep the XXXXXXXX XXXX. That evening I got an email saying that they were very sorry for the inconvenience and the mistake and they opened my account back up. You know the one that they said could not be opened back up again. My wife then sent me money to pay bills which was {$250.00}. As soon as I used XXXX XXXX to pay XXXX of the bills and close my account permanently again however, this time they will not open it back up and there is still {$100.00} left in there. Check in the mail I sent them verification. Needed to get the check in the mail however Im not receiving an answer. 
My first issue with this is the opening and closing of my account is just tampering with my funds. My second issue is the absolute discrimination towards me since I verified myself the first time and there is nothing I did wrong with my account for them to say anything was suspicious at all. They dont do these kinds of things to my wifes account. They just pick and choose who they want to scam. My last issue is my wife personally called and said that she wanted her money returned back to her instead of a check and they said that that wasnt possible. They just took our money when we are already struggling. 

Im not sure why after all of these complaints, Nobody has done anything about this company to protect us. I will do whatever it takes to shut this company down for what they did to us. The way they spoke to us and they are keeping every dollar that we have right now.

So I called Trans Union they say that they could perform maintenance For me in which the lady removed the remarks about it previously being in collection and she notated that the account was closed So I called My lended back And she said it also couldn't have charged off on it so I called back to see if maybe I could get another maintenance done in which the representative acted like she didn't know what I was talking about so I was explaining to her my laws pertaining to 15USC 1681 and 15 UsC 6802. So now men and lady going back and forth because he's telling me that can't be done I'm telling my report has to be accurate and the information is not information that was even supposed to be reported y'all basically still in my identity and selling my information so these you need to file a police report so she hung up I called back I spoke to someone else he said that he saw the lady had put it up under fraudulent and did I have the proper documents and I asked him what was the proper document he said well see you have four fraudulent things on your account and which I only knew about three so An FTC police report and C F PB Then I called Trans Union back they informed me Three different ways to upload information or send any information which was an email address XXXX They also said that I could mail in the information or I can do a dispute in which I didn't want to do a dispute because of what the lender Hey say previously but they kept saying that they did not receive the documents and there was no other way for them to receive them in a time sensitive matter unless I do the dispute and they will already see it and be able to get the information from that and then close the account in 4 days so me and the lady stayed on the phone for about an hour and a half during the dispute I did all four disputes on XX/XX/2024 When When we got off the phone the Lady said although she couldn't pull it up because the message that it raised it said delivery by post mail instead of you results.

2024-12-22,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"On XX/XX/XXXX, American Express National Bank sent me emails confirming that the two IRS direct debit transactions I initiated from my savings account were successful. ( Attachment A ) One payment was for my XXXX income tax balance ( {$60000.00} ), and the second was for my XXXX first quarter estimated tax payment ( {$24000.00} ). ( Note to CFPB : Please redact the payment amounts if publishing this complaint. ) I had already confirmed that my savings account had more than sufficient funds for both payments.

Much to my surprise, on XX/XX/XXXX American Express National Bank froze my savings account due to fraud concerns and rejected both of my tax payments to the IRS. I only became aware of the rejected transactions when the IRS informed me that my account had been frozen. ( Attachments B, C ) Earlier that day, I had received a brief voicemail from the American Express fraud department asking me to call them back ( XXXX XXXX  Eastern ). I called American Express customer service twice on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXXXXXX XXXX Eastern and XXXXXXXX XXXX Eastern, but the fraud department did not pick up my transferred calls even though they were still open until XXXXXXXX XXXX Eastern. The fraud department only answered my call the next day on XX/XX/XXXX. During my call with the fraud department, they were satisfied that no fraud had occurred, and they unfroze my account. I was then able to re-initiate both tax payments to the IRS, and the transactions were successfully processed on the same day. ( Attachments D, E ) I have provided my American Express XX/XX/XXXX account statement showing my beginning balance, all of the transactions I just described, and my ending balance. ( Attachment F ) However, as a result of American Express 's decision to freeze my account and reject the IRS payments from XX/XX/XXXX, the IRS assessed me dishonored payment penalties ( aka "" bad check penalties '' ) of {$1200.00} for the {$60000.00} rejected payment and {$490.00} for the {$24000.00} rejected payment. ( Attachments G, H ) After I submitted a request to remove the penalty due to reasonable cause, the IRS informed me that in order for my bad check penalties to be removed, I must submit a letter from American Express National Bank explaining the circumstances that caused the dishonored payments. ( Attachment I ) Over the past seven months, I have provided many other supporting documents to the IRS in an effort to have the penalties removed for reasonable cause, yet the IRS is still insisting that they need a letter of explanation from American Express. ( Attachment J ) I have also spent countless hours on the phone with the fraud department at American Express trying to obtain such a letter. While the American Express customer service and fraud department employees have been sympathetic, they were unable to provide me with a vetted letter that said my account was frozen due to fraud concerns. They informed me that any custom letter must be generated by the bank 's legal department.

This letter serves as both a formal dispute and a demand for the correction of these inaccuracies. 

Account in Dispute Collection Account : Central Portfolio Control Repeated reporting of the same delinquency months. 
Lack of documentation regarding the first delinquency date. 

Violations of Federal Law Failure to Ensure Accuracy Under the FCRA The FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) and 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ) requires furnishers of credit information to ensure accuracy and completeness. Your repeated reporting of duplicative, inconsistent, and inaccurate details about the account violates these provisions. Consumers are entitled to accurate and fair credit reporting, as emphasized in 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ). 

Invasion of Privacy The Privacy Protection Act ( 15 U.S.C. 68016802 ) mandates financial institutions to safeguard consumers nonpublic personal information. The dissemination of incorrect financial data on my credit report violates these privacy protections and constitutes an unlawful invasion of my privacy. 

Harassment and Unlawful Collection Practices Under the FDCPA As a survivor of XXXX XXXX, your attempts to collect on this debt and inaccurate reporting violate the FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692d ), which prohibits oppressive and abusive practices. Federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1595, provides protections for XXXX XXXX, rendering debts incurred under coercion or duress unenforceable. 

Case Law Support : Doe v. Debt Collector confirms that debts incurred under such circumstances are nullified and unenforceable. 

Demands Cease-and-Desist Communication Under 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ), I demand an immediate cessation of all communications regarding this account. Any further communication must be conducted solely through written correspondence or via the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal. 

Immediate Correction of Reporting Errors Remove all inaccurate entries from my credit report, including duplicative delinquency months, repeated charge-offs, and incorrect balances. Additionally, provide documentation to substantiate the accuracy of the reporting, including : The date of the first delinquency. 
The date of the last payment. 
A detailed payment history. 
Validation of Debt Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, you must cease reporting this account until full validation is provided. Validation must include documentation from the original creditor and evidence of a reasonable and accurate investigation. 

Debt Forgiveness as a XXXX XXXX  Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1595 and federal protections for XXXX  of XXXX, I demand the immediate forgiveness and invalidation of all debts incurred under these circumstances. 

Acknowledgment and Compliance Timeline I require your written acknowledgment of this dispute within 30 days of receipt of this letter. Failure to address these issues appropriately will result in further action, including filing a formal complaint with the CFPB and pursuing arbitration or legal proceedings.

nc. has violated my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, by failing to properly notify me of the debt before reporting it to credit bureaus. Under the FDCPA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ), a debt collector is required to send a written notice within five days of their initial communication with the consumer, providing specific information about the debt. This includes the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor, and a statement that the consumer has the right to dispute the debt within 30 days. Transworld Systems Inc. has failed to provide me with this legally required notice before reporting this debt to the credit bureaus, which is a clear violation of my rights under the FDCPA.

Moreover, under the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, any information reported to credit bureaus must be accurate and substantiated. By failing to notify me of the debt prior to reporting it, Transworld Systems Inc. is reporting inaccurate and potentially misleading information that may harm my creditworthiness. The failure to verify and validate the debt before reporting it constitutes a violation of the FCRA.

This letter also serves as a formal 15-day notice of my intent to take legal action if these issues are not resolved. If Transworld Systems Inc. fails to remove the incorrect reporting from my credit report within the next 15 days, I will initiate a lawsuit under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692k ). I will seek statutory damages, actual damages, and legal fees incurred due to your noncompliance with the law.

Additionally, I will file a formal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General for the state of [ State ], as well as with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). Transworld Systems Inc. 's failure to comply with the FDCPA and FCRA has violated both federal and state consumer protection regulations, and I will pursue all legal avenues to ensure that your company is held accountable.

Please treat this matter with the urgency it requires and take immediate action to remove the erroneous reporting from my credit file. Failure to comply will result in legal consequences, including the filing of the lawsuit and complaints to the Attorney General and other relevant authorities.",,TRANSWORLD SYSTEMS INC,TX,773XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11240287

In the following months I put money into a savings account, a checking account, and a couple investment accounts. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to deposit a check which was a reimbursement from my health insurance company for {$1800.00}. The following day, XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to use my debit card and it was declined. I called XXXX and they informed me my account was restricted. They told me I had violated the user terms, but refused to tell me what I had done which constituted a violation. They said my account was scheduled for closure pending an investigation. They refused to provide more details. They refused to provide a timeline for the investigation and directed me to check the app regularly for more details. On the app, a red banner is displayed above my account details which reads : "" Account restricted "" Your account is currently restricted. Please reach out to us as soon as you can for more information. '' There is an in-app support chat feature called Sofi Virtual Assistant. When I enter this chat, I received the following series of messages : "" We take the safety and security of your account very seriously. In reviewing your SoFi Bank Account, there appears to have been activity which indicates that the account may have been used in violation of the authorized activity guidelines described in XXXX SoFi Bank Deposit Account Agreement.

"" For your protection your account has been temporarily restricted., We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, but during this time you will not be able to deposit or withdraw from the account, transfer funds, m or make purchases with your debit card. 
"" We need to speak with you to discuss your account details. Please call us at : "" XXXX '' Over the course of the next month, I periodically checked the app for updates. Although I continued to receive notifications from the app about my investments, credit score, and monthly spending ( from other accounts ), these notifications I have quoted above remained unchanged. All the person at the phone number said was to check the app, and all the app ever said was to call the phone number. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them again. This was a Sunday ; I have an irregular schedule and didn't think about that until I was already on the phone. Someone did answer though, and whoever it was, was the only person I ever spoke to who sounded earnest in trying to help. They still couldn't provide me with much more information, but they said they would make a note for "" the investigation team '' that I had called. Just before getting off the phone, they asked about a "" beneficiary '', XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is my stage name, under which I have a XXXX account, which had been connected to my SoFi account. I assured the person on the phone that XXXX XXXX was myself, not a third party. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them again, having heard nothing from them in the interim between calls. The person I spoke to chastised me for not calling sooner. They said the investigation team needed the contact information for XXXX ( my health insurance company ) and they have needed that information for months, with an attitude as if I had been purposefully withholding that information. I said that no one had ever contacted me to request that information, nor had anybody mentioned that on the previous XXXX phone calls I had made, but I did provide the information. They refused again to provide a timeline for the investigation. They again directed me to check the app for updates. The app continues to direct me to the phone number. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them again. This time I was told, almost verbatim, the exact same thing I was told on the very first phone call. My account was restricted due to a terms violation and scheduled for closure. I asked if the investigation had concluded, and they said it had. They refused to provide a timeline for closure. They refused to confirm if I would actually get my money when my account was closed. They once again directed me to check the app for updates. 
Today is XX/XX/XXXX. I have heard nothing from them since, and the notifications on the app remain unchanged.

2024-12-22,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On or about XX/XX/year>, I discovered that my Chase debit card was missing. Upon logging into my online account, I was astounded to find numerous unauthorized transactions, comprising multiple large ATM and debit transactions, originating from XX/XX/year>, through XX/XX/year>. To prevent further fraudulent activity, I promptly blocked my Chase debit card through my online account. Subsequently, I contacted Chase customer service to report the loss or theft of my card and also informed them that the PIN number was written on the back of the missing debit card. 
I also confirmed that the most recent authorized transaction was on XX/XX/year>, for gasoline, which declined. Immediately after, Chase notified me via email asking me to confirm if I authorized the transaction. I promptly responded affirmatively, and I was able to retry the transaction successfully around XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/year>. I have included a screenshot of the relevant email for your reference. The unauthorized transactions started to occur the following day on XXXX XXXX. Claim was filed on XX/XX/year> for all XXXX unauthorized transactions. 
Two days after filing my claim, I received multiple letters from Chase on XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX informing me that my claim had been denied but I received provisional credit for only one of the ATM transactions. I contacted Chase claims department on XX/XX/year> to inquire as to why my claim was denied, I was informed it was due to two reasons : the main one being the PIN number being written on the back of the card and the second one is inability of Chase to validate if the transactions were unauthorized. However, I find these reasons untenable, as I did not give my debit card to another individual nor did I authorize any of the disputed transactions. Chase didnt send me any fraud email or text alerts in regard to the disputed transactions. Simply because my PIN number was written on the card does not absolve Chase from the responsibility of reversing these unauthorized transactions. This constitutes a clear violation of my rights as a consumer. I promptly reported these transactions and also took proactive measures, such as blocking my card, to minimize potential losses. 

This is amounts for all XXXX unauthorized transactions that occurred from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX totaling {$12000.00} ; {$500.00}, {$400.00}, {$1900.00}, {$400.00}, {$2400.00}, {$44.00}, {$700.00}, {$1000.00}, {$1900.00}, {$1200.00}, {$500.00}, {$1400.00} I have included screenshots of the transactions and the letters they sent me.

2024-12-22,Debt collection,Telecommunications debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Financial Fraud, Mishandling of Personal Information, and Unauthorized Sale of Data by Portfolio Recovery Associates Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Portfolio Recovery Associates ( PRA ) for the illegal mishandling of my personal information and potential financial fraud. I believe that PRA has committed serious violations of consumer protection laws, including the unauthorized sale of my personal data and debt collection practices that may be unlawful under federal and state law. I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) take immediate action to address these issues and ensure that PRA is held accountable for their actions. 

Summary of Violations : On XXXX, I discovered that Portfolio Recovery Associates had illegally mishandled my personal information and may have sold or transferred it to third-party entities without my explicit consent. This mishandling appears to include, but is not limited to, my Social Security Number ( SSN ), address, and other sensitive financial information. This action constitutes a clear violation of my privacy rights and consumer protection laws.

Moreover, I believe that PRA has engaged in fraudulent activities by either misreporting the status of my debt, failing to provide accurate documentation to validate the debt, or participating in deceptive practices surrounding debt collection. Additionally, the unauthorized sale of my personal and financial information to third parties is an egregious violation of consumer privacy laws and financial regulations. 

Key Violations : Unauthorized Sale and Transfer of Personal Data : The sale or unauthorized transfer of my personal information, including my SSN, address, and financial details, constitutes a breach of privacy under multiple federal and state laws. 
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 U.S.C. 1692-1692p : PRA, as a debt collector, must follow strict guidelines regarding the handling of consumer information. Any unauthorized disclosure or sale of personal data is prohibited under the FDCPA.

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. : The mishandling of my personal information by PRA may have resulted in inaccurate or incomplete information being reported to credit bureaus, violating my rights to accurate credit reporting and privacy.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) 15 U.S.C. 68016809 : The GLBA protects consumers ' personal financial information from unauthorized sharing or selling. The sale of my personal information by PRA is a clear violation of the protections outlined in this act.

Fraudulent Debt Collection Practices : PRA has failed to provide me with valid proof of debt as required by law, and I believe they have misrepresented the debts status in violation of the FDCPA.

FDCPA 1692g : Debt collectors must provide written validation of the debt upon request. PRA has either failed to comply with these requirements or misrepresented the status of my debt.

Misreporting and Inaccurate Credit Reporting : If PRA has incorrectly reported information to the credit bureaus regarding the status of the debt or its collection activities, they may be violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

Penal Codes and Potential Consequences : The illegal sale and mishandling of my personal information by Portfolio Recovery Associates may subject the company to the following penalties : Civil Penalties and Damages under the FDCPA : Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), consumers can recover statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} for violations of the Act, such as illegal debt collection practices, the sale of personal data, or failure to provide debt validation.

Punitive Damages and Compensation under the FCRA : If Portfolio Recovery Associates has misreported my credit or mishandled my personal data, I may be entitled to actual damages for harm to my credit, punitive damages ( if the violation is willful ), and attorneys fees under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

Penalties under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) : If PRAs actions violate GLBA privacy protections, they could face substantial fines and penalties for improperly disclosing consumer information.

State Law Violations : Depending on my state of residence, PRA may also face penalties under state consumer protection laws that prohibit the sale of personal information without consent, including the California Consumer Privacy Act ( CCPA ), which protects against unauthorized sales of consumer data.

Civil Penalties : Some state laws may impose penalties of up to {$2500.00} per violation for selling consumer information without consent.

Requested Action : Given the severity of these violations, I am requesting that the CFPB take the following actions : Investigate the illegal mishandling of my personal data and the unauthorized sale of my financial information by Portfolio Recovery Associates.

Remove any negative marks related to this debt from my credit reports, as this debt was likely mismanaged and mishandled.

Ensure that PRA takes corrective action by deleting my personal information from their records and from any third-party collection agencies or entities to whom it may have been sold.

Enforce appropriate penalties for violations of the FDCPA, FCRA, and GLBA, including statutory damages, punitive damages, and reimbursement for financial harm caused by this misconduct.

Provide me with written confirmation that the debt has been properly validated, all errors have been corrected, and any adverse actions on my credit report have been removed.

Conclusion : I trust that the CFPB will take appropriate action to investigate this matter and hold Portfolio Recovery Associates accountable for its illegal actions. I look forward to a timely resolution of this issue, and I am prepared to pursue all legal remedies available to me if this matter is not addressed.

Thank you for your attention to this complaint. I am confident that your agency will take the necessary steps to protect my rights as a consumer and ensure that Portfolio Recovery Associates is held accountable for their misconduct",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,CA,94509,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11248162

So I called Trans Union they say that they could perform maintenance For me in which the lady removed the remarks about it previously being in collection and she notated that the account was closed So I called My lended back And she said it also couldn't have charged off on it so I called back to see if maybe I could get another maintenance done in which the representative acted like she didn't know what I was talking about so I was explaining to her my laws pertaining to 15USC 1681 and 15 UsC 6802. So now men and lady going back and forth because he's telling me that can't be done I'm telling my report has to be accurate and the information is not information that was even supposed to be reported y'all basically still in my identity and selling my information so these you need to file a police report so she hung up I called back I spoke to someone else he said that he saw the lady had put it up under fraudulent and did I have the proper documents and I asked him what was the proper document he said well see you have four fraudulent things on your account and which I only knew about three so An FTC police report and C F PB Then I called Trans Union back they informed me Three different ways to upload information or send any information which was an email address XXXX They also said that I could mail in the information or I can do a dispute in which I didn't want to do a dispute because of what the lender Hey say previously but they kept saying that they did not receive the documents and there was no other way for them to receive them in a time sensitive matter unless I do the dispute and they will already see it and be able to get the information from that and then close the account in 4 days so me and the lady stayed on the phone for about an hour and a half during the dispute I did all four disputes on XXXX XXXX When When we got off the phone the Lady said although she couldn't pull it up because the message that it raised it said delivery by post mail instead of you results. In which she said this because the file was to be for a computer to read that many human had to read it but she saw that it was in and when they get it they will delete it in 4 days so I called back the next day to make sure that they had saw it because on my end I couldn't click on it because the way it read they informed me they didn't see that I had no open disputes the only disputes I had were in the past and they had already been closed and to submit the documents so they can receive it I would have to do and do a Dispute I informed the lady I already did that with the lady on the phone the other day we went back and forth for a while and I'm asking the lady if I didn't put and she said a dispute in how come when I click on it it says that I can't because I previously have one opened And that one has to be finished before I can submit another one she's like she don't know something wrong with the system They said they could not tell because it was I haven't been more than 24 hours on the XXXX I got a message saying they deleted the three items I called to ask them why they deleted the items they said it was because of Identity theft So I asked them they blocked the account so that they couldn't report any more they say yes so I called the creditors to see they said they didn't see this it might take some time to reflect but it should be no more than two to three days so I keep calling them back it doesn't reflect although I do see the items moved on my credit report on some other side agencies they said collections or charge off so I called them back to see what it was reported under again they said it was reported under I didn't need them So didn't they send me a letter saying that the identity theft information I sent was in good enough and I would have to submit documents again mind you I didn't see that paper on it today because they keep blocking me out of my account although they was telling me that it was under Identity theft it is not and the information I submitted wasn't good enough because I reported one of the names wrong in which I told the lady he still has the same account number that really did it mean the thing because if one was closed it should still be closed because they was the same account they sequencing for me that I wasn't under identity of or something said that nature because my documents wasn't acceptable in which it say I didn't put my phone number on social security number and other personal information about me in which in all the places I found said not to because they would give the consumers this information and because of that they said it was not grounds to grant identity theif Mind you the lady say that she see how the information is wrong I haven't l but there's nothing she can do about it.

After conducting a thorough review of the records pertaining to this account, I have identified the following issues : 1. Transfer of Debt to Chase Issuance Trust : I have clear and indisputable evidence that the debt in question was transferred to the Chase Issuance Trust under filing number XXXX. As such, ownership of this debt was legally transferred to the trust, and there is no record indicating that it was subsequently reassigned or transferred back to you. Therefore, you no longer have the legal standing to collect on this debt. 
2. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The continued reporting of this debt under your name is a direct violation of the FCRA. Reporting inaccurate information to credit reporting agencies undermines the accuracy and integrity of my credit profile, causing unnecessary harm to my financial standing. 
I am formally requesting that you immediately cease all collection activities related to this debt and ensure that all references to this debt are removed from my credit reports with all consumer reporting agencies. Failure to comply with this request may leave me with no choice but to pursue legal action to protect my rights under the FCRA and any other applicable laws. 
Please confirm in writing within 30 days of receiving this letter that : You have ceased all collection activities related to this account. 
All references to this debt have been removed from my credit reports. 
If you believe this matter requires further clarification or documentation, please contact me in writing at the address provided above. I expect your prompt attention to this matter and resolution in accordance with applicable laws.

Two days later my account was also frozen without notice. BMO said they sent a letter but this is unacceptable as freezing a business account isn't something that shouldn't be taken lightly or an owner shouldn't know about immediately. They requested ownership documents linking my name to the business, which I already provided when I opened the account. They informed me they did not have these documents to refer to. I now have to call several vendors and tell them not to cash checks for payment that is due from my company. This damages my business reputation and I am being penalized while doing nothing wrong. The checks are legal and earned legally and written out to my company. I have had transactions related to this business paying vendors for over 4 months with other large transfers into and out of the account. The issuer of the check is a large publically traded company who vetted me and my company as well.

Since you purchased this alleged debt from XXXX, you are subject to the arbitration agreement included in the original XXXX agreement. 

I am well aware that initiating arbitration under this agreement will cost your company thousands of dollars. Additionally, I understand that this alleged debt was likely purchased for pennies on the dollar. Given these circumstances, I am extending you an opportunity to resolve this matter amicably. 

Settlement Offer : I demand a payment of {$XXXX} as compensation for the XXXX, emotional distress, and financial hardship this alleged debt has caused me. 
You must delete this tradeline from all credit reporting agencies and any other parties to whom it has been reported.

Documentation Request : To validate your claim, you must provide the following : 1. The chain of assignment or title of the debt, showing how and when you acquired it.

2. The date of first delinquency.

3. The amount of my last payment and supporting records.

You have 14 days from the receipt of this letter to respond with the requested documentation and confirm whether you accept this settlement offer.

If you add the amount to Escrow shortage it leaves us with a positive balance {$890.00}.

Lakeview Loan Service states we have a shortage of {$710.00} and our mortgage payment will increase {$59.00} each month for 12 months. I disagree with this because they are listing are old insurance policy which was not renewed or paid. I was not aware of the insurance not being renewed until Lakeview Loan notified me then I obtained insurance with a new agent in XXXX for the amount of {$1500.00}. 
The only increase in our mortgage should be the increase in insurance XXXX. - XXXX. = XXXX. 12 months = increase in mortgage {$38.00} which would make ourpayment {$940.00} not the amount they are billing us {$1000.00}.

XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2024 Gateway Financial Solutions XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, MI. XXXX Subject : Notice of Securities Fraud and Violations of 16 CFR 433.1 and Truth in Lending Act Dear Gateway Financial Solutions, I am writing to formally address and notify you of significant legal concerns regarding my account. Specifically, the financing arrangement between myself, Gateway Financial Solutions, and the car dealership XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated applicable laws and regulations, including 16 CFR 433.1 and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ).

1. Violation of 16 CFR 433.1 ( The Holder Rule ) According to 16 CFR 433.1, a car dealership acting as a seller is required to offer a money purchase loan or cash advance rather than a finance loan. The contract provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to comply with this requirement, as no money purchase loan or cash advance was offered or extended to me. This failure constitutes a clear violation of the Holder Rule, which protects consumers from deceptive lending practices.

2. Invalid Contractual Arrangement Under 16 CFR 433.1, a contract is valid only between the seller, the creditor, and the finance company. At no point did I, as the consumer, directly engage in a contractual agreement that properly meets the formal or informal requirements of this regulation. It is unclear how and at what stage I entered into this financial arrangement, as the retail installment sale contract fails to adequately reflect the legal standing of all parties involved.

3. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Violations The contract in question discloses compliance with the Truth in Lending Act. However, the failure to provide me with a money purchase loan or cash advance renders the contract invalid under TILA provisions. The terms of fi
nancing were misrepresented, leading to a lack of transparency and informed consent on my part.

4. Language Fraud in the Retail Installment Sale Contract The contract presented by XXXX XXXX XXXX contains misleading and fraudulent language regarding the nature of the financial arrangement. The terms and conditions fail to clarify the proper legal and financial relationship between the seller, the creditor, and the consumer. Such deceptive language amounts to fraud and violates my rights as a consumer. 

Conclusion and Request for Resolution Based on the above points, I firmly believe that Gateway Financial Solutions and XXXX XXXX XXXX have participated in securities fraud and deceptive lending practices. I request immediate action to address these violations, including a full review and cancellation of the fraudulent contract. 

Please provide a written response within 15 days acknowledging receipt of this notice and outlining the steps you will take to resolve these issues. If no satisfactory resolution is provided, I reserve the right to pursue further legal action and file complaints with relevant regulatory authorities.

As I have revoked my authority previously given to XXXX to possess any of my financial information, I am considering XXXX  threat to delete my financial history in response TO an and an aggravation in explicit violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act which would justify collection of damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. You should ask XXXX and the Pentagon Federal Credit Union what their current authority in Creditor information held by XXXX  is and their authority to possess this information as their agency has been revoked. I do not think they would like to explain this to a federal judge when an injunction is demanded. 

2. I have not had and do not have any relationship with any XXXX  named XXXX An elementary examination of the work page shows this company to be a wholesale like XXXX  which distributes services to business news companies. While I can understand Pentagon Federal Credit Union using the servicesand XXXX  for peculiar reason not knowing this, here are the records that I have received.

7. XXXX XXXX ( I have not heard of this company ) the probable origin on each of these emails would be. 


To XXXX XXXX Transmission by Penfed.com to XXXX In other words, each of the transactions were routine communications by me through XXXX  to make payments. My listed address never changed : the IP address used by Penfed changed. 

XXXX. Of course, if XXXX requires confirmation of this from XXXX does not reflect well on the minimal quality of XXXX, I can have them provide you with this basic information. 

XXXX. As XXXX has more than XXXX ISP connections, and as XXXX  is a national company, I am exceptionally doubtful that either XXXX or XXXX is on any forbidden block list by XXXX. There is no banned XXXX  from my home address, which is blocked, and I have a profoundly serious question as to whether there are any fraud rules which are being violated, other than messages coming from normal XXXX. A competent ( intended use of word ) XXXX  security provider would see that the messages were not coming from my XXXX. You may want to ask them for a copy of their fraud list to include both XXXX and XXXX. If they produce such a fraud list, I will be happy to forward the information to both companies. I have some reason to believe that they will not be able to produce such a fraud list. 

10. My request to restore my XXXX XXXX was caused by PenFeds inability to deal with the now multiple reasons why I do not have XXXX XXXX. I am ready to discuss these reasons both administratively and judicially.

If you end up deleting the records, I will see you in a United States District Courtroom. 

12. I note your statement that XXXX supposedly keeps only a 90-day listing of my transaction history, when in fact they keep a multi-year listing of my payments to XXXX through another part of letter. I do not like word playing. 

13. The attached list shows XXXX approved payment in XXXX when they were supposedly aware of alleged fraudulent conduct in XXXX ( citing from the same letter ), and were denying me access to my XXXX XXXX Account. I will let the Consumer Financial Protection Board resolve this ambiguity. 

Your letter of XXXX XXXX has been most helpful to me, but probably not for the reasons that you anticipate.

Under the Fair Debt collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I have the right to request validation of the debt you say I owe you. I am requesting proof that I am indeed the party you are asking to pay this debt, and there is some contractual obligation that is binding on me to pay this debt.

I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have or continue to report invalidated information to any of the three major credit bureaus XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, this action might constitute fraud under both federal and state laws.

BELOW IS A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL SUBMISSION : I recently placed an item for sale on XXXX XXXX XXXX, a potential buyer contacted me to let me know that she was interested and would be sending a bank guaranteed check via registered mail. When the check for {$XXXX} arrived to cover the purchase price and transportation I deposited the check electronically into my Wells Fargo account on Sunday XXXX XX/XX/year>. While checking my bank account on Tuesday XXXX XXXX I noticed that the check had been cleared which concerned me that it had been cleared so quickly as I had read that checks can take XXXX days to clear. I then phoned the bank ( XXXX approximately XXXX ) to confirm that the check had been fully cleared and approved, I was told that it had, and everything was in order and the funds where available to be used. 

Soon after this call the buyer contacted me to say that her child had been involved in an accident and she needed to cancel the transaction and asked me to return {$XXXX} of the funds. I then transferred {$XXXX} via XXXX into her account in the evening of Tuesday XXXX XXXX. 

On the XXXX XXXX, midday, I was checking my bank details again and I noticed that the check was now showing as pending. I drove directly to my Wells Fargo bank in XXXXXXXX XXXX  to find out what was going on. I was told by Wells Fargo that the check now looked suspicious, hence the revert back to pending status, and at their recommendation I cancelled my old account checking account and created a new one as this now looked like a scam. 

At the bank they created an incident report and contacted the banks fraud department who said that they would get back to me within XXXX to XXXX  days. Due to the lack of response, I phoned Wells Fargo on several occasions to follow up on the status of the {$XXXX} I am out of pocket. I was transferred between the fraud department, customer complaints and the XXXX department XXXX XXXX trying to find out who could help me with this issue. I asked XXXX if they could contact the receiving bank and was told that they had sent a request and that is all they could do. All departments said they could not help me and that I had been scammed. The original deposit was reversed by the fraud department which I totally agree on. On XXXX of the calls, I was put through to a claims dispute department and they said they would follow up. I then received a call from them and they said there was nothing they could do about it. I again told them that Wells Fargo was responsible for allowing me to transfer {$XXXX} from the check and that I would like a copy of the voice recording where Wells Fargo assured me that the check was cleared and there was no problem with it. Again, they said they would get back to me. I received an email Monday, XXXX XXXX stating that I would need a court order to obtain a copy of the recording and if I felt I was a victim of a financial crime I should contact law enforcement. 

By nature, I am a very cautious person, and I would never have transferred the funds if I had not received confirmation directly from the bank that the check had been fully cleared, as such I believe that the bank is accountable and as such should refund the {$XXXX}.

This complaint addresses the improper handling of account receivables by JPMorgan Chase XXXX XXXX ( JPMC ), including its subsidiaries Chase Bank USA, NA ( the Servicer ) and Chase XXXX XXXX ( the Issuer ), with XXXX XXXX XXXX  as Trustee. Specifically, XXXX has failed to address the following issues : Non-Compliance with Fiduciary Duties : Chase Bank USA, NA, as a Servicer under JPMCs operational structure, failed to adhere to fiduciary obligations as outlined in its regulatory filings. Their actions include pooling and securitizing receivables for profit without providing reasonable compensation to the account holder. 

Securitization and Lack of Disclosure : Forensic audit findings confirm that the complainants account was securitized under XXXX XXXX : XXXX and subsequently traded domestically and internationally under XXXX : XXXX. The securitization has generated over {$1.00} XXXX in profits, yet JPMC has failed to disclose these activities or provide compensation for the receivables value. 

Failure to Process Receivables : Submitted International Bills of Exchange were not processed as directed, constituting a further breach of fiduciary duties.

Tax Discrepancies : Audit findings suggest potential violations of tax laws, including failure to file requisite SEC and IRS documentation for revenues derived from trading pooled receivables.

Breach of Consumer Rights : JPMC failed to provide GAAP-compliant accounting, transparency in account securitization, and disclosures required under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), further mismanaging the account. 

Timeline of Events XXXX : The complainants account was securitized under XXXX XXXX : XXXX, pooled for asset-backed collateral, and traded on primary and secondary markets.

To reiterate : XXXX. I vacated the property on XX/XX/year>, under an agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX to move out early due to an armed break-in at my unit in late XX/XX/year>. This release was granted based on police advisement for my safety. XXXX XXXX XXXX explicitly agreed there would be no penalties or fees associated with my early move-out and agreed it was in everyones best interest. Police records can be provided. 
XXXX. I have had no financial or contractual obligations to XXXX XXXX XXXX since my move-out date. I have been residing in a new apartment complex since XX/XX/year>, and fulfilled all terms of my tenancy prior to this release. My final month as a tenant at this address was XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX due to my safety. 
XXXX. The alleged debt is therefore entirely invalid, as I was released from any further obligations under my lease, and no charges were ever communicated to me at the time of my departure. 

Failure to Provide Validation of Debt Your claim that a Lease Agreement and Resident Ledger were provided as validation is misleading and insufficient. These documents fail to explain : How the alleged debt was calculated. 
What charges or fees are included in the balance and why they are owed. 
Why I was never informed of these charges before they were sent to collections. 

This lack of transparency is a violation of my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( validation of debts ) and 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( false or misleading representations ). 

XXXX XXXX to Resolve I request the following information within 14 days of receipt of this letter : XXXX. A complete, itemized breakdown of the alleged charges, including dates, descriptions, and amounts. 
XXXX. Proof that these charges are consistent with the terms of the lease agreement and the early move-out agreement. 
XXXX. Evidence of any communication from XXXX XXXX XXXX informing me of these charges prior to sending the account to collections. 

If this information can not be provided or if the alleged debt is not withdrawn, I will escalate the matter further. My next steps will include : Filing a formal complaint with the state Attorney XXXX office and any applicable housing authorities. 
XXXX with a consumer protection attorney to pursue legal action for damages under the FDCPA and state-specific tenant protections. 
Ensuring that this matter is contested with all major credit reporting agencies to prevent or remove any negative impact on my credit report. 

This is your final opportunity to resolve this matter amicably by providing the requested information and withdrawing the alleged debt.

I contacted XXXX XXXX and the courts, asking them to verify the information they supplied to the credit agencies. XXXX XXXX and the court stated there had been no response from XXXX, Equifax, or XXXX. 

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) requires that each time a consumer reporting agency receives a dispute, it shall reinvestigate free of charge, record the current status of the disputed information or delete the item from the file within 30 days, beginning on the date the dispute was received unless the account is determined to be frivolous or irrelevant.

Based on the previous information, I am hereby demanding the reinvestigated Bankruptcy with the XXXX Courts or delete of the above accounts from my XXXX file pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 5 ) ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ). The FCA law states : Treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information If, after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any information disputed by a consumer, an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer, or modify that item of information, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation. 

XXXX, Equifax ( XXXX XXXX ), or XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) have violated my consumer rights. I am working with XXXX XXXX from the State Attorney 's office to build a case against all three agencies. Based on the evidence I have, the public record should be deleted. 
There is a fact Equifax has been involved in a lawsuit for not following procedures to ensure accurate credit reporting. 

Case # XXXX Inaccurate Credit Reporting Result : 2nd-largest settlement ever under Fair Credit Reporting Act Year : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Information Solutions In XX/XX/XXXX, the Court approved a {$45.00} XXXX settlement on behalf of XXXX claimants against the nations three largest repositories of consumer credit information, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Equifax Information Services XXXX XXXX. Plaintiffs charged that defendants violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by recklessly failing to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accurate reporting of debts discharged in bankruptcy and by refusing to adequately investigate consumer disputes regarding the status of discharged accounts. The {$45.00} XXXX settlement constitutes the second-largest settlement ever in a lawsuit alleging violations of the FCRA. 

During the litigation Credit reporting agencies must now reconcile creditors information against available public bankruptcy records to assure maximum possible accuracy. 

I am writing this letter because I have evidence Equifax has not investigated any dispute letter that I send in or phone.

Please provide me with a contact information, including e-mail address with whom I can stay in contact until this problem resolves instead of opening new complaint. The goal is to resolve this problem and have uncompensated economic stimulus payments paid. I will provide you with some additional attachment that wasn't provided in previous complaint as well as picture of how correspondence with IRS, bank formally known as XXXXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Money Network, Attorney General of Washington State Consumer Protection, Taxpayer Advocated Service in XXXX, CFPB and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency looks since XXXX to present. I will be happy to provide you with any copy upon request. 

I'm contacting you in regards to all unpaid Economic Stimulus Payments that are not paid to me. Originally, I've contacted IRS because the check was supposed to arrive by mail at the end of each tax year. After IRS investigation I was told to contact XXXX XXXX  since they are issuer of the payments. XXXX XXXX  closed and now it is known as XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX  did their investigation and stated that it needs to be provided by current issuer called Money Network. From this point and on there is no connection or response who will pay me the debt. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar what kind of intuition is Money Network ; not much information is provided on the internet. 

I'm requesting all stimulus payments to be paid to me as soon as possible by check and mailed by one day mail immediately. Please let me know what amounts will be paid, for what dates and when. I already provided your company with information that was requested. 

For more than several years I've been in contact with IRS, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Money Network, Attorney General of Washington State Consumer Protection, Taxpayer Advocate Service in XXXX, CFPB Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in order to get all unpaid stimulus payments paid provided to everyone in U.S. without exclusion, but me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an e-mail from XXXX XXXX at Money Network Customer Service giving direction and phone number where I could call to get paid. I've contacted Money Network Financial for four years in order to to get paid unpaid economic stimulus payments. I was promised Impact Stimulus Payments ( EIP ) cards that I never received in mail or in form of a check. The number that was provided to me XXXX does not reach a live service personnel. It loops through pre-recorded options that will not fill the order or allow to leave any voice mail. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a worker named XXXX at the Money Network for the very first time in four years, the questions he asked were personal and invasive in order to just do basic verification to receive unpaid economic stimulus payment debit cards. The questions that he asked sounded like he wanted to run my credit report and criminal record while at it. It sounded more like a scam to me. He would not respond to my questions until I respond to his. Money Network does not respond to written requests. I feel like it's a scam and I no longer know who to contact anymore to get paid. I'm hoping you can help me with this situation as soon as possible.

2024-12-22,Debt collection,Federal student loan debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"Response to Your Letter Dated XX/XX/XXXX Account No. XXXX Dear Customer Resolutions Unit, I am writing to address your response to my client 's CFPB complaint. After thorough review, several issues remain unresolved or inadequately addressed. Below, I reiterate key concerns and provide additional legal grounds for my client 's position.

1. Debt Validation Under FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) Your response failed to fully satisfy the debt validation requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1692g. Specifically, you did not provide : Documentation establishing the chain of title and servicing rights for the debt. 
An itemized breakdown of the balance, including principal, interest, and fees. 
Certified evidence validating the debt as required under federal law. 
As stated in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), a creditor must substantiate their claims adequately when challenged. Your inability to provide this documentation calls into question the legitimacy of the debt. 

2. Protections Against Debt Derived from XXXX XXXX ( 18 U.S.C. 1595 and 1596 ) My client is a victim of XXXX XXXX, which impacts the legitimacy of debts incurred under coercion. Under 18 U.S.C. 1595, victims of XXXX  are entitled to remedies, including voiding coerced financial obligations. Any debt linked to XXXX, coercion, or exploitation is subject to discharge. 

Furthermore, under Title 15 and the FDCPA, continuing collection on such debts violates public policy, as it perpetuates harm against victims. In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX courts acknowledged the financial exploitation of trafficking victims as a critical area warranting intervention. 

3. Discharge Provisions Under the Higher Education Act ( HEA ) You referenced discharge provisions under the HEA but did not provide a comprehensive list or address their application to my client 's circumstances. My client seeks specific clarification on the following : Application of Borrower Defense to Repayment under 34 C.F.R. 685.206.

Eligibility for discharge under circumstances of fraud, coercion, or other violations of law. 
As outlined in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, agencies must act in good faith to address borrower rights under federal student loan programs. 

4. Compliance with Consumer Protection Laws ( FCRA and FDCPA ) Your response did not address compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) regarding accurate reporting and dispute resolution. Additionally, as per the FDCPA, continued reporting or collection activities without adequate validation may constitute unlawful harassment.

5. Processing Delays for IDR Plans and SAVE Applications You acknowledged delays in processing SAVE and IDR plan applications but failed to clarify : How these delays impact accrued interest and eligibility for forgiveness.

Steps taken to mitigate harm to borrowers due to administrative backlogs. 
Delays resulting in harm to borrowers violate due process rights under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX6. UCC 3-60
3 and Tender of Payment You did not address whether the debt could be discharged under UCC 3-603 if tender of payment was made and refused. Please clarify your policies regarding tender and discharge.

Next Steps I request that you provide the following within 14 days : Complete documentation validating the debt under 15 U.S.C. 1692g.

Explanation of discharge provisions under the HEA and their applicability to my clients case. 
Confirmation of compliance with Title 15, Title 18, and all applicable consumer protection laws.

Remediation of any adverse credit reporting or collection activities until full validation and resolution of this matter.

Failure to provide a comprehensive response may result in escalation to the CFPB, legal action, or both. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",,EdFinancial Services,CA,94591,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11247177

2024-12-22,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Synchrony Bank closed my CareCredit account, which had only been open for six months. The reason stated in the letter dated XX/XX/year> from the bank is as follows : "" Activity on account ( s ) with Synchrony Bank indicative of high risk of failure to pay. '' This statement is false. During the short time I had the account, I used it only a couple of times for small amounts and paid off the entire balances before the due date. 

When I called their support line to inquire about the activity they deemed indicative of high risk, their agents stated that the decision was based on my credit information supplied by XXXX. They instructed me to reach out to XXXX for clarification. 

This claim is also false. During this time, my XXXX credit score increased from XXXX to XXXX. I had no new accounts or inquiries. Additionally, XXXX rates all the key indicators with a high impact on my credit score ( i.e., payment history, credit card use, and derogatory marks ) as excellent. All my accounts are in good standing. 

I requested an investigation into this closure because any activity deemed "" risky '' must have been unauthorized, considering my excellent credit history with both the bank and other creditors. 

On XX/XX/year>, I received a letter signed by a Credit Bureau Specialist. The letter stated that, according to their terms, they could close my account at any time and that my payment history may not have necessarily influenced their decision. However, if they are allowed to close accounts without reason, why did they fabricate a false reason, implying that my activities were risky? This is a baseless assertion that they can not substantiate, as all evidence contradicts it. 

The adverse action notice I received was required to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ). Under this law, the bank must disclose an accurate and specific reason for taking adverse action ( pursuant to 12 CFR 1002.9 ( b ) ( 2 ) and 15 U.S.C. 1691 ( d ) ( 3 ) ). The bank failed to provide an accurate and specific reason, violating this law. Providing a false reason constitutes an unfair and deceptive practice, as well as a poor business practice in general. 

I urge the CFPB to investigate this clear instance of legal noncompliance. Please also consider that CareCredit is not just a credit cardit serves as a vital resource for underprivileged and underinsured individuals like me. Closing such accounts without valid justification can leave people without access to necessary medical treatment, potentially causing harm or forcing them into bankruptcy. This unfair, deceptive, and discriminatory practice exacerbates healthcare inequality in this country, putting individuals at risk of not receiving the care they need. 

Additionally, I am a minority as defined under the Fair Housing and Equal Credit Opportunity Acts ( FECOA ). I believe one of the reasons Synchrony Bank closed my account may be due to my protected characteristics.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,CA,94109,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11246105

Despite multiple attempts to resolve this matter with the bank and XXXX, the issue remains unresolved, and I am requesting your assistance in addressing this violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Details of the Issue In XX/XX/year>, I requested the closure of my Bank of America account via a phone call. At the time of my request, the account balance was XXXX. I was assured that the account would be closed. However, due to the bank 's failure to process my closure request, the account remained open, and I was subsequently charged two {$15.00} fees. These fees resulted in late payments being reported to the credit bureaus, unfairly damaging my otherwise exceptional payment history. 

I have disputed these late payments with XXXX, requesting verification of their accuracy. XXXX has responded, claiming the information is accurate. However, the negative remarks on my credit report are the direct result of Bank of Americas failure to process my account closure request as promised, making this reporting unfair and inaccurate. 

Impact These unfairly reported late payments have caused a significant drop in my credit score and tarnished my impeccable credit history. This is unjust, given that the fees and subsequent late payments resulted solely from the banks error in failing to close my account as instructed. 

What I Am Requesting I request the CFPBs assistance to : 1Investigate this matter with Bank of America and XXXX. 
2Require Bank of America to remove the late payment reports from my credit history across all major credit bureaus. 
3Ensure compliance with the FCRA and prevent further harm to my creditworthiness. 

Supporting Documentation I have attached : A summary of my account history, including the timeline of the account closure request. 
Copies of correspondence with XXXX regarding the dispute. 
My XXXX  credit report showing the late payment remarks. 

Conclusion I believe this issue stems from Bank of Americas error and failure to act on my account closure request, making the late payments unjust and inaccurate. I appreciate the CFPBs attention to this matter and look forward to a resolution that restores the accuracy of my credit report. 

Thank you for your assistance.

I believe Ally Bank should also be held liable for similar activity and refund my lost funds. 
Details of My Complaint : Victim of an Online Scam : I have been the victim of an online scam involving the fraudulent purchase of a XXXX XXXX XXXX through the website XXXX The sequence of events leading to this complaint is as follows : XXXX. Transaction Initiation : On or about XX/XX/year>, I entered into a transaction with an individual purporting to be a XXXX named XXXX XXXX, also known as XXXX XXXX. The transaction was confirmed through text messages and emails. The breeder provided contact information including phone number ( XXXX ) XXXX and email XXXX. 
2. Payment Details : The agreed price for the kitten was {$750.00}, with an additional {$70.00} for delivery, totaling {$820.00}. The payment was made via XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, using the email XXXX. The recipient 's name appeared correctly, and XXXX XXXX confirmed receipt of the payment. 
XXXX. Scam Realization : Following the payment, I received a call claiming the kitten was on hold due to an obligatory purchase of an Air-Conditioned Pet Travel Crate costing {$3400.00}. Realizing this was a scam tactic, I attempted to contact XXXX XXXX, who became unreachable. 
XXXX. Report to Ally Bank : I immediately reported the fraud to Ally Bank and requested to stop the {$820.00} XXXX transaction. The bank representative opened an investigation, asked me to file an internet fraud report with the FBI, and report the fraud with XXXX. The Ally dispute number is XXXX. 
XXXX. Lack of Action by Ally Bank : Despite my efforts and uploading all requested documents to Ally Banks messaging portal, the bank did nothing to stop the payment. On XX/XX/year>, I received a letter from Ally Bank, backdated to XX/XX/year>, stating that the transaction was authorized and without error. The letter also noted that the recipient had confirmed the transaction as authorized, which led to the denial of my refund. 
I have reason to believe that the bank representative failed to properly flag this matter as fraud or notify the bank 's fraud department to take necessary action against the scammer. 
Given the recent actions taken by the CFPB against other banks for failing to protect consumers from XXXX payment fraud, I request that the CFPB reevaluate my case against Ally Bank.

2. Failure of Proper Investigation : I disputed the charge with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but they refused to conduct an appropriate investigation of the fraudulent charge, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

I have complied with the requirements for disputing fraudulent activity and expected the creditor to investigate and resolve the issue. Instead, they improperly allowed the fraudulent charge to remain on the account and were negligent in their duties.

I request that ChexSystems conduct a thorough investigation into this matter, as I have not authorized or incurred the fraudulent charge, and I was not involved in any
activity related to this charge. I also request that you update my consumer report to reflect the removal of this incorrect entry as soon as possible, in accordance with federal law. The results of your investigation should also produce a detailed transaction history of the account as well as all of the dispute letters I sent to the credit union.

2024-12-22,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to formally address ongoing and unresolved issues regarding the servicing of my mortgage account in XXXX, Texas. As a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX veteran with a limited income, as documented in the enclosed Veterans Benefits letter, the mishandling of my account has caused undue financial hardship. Below, I detail the key concerns : 1. Unauthorized Escrow Conversion My mortgage account was converted to an escrow account without prior notification. Shellpoint, as the mortgage servicer, failed to provide either written or electronic notice of this significant change, which is a violation of applicable regulations, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), which requires servicers to provide proper notice of any changes affecting a borrowers payments. 

2. Failure to Notify of Delinquent MUD Tax A delinquent Municipal Utility District ( MUD ) tax balance arose due to a communication error. While my property tax bill was sent to my correct mailing address, the MUD tax bill was sent to the rental property address and was not forwarded, leaving me unaware of the delinquency. This oversight resulted in an inaccurate escrow analysis and a dramatic increase in my monthly mortgage payment from {$2100.00} to {$4700.00}. Under Texas Property Code 32.06, servicers are obligated to ensure accurate tax payment management. 

3. Escrow Payment and Denial of Non-Escrow Request On XX/XX/year>, I made a {$7800.00} payment to reconcile the escrow balance based on assurances from Shellpoint representatives that this payment would resolve the issue. However, the elevated mortgage payment remains unchanged. Furthermore, my request to revert to non-escrow status was denied without notification or explanation, violating transparency requirements under RESPA. 

4. Escrow Balance Discrepancy and Communication Issues The most recent escrow analysis reflects an inflated balance, despite Shellpoint receiving both a refund from the MUD utility and my escrow-only payment, along with multiple elevated mortgage payments. The lack of clear communication regarding these matters violates the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), which mandates accurate and transparent disclosures to borrowers.

2024-12-22,Debt collection,Medical debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"I am writing to formally demand that you immediately remove the collection entry from my credit report, which I believe is in violation of my rights under multiple legal statutes, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ).

Firstly, I was never informed by your company about any potential violation of the HIPAA Law in relation to the collection of my debt. Under HIPAA ( 45 CFR 164.502 ), you are prohibited from disclosing any medical information without my explicit consent. It appears that Synerprise Consulting Services has violated this provision by sharing or attempting to collect information regarding my healthcare, which I have not authorized. Your failure to comply with HIPAA regulations, coupled with your improper use of my personal health information, is a clear violation of my rights. 
Additionally, I previously made a payment towards the balance owed, yet I find that my account remains listed as a collection on my credit report. I will not be making any further payments to Synerprise Consulting Services as a result of your failure to comply with the legal requirements set forth under both federal and state laws. This constitutes a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1692 ), particularly under 1692e, which prohibits false or misleading representations regarding a debt. The continued listing of this collection on my credit report is misleading and unsubstantiated by my current payments, and I demand that it be removed immediately.

This letter also serves as a formal 15-day notice of my intent to take further legal action if these issues are not resolved. If Synerprise Consulting Services fails to remove this incorrect collection from my credit report within the next 15 days, I will initiate a lawsuit under 
both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). I will also pursue claims for any damages and legal fees incurred due to your unlawful actions.

Furthermore, I will be filing a formal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General for the state of Texa. Your actions appear to violate both federal and state consumer protection regulations, and I will not hesitate to pursue all available legal avenues to hold your company accountable.

I trust that Synerprise Consulting Services will take immediate action to resolve this matter and comply with all applicable laws. Failure to do so will result in legal consequences, including the aforementioned lawsuit and complaints to the Attorney General and other relevant authorities.

2024-12-22,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Subject : Dispute of Inaccurate Reporting Dept of EdXXXX XXXX Account Ending in XXXX ) Dear Equifax Dispute Department , I am writing to dispute inaccuracies in the reporting of the Dept of Ed/XXXX  account XXXX Account XXXX in XXXX ) on my Equifax credit report. Upon reviewing my report, I identified multiple inconsistencies and errors that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Disputed Inaccuracies 1. Unjustified 90-Day Late Payment ( XXXX ) : The payment history lists a 90-day late payment in XXXX without any progression ( 30- or 60-day late payments ). This is inaccurate and inconsistent with standard reporting practices, and no supporting documentation has been provided to verify this delinquency.

2. Inconsistent Reporting of Balance and Payments : The account reports an increasing balance, yet the scheduled and actual payments for each month are missing or listed as {$0.00}. This is contradictory and does not align with the nature of the account. 
3. Misleading Pays As Agreed Status : While the account is marked as Pays As Agreed, the inclusion of the 90-day late payment in XXXX  is misleading and unjustly harms my creditworthiness. 
4. Omissions in Payment Details : The payment history does not include scheduled or actual payments for multiple years ( XXXX ). This incomplete reporting fails to provide a complete and accurate account overview. 

FCRA Violations 1. FCRA 1681e ( b ) Failure to Ensure Accuracy : Equifax is required to ensure maximum possible accuracy, but the listed discrepancies demonstrate otherwise.

2. FCRA 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) Duty to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation : Previous disputes failed to resolve these inaccuracies, indicating a lack of a thorough reinvestigation.

3. FCRA 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) Obsolete Information : The XXXX late payment, if unverifiable, should no longer be reported or factored into the accounts status.

4. FCRA 1681s-2 ( b ) Furnishers Responsibility to Correct Errors : The furnisher ( Dept of Ed/XXXX ) has failed to ensure the accuracy of the reported data. 

Requested Actions 1. Conduct a Reinvestigation : Verify the accuracy of the 90-day late payment and provide supporting documentation or remove the late payment entirely. 
2. Correct or Delete the Account : Update the balance, payment history, and status to reflect the correct information or remove the account if the information can not be verified.

3. Provide Verification Documentation : Supply all supporting evidence used to verify the late payment and account history.

Supporting Documentation 1. Screenshots of the accounts balance and payment history. 
2. My identification documents : Drivers License Social Security Card Proof of Address Your Responsibility Under FCRA 1681i ( a ), Equifax must resolve this dispute within 30 days. If the inaccuracies can not be verified, the account must be corrected or deleted.

Continued failure to address these issues may result in further action, including filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seeking legal remedies under the FCRA for damages caused by this inaccurate reporting.

To reiterate : XXXX. I vacated the property on XX/XX/year>, under an agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX to move out early due to an armed break-in at my unit in late XX/XX/year>. This release was granted based on police advisement for my safety. XXXX XXXX XXXX explicitly agreed there would be no penalties or fees associated with my early move-out and agreed it was in everyones best interest. Police records can be provided. 
XXXX. I have had no financial or contractual obligations to XXXX XXXX XXXX since my move-out date. I have been residing in a new apartment complex since XX/XX/year>, and fulfilled all terms of my tenancy prior to this release. My final month as a tenant at this address was XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX due to my safety. 
XXXX. The alleged debt is therefore entirely invalid, as I was released from any further obligations under my lease, and no charges were ever communicated to me at the time of my departure. 

Failure to Provide Validation of Debt Your claim that a Lease Agreement and Resident Ledger were provided as validation is misleading and insufficient. These documents fail to explain : How the alleged debt was calculated. 
What charges or fees are included in the balance and why they are owed. 
Why I was never informed of these charges before they were sent to collections. 

This lack of transparency is a violation of my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( validation of debts ) and 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( false or misleading representations ).

Final Opportunity to Resolve I request the following information within 14 days of receipt of this letter : 1. A complete, itemized breakdown of the alleged charges, including dates, descriptions, and amounts.

2. Proof that these charges are consistent with the terms of the lease agreement and the early move-out agreement. 
XXXX. Evidence of any communication from XXXX XXXX XXXX informing me of these charges prior to sending the account to collections. 

If this information can not be provided or if the alleged debt is not withdrawn, I will escalate the matter further. My next steps will include : Filing a formal complaint with the state Attorney XXXX office and any applicable housing authorities. 
XXXX with a consumer protection attorney to pursue legal action for damages under the FDCPA and state-specific tenant protections. 
Ensuring that this matter is contested with all major credit reporting agencies to prevent or remove any negative impact on my credit report. 

This is your final opportunity to resolve this matter amicably by providing the requested information and withdrawing the alleged debt.

2024-12-22,Debt or credit management,Debt settlement,Confusing or misleading advertising or marketing,,"XXXX IS A SAAVY SCAM To be clear, I already see the loophole this organization uses. It is consumer legal group. They have a website and a phone number and it feels very legitimate when you read the actual document that you sign they specify they dont help with credit repair or debt settlement. They are a debt invalidation group. But I have just reached out to an account that I gave them 17 months ago and they have not made contact with them once. I signed up with this company in XXXX of XXXX for an 18 month term, and they have not notified me once about any action they have taken to communicate with any of my creditors. They have said they would negotiate etc, but have never let me know how any conversation went if they took place. They have become strident in conversation over the last couple months to just use the word invalidate not, repair/ settle etc But then, when talking to XXXX XXXX she will say but it is your debt right and we will probably have to do a settlement with your account when they say they dont do settlements or credit repair ..thats when red flag started flying because the actual service they provide has become increasingly unclear except to faithfully debit my checking account. 
I learned standing in court by myself from my creditors attorney that XXXX did reach out once and that was good to know, but thats a pretty crazy place to find out and from opposing counsel! 
I have two court cases going on right now which I was denied an attorney to go with me for, and that is in the agreement that an attorney will be provided if necessary. I felt very foolish standing there, unable to even give the judge an attorneys name. After the fact when I gave XXXX an account of the experience and asked that they still would not provide me an attorneys name. They say they fight to invalidate the debt but pretty much just let it go to court and then try to negotiate a lower amount. That is what they say, but they have not negotiated anything on my behalf and my program with them ends next month. 
The biggest issue is how they got my business by calling me what they said on the phone does not match what was in the agreement. They said 98 % of the clients they work with have their debts resolved at the end of their agreement term and their credit is better than when they started. It actually ended up doing the opposite for me. I will have completed payments with them ( if I continued ) before even going to trial, and my credit is worse than when I started. 
Its misleading its inconsistent and I have confirmed with one of my accounts that they have made ZERO contact in 17 months, so they have just collected a pretty large monthly payment from me for a year and a half, and judging by the one star reviews on the XXXX XXXX XXXX and their website a lot of people have had the same experience, definitely more than the 2 % they claim they cant help. 
I submitted this claim because I saw there was a similar sounding name related to mortgages consumer finance law group that had a settlement XX/XX/XXXX for almost {$12.00} XXXX because they did not deliver services promised to customers. This feels like a very similar situation and deserves a full investigation. They also say you have to resolve whatever you have with them within six months of filing a complaint. Its hard to file a complaint when you have very little information from them. Our communication was basically me calling them and them sending me reminders of when they were going to charge my account. I also continue to forward my financial documents to them that they requested and I would just get an email saying thank you its been uploaded to your account. I have an account Im supposed to be able to view online, but I dont know how to access it. I have requested that information. They provided a username and password when I signed up, but that doesnt work. It doesnt even match the type of prompt its looking for. This entire company is just a misleading way to take advantage of desperate people. I never missed a payment on my credit account until they advised me too, and now I am in a bigger mess than when I started with them. 

I requested they stopped billing me in XXXX because I was very distressed I would not have an attorney going with me to my first court appearance. In XXXX XXXX XXXX said she would process my request but also seemed vague as well, which is a common tactic. 
Im just disappointed, not only did they not invalidate ANY of my debt, not go to court, and not improve my credit, but also happily took almost {$6000.00} of my money to do nothing and run my credit into the ground. I dont think anyone would knowingly pay for that service and probably their five star reviews are people at the beginning or middle of the program who think they are actually being helped.",,"Consumer Legal Group, P.C.",VA,24502,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11239908

However, Equifax advised me that I needed to contact the creditors responsible for these inquiries to obtain a letter from them acknowledging the unauthorized inquiry. 
This is in direct violation of the FCRA. As per the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and complete consumer reports. Equifax, as a consumer reporting agency, bears the responsibility of investigating my dispute and ensuring the accuracy of the information on my credit report. I am not responsible for obtaining any documentation from the creditors involved. By shifting the burden to me and refusing to remove the unauthorized inquiries, Equifax has failed to uphold its legal obligations under the FCRA.
