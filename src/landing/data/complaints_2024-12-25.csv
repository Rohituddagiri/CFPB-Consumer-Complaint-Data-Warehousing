2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Credit monitoring or identity theft protection services,Didn't receive services that were advertised,"Date : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX at XXXX Subject : TransUnion XXXX XXXX XXXX Case Number XXXX - Credit Restoration To : TransUnion XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hello VP of Transunion XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX purchased TransUnion XXXX XXXX years back with 100 % full identity theft restoration services. Yet unfortunately, I've still been hampered by identity theft and stolen event issues on my credit report, which have become significant barriers to moving forward. These identity theft stolen event issues are covered under the identity theft insurance at {$34.00} per month or {$340.00} per year ( plus tax ). Despite this, I find myself grappling with unresolved identity theft issues, compounded by discriminatory practices within the system as identity theft issues have escalated impacting my daily transactions and ability to obtain new credit e.g. my XXXX Bank application was recently declined due to an incomplete credit file. They told me to fix the identity theft issues and reapply later. In addition, an emergency ambulatory medical collection was put on my credit report, after my family was targeted and assaulted after leaving a XXXX ; and the driver was able to avoid jail time ( XXXX ) after violating 18 US Code Section 1389 on an honorable Veterans dependents. Years prior, to the injustices in XXXX XXXX XXXX, a driver tried to hit me with a vehicle off XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA - vehicular manslaughter attempt in broad daylight as I was trying to get my mail- the male driver attempted twice to try and hit me with the grey station wagon and I saw a XXXX XXXX  directing him to do so across XXXX XXXX parked at the Bank. I received a weird chain letter ( attached ) as well a XXXX address fraud letter which I reported to the USPS XXXX XXXX Prior to all of this the identity theft stemmed from when my purse was stolen, at a New York XXXX XXXX XXXX which contributed significantly to identity theft issues. - all of my credit cards, checks, student and military ID, GOES pass, everything was in my purse which was under the passenger side seat of my XXXX XXXX XXXX males got out of a XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, broke into my vehicle and drove off. XXXX was bold enough to use my XXXX card to purchase himself cigarettes and an expensive watch. I reported the GOES pass theft to XXXX. I filed the XXXX. However these actions which should have resolved my identity theft years ago have been ongoing XXXX to present. My family has been severely harmed by terrorism campaigns, vandalism to real estate, my vehicle vandalized. Attacks to my retail transactions and I have filed numerous FTC complaints. Scammers sending me unwanted threatening text messages. I have been sent highly triggering, disturbing racketeering emails to my XXXX which violate Can-Spam ( XXXX have been received just this month ) and I filed numerous FCC complaints which did not help. I have been sent racketeering emails from hotels. Impersonators have used my information at XXXX, a XXXX company called XXXX, I have been sent threatening marketing about death, XXXX, life insurance policies that I never applied for and even someone attempted to get an XXXX XXXX  in my name. I have also dealt with XXXX violations at Veteran Affairs which I reported to the XXXX at VA, XXXX accessing my XXXX  Veteran medical records. Given these circumstances and my ongoing investment in identity theft insurance, I am requesting the removal of the detrimental identity theft harms from my credit report. I believe I over qualify for restoration, and I request for your urgent attention to rectify this situation. It is concerning that, despite my diligence in protecting my identity and my commitment to addressing these issues through formal channels, I continue to face barriers that undermine my financial stability and overall well-being. The negative impacts of these unresolved matters extend beyond mere credit scores ; and request you to consider the gravity of my sensitive and life threatening situation. The compounded effects of identity theft I have faced over the years, demand a serious approach to restoring my identity and integrity. I seek to have these negative harms removed/deleted and request that you share the corrected and completed file with XXXX and TransUnion to ensure that such injustices do not continue to affect my family in the future. 

I demand the immediate deletion of inaccurate and fraudulent information on my credit report and to stop the ongoing, unauthorized charges related to your Restoration Services. Despite providing you with all necessary documentation over the years and clearly identifying the accounts that are both fraudulent and outdated, you have failed to remove these items from my credit report and are continuing to charge me {$34.00} per month ( or {$340.00} per year ) for services that have not been rendered. 

-- -- -- -- The accounts in question should have been removed under federal law : Fraudulent accounts resulting from identity theft occurred when my purse was stolen. The thief used XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX ( BofA ) card to purchase cigarettes and a watch, and XXXX confirmed that the thief was caught on camera at a liquor store. This account should have been deleted from my credit report years ago. I have been back and forth with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) as well regarding stolen identity events and I am done with their toxic, deceptive and discriminatory tactics as well. This situation amounts to XXXX practices and harassment. Additionally, XXXX is fully aware that my vehicle was vandalized in a hate-motivated terrorism campaign. Keeping these accounts on my credit report is intentionally obstructing my ability to obtain loan approval and move away from a toxic situation - stuck since XX/XX/XXXX to present with my dependents. The failure to act has led me to conclude that TransUnion is systematically and intentionally preventing me from moving forward, impeding my ability to improve my financial standing. I believe these actions represent not only an unjust violation of the laws of the land but also potentially politically motivated hate and deceptive practices designed to harm my financial well-being. 

Several discrepancies, including fraudulent accounts and outdated negative items, have harmed my creditworthiness; preventing me from obtaining credit - most recently I was denied credit by XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Despite my previous efforts to bring these issues to your attention, these inaccuracies remain unresolved. The continued presence of these items on my report has directly contributed to a credit denials. This is not only a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), but it has also caused significant harm to my financial well-being. 

I am also requesting the immediate removal of my personal information from all illegal blacklists and fraudulent databases associated with my identity. As a victim of identity theft, my personal data has been misused and included in illegal dark list, hit list, watch list and unauthorized blacklists which have negatively impacting my financial standing and credit, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( XXXX ), which provides for penalties of up to {$25000.00} per violation - I have been violated for years. I am demanding the immediate removal of all inaccurate and fraudulent accounts from my credit report, in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and my rights as a victim of identity theft. Under the FCRA, the penalties include up to {$1000.00} per violation, plus actual damages for any harm caused by the violation, such as denial of credit and emotional distress. Additionally, punitive damages may apply, up to {$500000.00} or 1 % of the companys net worth. Furthermore, accounts older than 7 years, as per the FCRA, should have been deleted but remain. I trust you will act swiftly and in accordance with the law to correct these injustices. I expect the inaccurate items to be deleted from my report immediately. You are taking my money and failing to take any action to resolve these issues. I have been dealing with these discriminatory and deceptive practices for years, and enough is enough.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",CA,XXXXX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-26,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11260175

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I obtained this personal loan in XXXX of XXXX. I did not go through XXXX XXXX 's main website. At the time I used XXXX XXXX to apply for the loan. XXXX XXXX was the one that came up. They approved me for a loan and I paid for the loan, no problem up until now. 
I did what most people do, just pay the loan off as normal, making the minimum payment. Despite XXXX XXXX XXXX  high interest rates and most of the money going to interest, never had an issue paying on time. I kept up my agreement of the loan. Even in XXXX years time, I have paid a significant amount to this loan. 
Fast forward XXXX years later. What I learned, I probably would have never caught if it weren't for the next chain of events. I applied for a home loan with another institution in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX XXXX does not do home loans I believe. They pulled my credit to see where my debts are. The representative of the bank told me everything was good to go. She did not see this error on my credit report. It was only caught by the underwriter. They saw that the XXXX XXXX loan was not updated since XXXX of XXXX. Of course they questioned it and wanted to know what's going on with this loan and what is the actual amount of the loan. The bank for the home loan used a third-party verification company to verify the loan because it was not updated in over a year. The verification company got a hold of someone at XXXX XXXX, who told them over the phone that my loan was paid in full, closed, and in good standing. But when Iogin to the website, it shows a balance that I owe. 
One thing I want to point out is that XXXX XXXX keeps a banner on their page saying it's upgrading their system. This has been on their site ever since I have gotten this loan. So at least two years and counting. The not reporting the credit bureaus is one thing, but telling a third-party verification company that my account is paid in full is a bit suspicious. It would be one thing if I was close to finish paying off the loan and the system needed time to update, but that's not the case for me. 
I have a copy of the verification companies report they gave to the bank because the bank gave it to me and it says what XXXX XXXX told them via them calling XXXX XXXX 's XXXX ( XXXX ) number.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,PA,19608,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11262690

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I obtained this personal loan in XXXX of XXXX. I did not go through Lending Point 's main website. At the time I used XXXX XXXX to apply for the loan. Lending Point was the one that came up. They approved me for a loan and I paid for the loan, no problem up until now.

I did what most people do, just pay the loan off as normal, making the minimum payment. Despite Lending point 's high interest rates and most of the money going to interest, never had an issue paying on time. I kept up my agreement of the loan. Even in XXXX years time, I have paid a significant amount to this loan. 
Fast forward XXXX years later. What I learned, I probably would have never caught if it weren't for the next chain of events. I applied for a home loan with another institution in XXXX of XXXX. Lending Point does not do home loans I believe. They pulled my credit to see where my debts are. The representative of the bank told me everything was good to go. She did not see this error on my credit report. It was only caught by the underwriter. They saw that the Lending Point loan was not updated since XXXX of XXXX. Of course they questioned it and wanted to know what's going on with this loan and what is the actual amount of the loan. The bank for the home loan used a third-party verification company to verify the loan because it was not updated in over a year. The verification company got a hold of someone at Lending Point, who told them over the phone that my loan was paid in full, closed, and in good standing. But when XXXX to the website, it shows a balance that I owe. 
XXXX thing I want to point out is that Lending Point keeps a banner on their page saying it's upgrading their system. This has been on their site ever since I have gotten this loan. So at least XXXX years and counting. The not reporting the credit bureaus is XXXX thing, but telling a third-party verification company that my account is paid in full is a bit suspicious. It would be XXXX thing if I was close to finish paying off the loan and the system needed time to update, but that's not the case for me. 
I have a copy of the verification companies report they gave to the bank because the bank gave it to me and it says what Lending Point told them via them calling Lending Point 's XXXX ( XXXX ) number.",,LendingPoint Holdings LLC,PA,19608,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11262378

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Subject : Dispute and Request for Removal of Fraudulent Charge-Off Accounts from Experian Credit Report Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint and request the immediate removal of fraudulent charge-off accounts from my Experian credit report. As a victim of identity theft, I have been subjected to unauthorized accounts and transactions that have adversely affected my credit standing. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Experian 's policies, these fraudulent entries must be removed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of my credit report. 

The details of the fraudulent accounts are as follows : XXXX. XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$5900.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$5000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$1300.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$1000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : Credit Card XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$16000.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$15000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : Credit Card XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$21000.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$20000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : Credit Card This information is the result of identity theft and does not accurately reflect my credit history. I have also taken steps to have these accounts suppressed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, where they were deemed unverifiable. I have attached a copy of the identity theft report filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), as well as the documentation from XXXX, for your reference. 

Under the FCRA, consumers are entitled to dispute any inaccurate information on their credit reports and to request its removal if proven to be fraudulent. Despite my previous attempts to resolve this matter directly with Experian, these fraudulent charge-off accounts continue to appear on my credit report, causing significant harm to my financial reputation. 

In light of the above, I kindly request the CFPB to intervene and ensure that Experian promptly investigates these disputed accounts and removes them from my credit report. I have attached copies of my identity theft report filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), police reports, and any other relevant documentation to substantiate my claim. 

I trust that the CFPB will take swift and appropriate action to rectify this issue, ensuring that my credit report is accurate and reflects only legitimate transactions.

It has come to my attention that my credit card account, which is in good standing with a perfect payment history, has been deleted from my credit report, effectively shortening my credit history. 

Details of the account are as follows : - **Account Number : ** XXXX - **Account Type : ** Revolving Account Opened XX/XX/XXXX - **Status : ** XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - **Payment History : ** No late payments, paid as agreed I have received multiple letters from all three bureaus requesting additional identification, despite having already provided all necessary information. This continual request for information is unnecessary as I have verified that my records are complete. 

The actions taken by the credit bureaus may constitute a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) regarding willful non-compliance. As my credit report reflects, all three bureaus have acknowledged my account status as "" OK, '' and there are no discrepancies in my payment history. 

I kindly request an immediate investigation into this matter and urge you to ensure that my account is accurately represented in my credit report. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Having previously discussed this with you, I'm writing to request that these accounts be promptly deleted from my report in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which mandates that credit bureaus rectify erroneous information on consumer credit reports. These accounts have caused me stress because they are on my report. It's been difficult to deal with the impact because they don't represent my financial responsibility or credit history. I'm ready to take legal action to protect my rights and find a solution under the FCRA if we can't work this out. The inaccurate items that appear on my credit report have been a big obstacle for me. They're getting in the way of my important financial goals, like buying a house and taking care of my family.

Violation of Notice Requirements Pursuant to Section 623 of the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) and 12 C.F.R. 1022.7, a financial institution must provide notice to the consumer no later than 30 days after furnishing negative information to a credit reporting agency ( CRA ). Specifically : After providing the initial notice, the institution is not required to send additional notices if subsequent negative information is reported about the same account or transaction. 

VyStar Credit Union failed to comply with this requirement. I did not receive proper notice within 30 days of the negative information being furnished to XXXX and XXXX. This failure to follow federal law has resulted in inaccurate and unfair reporting on my consumer credit file. 

Request for Immediate Action I demand that VyStar Credit Union : XXXX. Remove the XXXX late payment for XX/XX/year> from XXXX and XXXX. 
XXXX. Provide evidence that the notice of negative information was sent to me in compliance with 12 C.F.R. 1022.7 and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 7 ). 

Failure to comply with this request will result in further action, including filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and pursuing remedies under the FCRA.

Background : Upon reviewing my credit reports, I noticed several inquiries that I did not authorize. These inquiries have negatively impacted my credit score and financial standing. I have sent dispute letters to the credit bureaus, outlining the specific unauthorized inquiries and requesting their prompt removal. However, my attempts to resolve this issue through phone calls have been unsuccessful, as I was unable to get a representative on the phone.

XXXX. Filed an FTC Identity Theft Report ( Report XXXX : XXXX ) due to the exposure of my personal information in a data leak.

2. Implement measures to prevent further unauthorized access to my credit information.

3. Provide confirmation in writing once the inquiries have been removed.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a resolution that restores the accuracy and integrity of my credit reports.

XXXX XXXX XXXX Formal Demand for Resolution of Fraudulent Loan and Resulting Damages To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally demand resolution of a fraudulent and unethical situation involving the vehicle loan associated with my name, XXXX. The actions taken by XXXX XXXX, as outlined below, have caused me significant financial losses, damage to my credit, and emotional distress. The men who opened this loan knew that because of my age and no prior auto loan history that I was the perfect target to fraudulently obtain and maintain an illegal loan. Summary of Events : XXXX. I made a down payment of {$3000.00} and paid $ XXXX for four months on a vehicle that was fraudulently sold to me. XXXX. I paid a total of {$920.00} in insurance premiums during this period. XXXX.

XXXX. XXXX XXXX  failed to contact me or address the fraudulent activity until I filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). Impact of XXXX XXXX  Actions : Financial Losses : A total of {$6000.00} in payments and expenses. Credit Damage : My credit has been negatively impacted for 20 months, leading to financial strain and potential loan denials. Emotional Distress : This situation caused undue stress, leading to depressive episodes and significant emotional hardship. Demand for Relief : T o resolve this matter and avoid further legal action, I am demanding : 1. Reimbursement of all financial losses totaling {$6000.00}. 2. Compensation for credit damage in the amount of {$10000.00}, or an appropriate amount based on your valuation. 3. Compensation for emotional distress in the amount of {$10000.00}. 4.

Response Deadline : I expect a written response to this letter, including your proposed resolution, no later than XX/XX/XXXX If I do not receive an acceptable response, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter further through legal action, filing complaints with regulatory agencies, or both. Conclusion : This matter is urgent and has caused significant hardship. I trust that XXXX XXXX will act in good faith to resolve it promptly. Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am contacting you regarding a fraudulent auto loan in my name connected to a XXXX XXXX vehicle. After discovering this account on my credit report, I investigated and uncovered significant evidence indicating that this loan was opened fraudulently without my knowledge or consent. Background of the Fraud : On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXX XXXX through a third-party dealership in XXXX, Texas, XXXXperated by XXXX XXXX XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX, the vehicle was unlawfully taken under the pretense of repair and never returned. On XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that XXXX XXXX XXXX reported the loan as charged-off, claiming the vehicle had been repossessed, rebuilt, and resold. This is untrue, as the vehicle was stolen, and I was never notified of any repossession or sale. Action Taken : I have already reported this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and have sent a demand letter requesting resolution & monetary relief. Evidence strongly suggests that fraudulent activity between XXXX XXXX, the dealership, and possibly your company facilitated the creation of this account and illegally ran it as a charge off for 20 months without contacting me. There is no proof of communication to me at this time for which my landlord at this address stated he never received ant letters from XXXX XXXX  Request for Immediate Action : I am requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX 1. Remove the fraudulent account from my credit report immediately. 2. Issue written confirmation that I bear no liability for this loan. 3. Provide any documentation your company has related to the origination and handling of this account. ( For my purposes ) If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate legal action. Evidence of fraud will support my case, including any negligence or willful misconduct by your company in approving this loan without verifying my consent. Please consider this email an urgent notice of dispute under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and respond no later than XX/XX/XXXX. I can be reached at XXXX or XXXX should you require additional information. I look forward to your prompt response. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX All documentation is for your records proving my claim that this is fraud. I am still seeking monetary relief from XXXX XXXX for my financial losses emotional distress and credit damage before I take legal action.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Subject : Identity Theft Dispute Pursuant to FCRA 605B To Whom It May Concern, This letter serves as a formal demand to rectify and suppress all fraudulent and unauthorized information on my credit report, as detailed herein and pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 605B. I demand immediate action to address the aforementioned inaccuracies. Your compliance is expected to prevent further harm and uphold your obligations under federal law.

Pursuant to FCRA 605B, you are legally required to block all fraudulent accounts and remove unauthorized inquiries within 4 days of receiving this dispute and the herein-mentioned documentation. 

As previously referenced, I was a victim of the XXXX data breach, XXXX of the largest breaches in history, which compromised the personal information of millions of individuals, including sensitive data such as Social Security numbers and financial records. This breach most definitely played a critical role in the unauthorized access and misuse of my personal information, resulting in the fraudulent accounts and inquiries outlined below. 

Fraudulent Accounts ( I dispute the following ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX The harm caused by these unrecognized and unauthorized accounts and inquiries has been significant, severely damaging my creditworthiness, financial stability, and mental well-being. These inaccuracies have magnified the financial and emotional toll on my family as we recover from a natural disaster. A strong storm hit our area on a rainy day, causing the roof of our home to rupture and sustain significant damage. As a result, rainwater poured into the house, damaging the structure, our belongings, and essential property. The aforementioned fraudulent accounts and inquiries have further delayed my ability to rebuild stability and provide for my family. 

It is also critical to note that, in my efforts to resolve these inaccuracies, I hired multiple reputable credit repair companies, fully authorized to act on my behalf as permitted by law. Despite this, the credit bureaus employed various cunning and obstructive methods to stall their work, disregarding my lawful authorization and delaying necessary corrections to my credit report. Such actions have magnified the harm caused by the herein-detailed inaccuracies and undermined my rights under the FCRA. 

Failure to address this matter in a timely and lawful manner will result in formal complaints to the 1Attorney General 's office, as well as potential legal action to seek damages for the harm caused.

Enclosed, you will find the following supporting documents for your records and in compliance with your identification requirements : 1. A copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report ( # XXXX ). 


2. A copy of my government-issued ID.

3. Proof of address.

Please direct all correspondence regarding this dispute to my email address at XXXX. I request written confirmation that the requested actions have been completed within 4 days of your receipt of this letter, as required under FCRA 605B. Failure to comply herein constitutes a violation of federal law and will result in escalated legal actions.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am writing in response to CFPB Complaint XXXX. As of this date, the claim status is open on the CFPB site. However, Experian sent a response on XXXX stating all information in the report is correct and their investigation was concluded. This appears to be a rather quick investigation given the complaint was filed on XXXX. I am requesting a reinvestigation as well the source used to verify each line item disputed on the report. 

The following is the contents of the attached letter. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Re : Disputing Accuracy of Credit Report Dear Experian, I am writing to formally request a reinvestigation of the below listed items in my credit report that I previously disputed and believe to be inaccurate. I have reviewed the outcome of your initial investigation, but I believe the information remains incorrect or incomplete. The Dispute Results Report ( Report Number is : XXXX, Investigation ID is : 01 ) you provided by email states the following information was found to be correct after your investigation. However, I am simply astounded by the amount of incorrect information found in this document. 

First, let us identify the glaring item of concern your report includes a Social Security number variation of XXXX. I have never been assigned or requested an alternate social security number from the Social Security Administration. I also have not used an alternate social security number with any business entity. 

Your report includes the following addresses associated with my social security number : Address Address identification number Residence Type XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX My correct and current address is included at the top of this letter . I have not resided at or used any of the addresses included in this report for any business purposes. The fact that some of the addresses are similar but include different variations reinforces the inaccuracy of this report. I am disputing all addresses and request that they be removed from this report. 

Each of the Potentially negative items listed on this credit report contains inaccurate information. I am again disputing the correctness of each item listed below. 

Account name Account number Recent balance Date opened Status XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Please reference the following US Code regarding the handling of disputed information found in this credit report and proper course of action by Experian and each furnisher of this information.

According to 15 U.S. Code 1681e - Compliance procedures, ( b ) Accuracy of report Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

Regarding the treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information, according to 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( 5 ) Treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information ( A ) In general If, after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any information disputed by a consumer, an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall ( i ) promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer, or modify that item of information, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation ; and ( ii ) promptly notify the furnisher of that information that the information has been modified or deleted from the file of the consumer. 

I am requesting an explanation of the reasonable method followed by Experian to verify the accuracy of information and the business entity that verified the correctness for each item listed in this correspondence.

2024-12-25,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"In early to mid XXXX ( approximately ), I ordered a debit card from Fidelity for my cash management account. I was supposed to receive the card which was issued by BNY Mellon in mid to late XXXX. However, I never received the debit card in late XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2024, a {$690.00} debit card purchase was posted on my Fidelity Cash Management account with the card I never received. The purchase was made at a store I had never heard of or have any business with. I also never received a notification of card activation either. I then called Fidelity customer service immediately. Fidelity told me that they would be investigating, and would have updates in the next couple weeks. 

I then contacted my apartment 's management office about my possible missing mails. My management office told me that a mail theft has been caught on camera breaking into the mailroom in the middle of the night, and that they had already reported the crime to USPS and called the police. I later also reported identity theft and mail theft to USPS. 

About 2 weeks later, someone claiming to be investigating the case called me. The investigator asked me how someone could use both my debit card and ID card to make the purchase. I was stunned because as a victim of the crime, I have no knowledge on how it was committed. The investigator then asked me if I had ever been to the shop the purchase was made. I told the investigator I have never been there. The Investigator told me that they might reach out if they needed any more information. 

On the following week, I received a letter from BNY Mellon claiming the purchase was valid, and my fraud claim was denied. The letter was dated on XX/XX/2024, so BNY Mellon denied my claim right after the investigator called me. They never reached out to me again for any evidence or documents. 

I then contacted Fidelity customer service again, and they told me that I had to contact BNY Mellon directly which I did. However, BNY Mellon never picked up my phone call. 

On XX/XX/2024, I went to police department to report the crime since both Fidelity and BNY Mellon were unable to resolve my issues. The police department told me that I would need a statement mailed to me from BNY Mellon to open a case, but again, BNY Mellon never picked up my phone call.",,"BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION, THE",NY,11354,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11262098

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"U.S.C. refers to Title 15 of the United States Code, which deals with commerce and trade. Title 15 includes various laws aimed at regulating business practices, protecting consumers, and promoting fair competition. It covers a broad range of topics such as credit reporting, antitrust laws, and consumer protection. 

Heres an overview of some key parts of 15 U.S.C. : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681 The FCRA regulates how credit reporting agencies ( credit bureaus ) collect, use, and share consumer credit information. It ensures that credit reports are accurate and fair, providing protections for consumers against errors and misuse of their credit data. 

Consumer Rights : Consumers have the right to access their credit reports, dispute errors, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes on their files. 

Credit Report Access : Credit bureaus can only share reports with parties that have a legitimate reason, like lenders or insurers. 


2. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. 

TILA requires lenders to disclose important information about credit terms, such as the annual percentage rate ( APR ), fees, and the total cost of a loan. Its goal is to help consumers make informed decisions when borrowing. 

Disclosure : Lenders must provide clear and accurate information about loans. 

Consumer Protections : TILA aims to prevent deceptive lending practices and ensures that borrowers understand the full costs of credit. 


3. Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1691 The ECOA ensures that all consumers are treated equally in credit transactions. It prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, or national origin. 

Fair Lending : Creditors must evaluate all applicants for credit based on their ability to repay, not personal characteristics like gender or race. 


4. Consumer Credit Protection Act ( CCPA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. 

The CCPA aims to protect consumers in credit transactions, including regulating credit reporting, debt collection, and other consumer finance practices. It is a broader law encompassing several provisions related to credit and lending. 

5. Credit Repair Organizations Act ( CROA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1679 The CROA regulates credit repair businesses to prevent fraud and misleading practices. It outlines the rights of consumers when dealing with credit repair services and prohibits organizations from making false claims. 

Consumer Protections : It requires credit repair companies to provide clear contracts and allows consumers to cancel services within three days. 


Enforcement : The laws under 15 U.S.C. are enforced by various federal agencies, including : Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) : The FTC enforces consumer protection laws related to credit and business practices. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : The CFPB oversees financial institutions and credit bureaus to ensure compliance with these laws. 


Conclusion : 15 U.S.C. is a significant body of law that governs commerce and trade in the U.S., with a strong focus on protecting consumers in areas such as credit reporting, lending, and credit repair. It includes the FCRA, ECOA, and TILA, which are key to ensuring fair treatment, transparency, and privacy for consumers in financial transactions. 

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) refers to a provision in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which regulates credit reporting practices and ensures the accuracy of information reported by credit bureaus. Specifically, 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) requires that credit reporting agencies ( credit bureaus ) take certain actions to ensure the accuracy of the information they report. 

Key Provision : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) This section mandates that : Reasonable Procedures for Accuracy : Credit reporting agencies must "" follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy '' of the information in the credit reports they generate. 

Preventing Inaccurate Reporting : This requires credit bureaus to adopt procedures that help avoid reporting inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete information in consumers ' credit reports. 


What This Means : Accuracy of Credit Reports : Credit bureaus are legally required to ensure that the data they report is accurate and complete, and they must take reasonable steps to verify information before reporting it. 

Consumer Protection : If a consumer identifies inaccurate information on their credit report, the credit bureau is obligated to investigate the dispute.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,""" I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding unauthorized accounts that persist on my credit report despite my repeated efforts to have them removed. These accounts are causing significant damage to my financial reputation and overall well-being. It is evident that the inclusion of these fraudulent items violates 15 USC 1681b regarding permissible purposes, as the credit bureaus have no legitimate reason to report them without my explicit consent. Please refer to the attached file detailing these items I am disputing. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Subject : Dispute and Request for Removal of Fraudulent Charge-Off Accounts from Experian Credit Report Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint and request the immediate removal of fraudulent charge-off accounts from my Experian credit report. As a victim of identity theft, I have been subjected to unauthorized accounts and transactions that have adversely affected my credit standing. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Experian 's policies, these fraudulent entries must be removed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of my credit report. 

The details of the fraudulent accounts are as follows : XXXX. XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$5900.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$5000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : Credit Card XXXX. XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$1300.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$1000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : Credit Card XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$16000.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$15000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$21000.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$20000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : Credit Card This information is the result of identity theft and does not accurately reflect my credit history. I have also taken steps to have these accounts suppressed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, where they were deemed unverifiable. I have attached a copy of the identity theft report filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), as well as the documentation from XXXX, for your reference. 

Under the FCRA, consumers are entitled to dispute any inaccurate information on their credit reports and to request its removal if proven to be fraudulent. Despite my previous attempts to resolve this matter directly with Experian, these fraudulent charge-off accounts continue to appear on my credit report, causing significant harm to my financial reputation. 

In light of the above, I kindly request the CFPB to intervene and ensure that Experian promptly investigates these disputed accounts and removes them from my credit report. I have attached copies of my identity theft report filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), police reports, and any other relevant documentation to substantiate my claim. 

I trust that the CFPB will take swift and appropriate action to rectify this issue, ensuring that my credit report is accurate and reflects only legitimate transactions.

As a victim of identity theft, I have been subjected to unauthorized accounts and transactions that have adversely affected my credit standing. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Experian 's policies, these fraudulent entries must be removed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of my credit report. 

The details of the fraudulent accounts are as follows : XXXX. XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$5900.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$5000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : Credit Card XXXX.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Number : XXXX - Balance : {$21000.00} - Balance Updated : XX/XX/XXXX - Credit Limit : {$20000.00} - Account Status : Closed - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX - Account Type : Credit Card This information is the result of identity theft and does not accurately reflect my credit history. I have also taken steps to have these accounts suppressed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, where they were deemed unverifiable. I have attached a copy of the identity theft report filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), as well as the documentation from XXXX, for your reference. 

Under the FCRA, consumers are entitled to dispute any inaccurate information on their credit reports and to request its removal if proven to be fraudulent. Despite my previous attempts to resolve this matter directly with Experian, these fraudulent charge-off accounts continue to appear on my credit report, causing significant harm to my financial reputation. 

In light of the above, I kindly request the CFPB to intervene and ensure that Experian promptly investigates these disputed accounts and removes them from my credit report. I have attached copies of my identity theft report filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), police reports, and any other relevant documentation to substantiate my claim. 

I trust that the CFPB will take swift and appropriate action to rectify this issue, ensuring that my credit report is accurate and reflects only legitimate transactions.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Subject : Identity Theft Dispute Pursuant to FCRA 605B To Whom It May Concern, This letter serves as a formal demand to rectify and suppress all fraudulent and unauthorized information on my credit report, as detailed herein and pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 605B. I demand immediate action to address the aforementioned inaccuracies. Your compliance is expected to prevent further harm and uphold your obligations under federal law. 

Pursuant to FCRA 605B, you are legally required to block all fraudulent accounts and remove unauthorized inquiries within 4 days of receiving this dispute and the herein-mentioned documentation. 

As previously referenced, I was a victim of the Equifax data breach, one of the largest breaches in history, which compromised the personal information of millions of individuals, including sensitive data such as Social Security numbers and financial records. This breach most definitely played a critical role in the unauthorized access and misuse of my personal information, resulting in the fraudulent accounts and inquiries outlined below. 

Fraudulent Accounts ( I dispute the following ) : XXXX : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$1200.00} XXXX XXXX : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$560.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$0.00} XXXX : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$590.00} XXXX  XXXX XXXX  : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$640.00} Unrelated Unauthorized Inquiries ( I dispute the following ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX The harm caused by these unrecognized and unauthorized accounts and inquiries has been significant, severely damaging my creditworthiness, financial stability, and mental well-being. These inaccuracies have magnified the financial and emotional toll on my family as we recover from a natural disaster. A strong storm hit our area on a rainy day, causing the roof of our home to rupture and sustain significant damage. As a result, rainwater poured into the house, damaging the structure, our belongings, and essential property. The aforementioned fraudulent accounts and inquiries have further delayed my ability to rebuild stability and provide for my family. 

It is also critical to note that, in my efforts to resolve these inaccuracies, I hired multiple reputable credit repair companies, fully authorized to act on my behalf as permitted by law. Despite this, the credit bureaus employed various cunning and obstructive methods to stall their work, disregarding my lawful authorization and delaying necessary corrections to my credit report. Such actions have magnified the harm caused by the herein-detailed inaccuracies and undermined my rights under the FCRA. 

Failure to address this matter in a timely and lawful manner will result in formal complaints to the 1Attorney General 's office, as well as potential legal action to seek damages for the harm caused. 

Enclosed, you will find the following supporting documents for your records and in compliance with your identification requirements : 1. A copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report ( # XXXX ). 


2. A copy of my government-issued ID.

3. Proof of address. 



Please direct all correspondence regarding this dispute to my email address at XXXX. I request written confirmation that the requested actions have been completed within 4 days of your receipt of this letter, as required under FCRA 605B. Failure to comply herein constitutes a violation of federal law and will result in escalated legal actions. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

2024-12-25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"This letter is to formally express my dissatisfaction with the current interest rate ( APR ) on my PNC Credit Card account. The current APR is extremely high, resulting in a minimum monthly payment of approximately {$520.00}, while the interest accrued each month is generally around {$300.00}. 

Given the current economic climate of high inflation and rising costs of living, this minimum payment poses a significant financial hardship. My recent unemployment for six months has further exacerbated this situation.

I have previously contacted PNC Bank regarding this issue and requested a review of my APR or the possibility of a hardship arrangement. Unfortunately, my request was denied without any explanation or alternative solutions offered. 

I believe the current APR on my account is excessive and unsustainable, particularly in light of my recent financial challenges. I kindly request that PNC Bank reconsider my situation and explore potential solutions, such as : A reduction in the APR : This would significantly lower the monthly interest charges and make the minimum payments more manageable. 
A temporary reduction in the minimum payment : This would provide some financial relief during this difficult period. 
A hardship plan : This could involve a temporary modification of payment terms to accommodate my current financial situation. 
I am confident that a mutually beneficial solution can be reached. I have been a loyal PNC Bank customer for over 15 years, and I value my relationship with the bank. I kindly request that you review my account and contact me. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.

My account was charged off or canceled, but I have not received a 1099-C as required by law. The debt in question exceeds {$600.00}, which mandates reporting to the IRS and providing me a copy. The creditors failure to furnish the 1099-C is causing confusion regarding the status of the debt and its tax implications. I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and require the creditor to comply with applicable laws.

The Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) - 12 U.S.C. 5481 et seq. - addresses the harm caused to consumers by unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices, particularly in credit reporting. The CFPA empowers the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to regulate these practices, known as UDAAPs ( Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices ), in consumer financial products.

Capital One 's actions are significantly harming my credit score, which constitutes an unfair or deceptive act.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX. I spent 1 hour and 2 minutes ( at least XXXX minutes on hold ) on the phone with XXXX XXXX trying to get help over a claim they had given me misinformation over and again told them to make sure my insurance was canceled. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I followed up with an email reminding them again to cancel and putting it in writing to be safe, clearly letting them know I was done with their insurance and they did not have permission to charge my bank card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX They confirmed they had received my email. 
On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX again charged my card for {$22.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX over my dissatisfaction with how XXXX XXXX had given me misinformation over a claim and their extended delay in clarifying the issue. 
On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX again charged my card for {$22.00} On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX demanding they stop charging my card and asking that they please refund the charges back until XXXX. The lady found my request in the system to cancel and said that she would see if she could get permission to refund those charges. She said she would call me back the next day and never did. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX again charged my card for {$22.00} On XXXX I followed up with my complaint to the Insurance Board about XXXX XXXX continued to charge my card after I had continually tried to cancel and told them not to. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed XXXX XXXX again demanding they stop charging my card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX again charged my card for {$22.00} On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX emailed me claiming they had tried to call me on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to discuss the cancelation of my insurance. Yet my phone bill shows no such incoming calls to my number on those dates or any other dates from XXXX XXXX Nor a voicemail left. I found it extremely shady that they needed to call me to discuss me being allowed to cancel my business insurance when I am not in any kind of contract to keep their service if I dont want it. 

XXXX tried to force me to sign away my right to sue them for negligence and bad business practice in exchange for refunding the amounts they had been billing me without my consent since XXXX when I had stated that I wanted to cancel my insurance and I had revoked their authorization to bill my card. I replied to XXXX, absolutely not. They were charging my card without my authorization and I was not going to agree to sign away my rights to sue for damage they caused to my business through providing me incorrect information on my coverage for a claim and refusing to return my phone calls for help over over 31 days. 


On XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase asking them for help with these unauthorized charges from XXXX XXXX and disputed them. 

XXXX XXXX then promptly sent out a letter stating my insurance would end on XX/XX/XXXX and fought the chargeback. 

ON XX/XX/XXXX Chase reversed all my disputed charges from XXXX with XXXX XXXX without even requesting any kind of proof that what I have been stating is the truth.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"U.S.C. refers to Title 15 of the United States Code, which deals with commerce and trade. Title 15 includes various laws aimed at regulating business practices, protecting consumers, and promoting fair competition. It covers a broad range of topics such as credit reporting, antitrust laws, and consumer protection. 

Heres an overview of some key parts of 15 U.S.C. : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681 The FCRA regulates how credit reporting agencies ( credit bureaus ) collect, use, and share consumer credit information. It ensures that credit reports are accurate and fair, providing protections for consumers against errors and misuse of their credit data. 

Consumer Rights : Consumers have the right to access their credit reports, dispute errors, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes on their files.

Credit Report Access : Credit bureaus can only share reports with parties that have a legitimate reason, like lenders or insurers. 


2. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. 

TILA requires lenders to disclose important information about credit terms, such as the annual percentage rate ( APR ), fees, and the total cost of a loan. Its goal is to help consumers make informed decisions when borrowing. 

Disclosure : Lenders must provide clear and accurate information about loans. 

Consumer Protections : TILA aims to prevent deceptive lending practices and ensures that borrowers understand the full costs of credit. 


3. Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1691 The ECOA ensures that all consumers are treated equally in credit transactions. It prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, or national origin. 

Fair Lending : Creditors must evaluate all applicants for credit based on their ability to repay, not personal characteristics like gender or race. 


4. Consumer Credit Protection Act ( CCPA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. 

The CCPA aims to protect consumers in credit transactions, including regulating credit reporting, debt collection, and other consumer finance practices. It is a broader law encompassing several provisions related to credit and lending. 

5. Credit Repair Organizations Act ( CROA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1679 The CROA regulates credit repair businesses to prevent fraud and misleading practices. It outlines the rights of consumers when dealing with credit repair services and prohibits organizations from making false claims. 

Consumer Protections : It requires credit repair companies to provide clear contracts and allows consumers to cancel services within three days. 


Enforcement : The laws under 15 U.S.C. are enforced by various federal agencies, including : Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) : The FTC enforces consumer protection laws related to credit and business practices. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : The CFPB oversees financial institutions and credit bureaus to ensure compliance with these laws. 


Conclusion : 15 U.S.C. is a significant body of law that governs commerce and trade in the U.S., with a strong focus on protecting consumers in areas such as credit reporting, lending, and credit repair. It includes the FCRA, ECOA, and TILA, which are key to ensuring fair treatment, transparency, and privacy for consumers in financial transactions. 

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) refers to a provision in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which regulates credit reporting practices and ensures the accuracy of information reported by credit bureaus. Specifically, 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) requires that credit reporting agencies ( credit bureaus ) take certain actions to ensure the accuracy of the information they report.

quires credit bureaus to adopt procedures that help avoid reporting inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete information in consumers ' credit reports. 


What This Means : Accuracy of Credit Reports : Credit bureaus are legally required to ensure that the data they report is accurate and complete, and they must take reasonable steps to verify information before reporting it.

Its reassuring to know that there is a dedicated team ensuring fairness and accuracy in the financial industry. 

I am reaching out regarding an issue I have encountered with my TransUnion credit report. I recently discovered that my date of birth is inaccurately listed as XXXX, making me appear XXXX XXXX XXXX, when in fact, I was born in XXXX and am currently XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

While I understand that TransUnion handles large amounts of data and occasional errors can occur, I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to resolve this issue directly with them. Despite providing documentation that verifies my correct date of birth, they informed me that they are unable to make the necessary correction.

This error, though it may seem minor, has the potential to create significant challenges for me, including difficulties with identity verification, financial applications, and maintaining an accurate credit profile. I value the integrity of my credit report and wish to address this matter promptly. 

I kindly request your assistance in facilitating a resolution with TransUnion. I have attached copies of my government-issued ID and other supporting documents to verify my correct date of birth for your review. 

I deeply respect the role TransUnion plays in providing reliable credit information, and my intention is simply to work collaboratively to correct this discrepancy. I am confident that, with your guidance, this issue can be resolved efficiently. 

Thank you again for the vital work you do to advocate for consumers. I look forward to hearing from you and am happy to provide any additional information if needed.

The tactic used by this party pay by wire to have the package released and anything paid would be reimbursed to me by check. I received an email with check images that I incorrectly thought I could deposit. The check was fake, and it came from a bogus company name and address also held at Wells Fargo. Prior to deposit I checked to see if this was a valid routing and account number ; the system we use for check deposit verified the case. I honestly thought it would clear. 

This party used text message numbers and emails to communicate with me at the end of each day to send more money ; the delay each day was adding to some fees/taxes that prevented anything from being sent.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,""" I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding unauthorized accounts that persist on my credit report despite my repeated efforts to have them removed. These accounts are causing significant damage to my financial reputation and overall well-being. It is evident that the inclusion of these fraudulent items violates 15 USC 1681b regarding permissible purposes, as the credit bureaus have no legitimate reason to report them without my explicit consent. Please refer to the attached file detailing these items I am disputing.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

2024-12-25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Account sold or transferred to another company,"In XX/XX/year>, I had my phone and wallet stolen. And all the other credit card companies followed, normal procedures and reimbursed. The charges that were made by the individuals that stole the credit cards and debit cards. I filed a police report that said my accounts it all been hacked. It was part of a broader crime ring in XXXX XXXX and in fact, XXXX has changed it software since so that you cant change your password without an hour approval. For just that reason so that people couldnt shadow you get your six digit passcode to your XXXX and then get access to all of your accounts Plus since they stole my wallet they went to the US Postal Service and bought things for a dollar and asked for {$1000.00} of cash back during this chaotic 8 hours from XXXX XXXX  to XXXX. They sent an email to my wife who is a joint account owner asking whether this XXXX dollar withdrawal from an ATM was a proper charge and her not knowing and it being early in the morning and me being asleep in XXXX XXXX said yes. So when I went to file the claims with Chase Bank, they ultimately were all rejected under the presumption that I was behaving fraudulently. I subsequently sent them a copy of the police report and an explanation for which I never received a response and within a few months Chase had closed all of my accounts both a credit card thats linked to a United Airlines account and my bank account at Chase. At the time, I decided it didnt matter and I had other cards. 

For background, I have a over XXXX credit score, I have a net worth in access of seven digits, and Ive never missed a payment on any of my credit cards or mortgages or any other lending based account. 

I thought nothing of it until I recently was given an offer to open it Chase United MasterCard via my United app because the points count towards your status on the airline and they accepted and issued me a new credit card and then this month I received a letter, which is dated XX/XX/XXXX saying they were going to close the credit card account. 

I find this anti-competitive behavior from what is largely a monopolistic bank chase, the largest bank in the country that they have the power to turn off your accounts and enclose your credit cards without any explanation whatsoever, and then on top of it that they would issue the card and let you have it for six weeks and then somehow in their back office process to decide that once again you cant own any accounts with Chase Manhattan bank, which is the largest bank in the country without giving me any explanation whatsoever And not responding to my letters. So most of me thinks its their loss but at some point, the Chase company needs to have some responsibility and oversight for their credit behavior when I clearly have sent them evidence that I was robbed that Ive already absorbed {$5000.00} worth of charges because they were the card that allowed the most Set of ridiculous charges including three transactions for {$990.00} as cash back for the US postal system that this behavior is inappropriate given my 25 to 30 history with the bank and my credit score and the fact that I sent them a letter, for which they never responded, that had the police report and it was an actual theft that I wasnt trying to scam them out of the money",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,IL,605XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11262628

These accounts are causing significant damage to my financial reputation and overall well-being. It is evident that the inclusion of these fraudulent items violates 15 USC 1681b regarding permissible purposes, as the credit bureaus have no legitimate reason to report them without my explicit consent. Please refer to the attached file detailing these items I am disputing. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

2024-12-25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Dear CFPB, I am filing a formal complaint against Synchrony Banks XXXX for unauthorized charges and account mismanagement. 

We used XXXX for a XXXX interest-free automated payment plan with our veterinarian to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. All payments were processed automatically through Synchrony Banks system, and we made the final payment on XX/XX/XXXX. After completing the last payment, we discovered an unexplained balance of {$230.00}. 

When we contacted CareCredit, we were informed that this balance was due to a Card Security fee. This fee was neither disclosed during the application process nor explained afterward. We were not informed of its purpose or calculation. The card was used exclusively by the veterinarian, and all payments followed Synchrony Banks automated schedule. We neither authorized nor knowingly agreed to this fee. 

To resolve the issue, I contacted customer service multiple times, engaged in live chats, and was transferred repeatedly between the credit card and "" Card Security '' departments. Despite these efforts, no one provided a clear explanation for the charges. 

I was assured by several representatives that the {$230.00} charge was under review and that no interest or penalties would accrue during the process. Yet, on XX/XX/XXXX, we were charged an additional {$450.00}, with claims that the balance was unpaid. This is absurdwe had set up automatic payments to ensure all balances were paid on time, but this unexplained Card Security fee caused Synchrony Bank to violate the terms of the 6-month interest-free program. 

This reflects serious mismanagement : 1. Lack of transparency : The Card Security fee was never disclosed or explained. 
2. Failure of automated payment handling : The charges contradict the agreed plan. 
3. Conflicting information : Charges were applied despite assurances. 
4. Customer service failure : Multiple representatives failed to resolve the issue. 

I fulfilled my obligations in good faith and trusted their system. I expect a prompt resolution of this issue or will escalate further to protect my consumer rights.

These inquiries are negatively impacting my credit profile and do not meet the FCRAs requirements for accessing a consumers credit report without express authorization. 
Details of Disputed Inquiries : The following inquiries are disputed, as verified by the creditors, who confirmed they were conducted without my knowledge or authorization : Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Creditor Name : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( Repeat for each disputed inquiry ) Legal Basis for Removal : Under the FCRA, specifically Section 604 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ), access to a credit report is only permissible when explicit consumer consent or a clearly permissible purpose exists. The listed inquiries do not meet these legal requirements. Additionally, under Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ), any unverifiable information must be promptly removed from the credit report. 
I have attempted to resolve this matter directly with the credit bureau by submitting a formal dispute letter on [ XX/XX/XXXX ]. However, I have not received an adequate response or the removal of the unauthorized inquiries, which I believe constitutes non-compliance with FCRA provisions. 
Supporting Case Law for Removal : Legal precedents reinforce the need for removal of unauthorized inquiries in the absence of a permissible purpose. In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ), the XXXX XXXX ruled that accessing a credit report without explicit consumer consent or a legitimate purpose constitutes a violation of the FCRA.

Complaint Summary : I am submitting this complaint against Equifax regarding the inaccurate information reported on my credit report, which violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
On [ Date of Credit Report ], I discovered discrepancies in the following account ( s ) : Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Under Section 611 of the FCRA, I have the right to dispute inaccuracies and request prompt investigation. I formally requested a reinvestigation of the account information and cited relevant sections of the FCRA, including : 1. Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Requirement for verification of accounts through original documentation. 
2. Section 611 : Right to dispute inaccuracies and request investigation. 
3. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) : Removal of unverifiable information dont validated for creditor Original. 
4. 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires that the procedures for including information in credit reports ensure maximum possible accuracy Despite my request, Equifax has failed to conduct a thorough investigation or resolve these discrepancies within the required timeframe of 30 days. This negligence has led to the continued reporting of false information, which has negatively impacted my creditworthiness. 
In my request, I emphasized that any unverifiable information should be removed from my credit report INMEDEDIATLY within the mandated 30-day period, as established in 15 U.S. Code 1681i. Additionally, I referenced 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires that the procedures for including information in credit reports ensure maximum possible accuracy. Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, furnishers of information are required to investigate and correct inaccurate information upon notice of a dispute.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"U.S.C. refers to Title 15 of the United States Code, which deals with commerce and trade. Title 15 includes various laws aimed at regulating business practices, protecting consumers, and promoting fair competition. It covers a broad range of topics such as credit reporting, antitrust laws, and consumer protection. 

Heres an overview of some key parts of 15 U.S.C. : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681 The FCRA regulates how credit reporting agencies ( credit bureaus ) collect, use, and share consumer credit information. It ensures that credit reports are accurate and fair, providing protections for consumers against errors and misuse of their credit data. 

Consumer Rights : Consumers have the right to access their credit reports, dispute errors, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes on their files. 

Credit Report Access : Credit bureaus can only share reports with parties that have a legitimate reason, like lenders or insurers. 


2. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. 

TILA requires lenders to disclose important information about credit terms, such as the annual percentage rate ( APR ), fees, and the total cost of a loan. Its goal is to help consumers make informed decisions when borrowing. 

Disclosure : Lenders must provide clear and accurate information about loans. 

Consumer Protections : TILA aims to prevent deceptive lending practices and ensures that borrowers understand the full costs of credit. 


3. Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1691 The ECOA ensures that all consumers are treated equally in credit transactions. It prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, or national origin. 

Fair Lending : Creditors must evaluate all applicants for credit based on their ability to repay, not personal characteristics like gender or race. 


4. Consumer Credit Protection Act ( CCPA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. 

The CCPA aims to protect consumers in credit transactions, including regulating credit reporting, debt collection, and other consumer finance practices. It is a broader law encompassing several provisions related to credit and lending. 

5. Credit Repair Organizations Act ( CROA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1679 The CROA regulates credit repair businesses to prevent fraud and misleading practices. It outlines the rights of consumers when dealing with credit repair services and prohibits organizations from making false claims. 

Consumer Protections : It requires credit repair companies to provide clear contracts and allows consumers to cancel services within three days.

Enforcement : The laws under 15 U.S.C. are enforced by various federal agencies, including : Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) : The FTC enforces consumer protection laws related to credit and business practices. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : The CFPB oversees financial institutions and credit bureaus to ensure compliance with these laws. 


Conclusion : 15 U.S.C. is a significant body of law that governs commerce and trade in the U.S., with a strong focus on protecting consumers in areas such as credit reporting, lending, and credit repair. It includes the FCRA, ECOA, and TILA, which are key to ensuring fair treatment, transparency, and privacy for consumers in financial transactions. 

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) refers to a provision in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which regulates credit reporting practices and ensures the accuracy of information reported by credit bureaus. Specifically, 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) requires that credit reporting agencies ( credit bureaus ) take certain actions to ensure the accuracy of the information they report. 

Key Provision : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) This section mandates that : Reasonable Procedures for Accuracy : Credit reporting agencies must "" follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy '' of the information in the credit reports they generate. 

Preventing Inaccurate Reporting : This requires credit bureaus to adopt procedures that help avoid reporting inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete information in consumers ' credit reports. 


What This Means : Accuracy of Credit Reports : Credit bureaus are legally required to ensure that the data they report is accurate and complete, and they must take reasonable steps to verify information before reporting it. 

Consumer Protection : If a consumer identifies inaccurate information on their credit report, the credit bureau is obligated to investigate the dispute. Under the FCRA, the consumer has the right to challenge incorrect data, and the credit bureau must correct any errors upon verification.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30046,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-25,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11262001

I did not go through XXXX XXXX 's main website. At the time I used XXXX XXXX to apply for the loan. XXXX XXXX was the one that came up. They approved me for a loan and I paid for the loan, no problem up until now. 
I did what most people do, just pay the loan off as normal, making the minimum payment. Despite XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX high interest rates and most of the money going to interest, never had an issue paying on time. I kept up my agreement of the loan. Even in two years time, I have paid a significant amount to this loan. 
Fast forward two years later. What I learned, I probably would have never caught if it weren't for the next chain of events. I applied for a home loan with another institution in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX XXXX does not do home loans I believe. They pulled my credit to see where my debts are. The representative of the bank told me everything was good to go. She did not see this error on my credit report. It was only caught by the underwriter. They saw that the XXXX XXXX loan was not updated since XXXX of XXXX. Of course they questioned it and wanted to know what's going on with this loan and what is the actual amount of the loan. The bank for the home loan used a third-party verification company to verify the loan because it was not updated in over a year. The verification company got a hold of someone at XXXX XXXX, who told them over the phone that my loan was paid in full, closed, and in good standing. But when Iogin to the website, it shows a balance that I owe. 
One thing I want to point out is that XXXX XXXX keeps a banner on their page saying it's upgrading their system. This has been on their site ever since I have gotten this loan. So at least two years and counting. The not reporting the credit bureaus is one thing, but telling a third-party verification company that my account is paid in full is a bit suspicious. It would be one thing if I was close to finish paying off the loan and the system needed time to update, but that's not the case for me.

Specifically, this pertains to the account identified as a {$720.00} charge-off with XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX 
After disputing this account with XXXX, their investigation was completed on XX/XX/year>. Following the investigation, XXXX deleted this account from my credit report, as the information could not be verified. If XXXX has removed the account due to its unverifiability, I urge you to take similar action and remove this account from my credit report promptly. 
Under the FCRA, all credit reporting agencies are required to ensure that the information on consumer reports is accurate, complete, and verifiable. Specifically : Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies conduct a reasonable investigation of disputed information.

If the disputed information can not be verified as accurate, Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) requires the credit
reporting agency to delete it from the consumers credit file.

Furthermore, under Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), furnishers of information must not provide information that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. 
Since XXXX has deemed this account unverifiable and deleted it, I expect the same resolution from your agency. If this unverifiable debt is not removed within 30 days from the receipt of this letter, I reserve the right to pursue further legal action under the FCRA. 
Failure to comply with FCRA requirements may subject your organization to statutory damages, actual damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees under Section 616 and Section 617 of the FCRA. Additionally, if willful noncompliance is found, I may be entitled to punitive damages.

To ensure a clear record of this request, I have attached the relevant documentation, including confirmation from XXXX regarding the deletion of the account. 
Please confirm in writing that this account has been deleted from my credit report or provide a detailed explanation of your investigation findings. I expect a response within the time frame outlined by the FCRA.

Account Details : Creditor : [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ] Account Number : XXXX Type : Auto Loan Status : Charged-Off Summary of the Issue : Equifax has failed to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of my credit report after a reinvestigation was initiated, resulting in the following discrepancies : Conflicting Account Status : The account is marked as "" Open '' while simultaneously showing a "" Charge-Off '' status. 
An account can not be both open and charged off... This account was PREVIOUSLY closed Incorrect Payment History After Charge-Off : The account was "" charged off '' in XX/XX/XXXX. 
However, late payments continue to be reported monthly through XX/XX/XXXX, which is inaccurate as no further payments are due or expected after a charge-off. 

Inaccurate Balance Reporting : The Reported Balance is {$5100.00}, while the Highest Balance is incorrectly shown as {$0.00}. 
These inconsistencies reflect improper reporting practices... The previous bal reported was XXXX Failure to Properly Reinvestigate the Dispute : Despite marking the account with the remark "" Consumer Disputes- Reinvestigation in Progress, '' Equifax has introduced new reporting errors instead of correcting the previously disputed ones. 

This is FRUSTRATING and currently hurting my score and reliability with other creditors : Why mark the account "" Reinvestigation in process '' but updated the account information that does not match the account status and payments?!? 
Equifax is not doing their due diligence and is STALLING. 

Equifax are violating the FCRA 1681e ( b ) : Failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy in reporting consumer information.

FCRA 1681i ( a ) : Failure to conduct a proper reinvestigation of disputed information.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Subject : Formal Dispute and Demand for Permanent Removal of Fraudulent Account To Whom It May Concern, I am formally disputing the accuracy and legitimacy of the account listed under XXXX XXXX XXXX which is reflected as a charge-off on my credit report. This account is entirely fraudulent, as I have previously provided comprehensive documentation proving that : 1. The vehicle was never repossessed, as falsely claimed. 
2. The vehicle was stolen and involved in fraudulent activity by third parties associated with the dealership, which has been documented and reported. 
3. I was never informed of any repossession, rebuild, or resale of the vehicle. 

Given the overwhelming evidence, XXXX XXXX XXXX is knowingly perpetuating this fraudulent charge-off by allowing it to remain on my credit report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) guidelines, it is illegal to report false or inaccurate information on a consumers credit file. 

I demand the immediate and permanent removal of this account from my credit report. Failure to do so will leave me no choice but to escalate this matter by filing a formal complaint with the CFPB and pursuing legal action to protect my consumer rights. 

I expect written confirmation of this accounts removal within 15 days of this notice.

Supporting Documentation : I have enclosed the following documents to substantiate my claim : 1. A copy of the police report documenting the fraud and theft. 
2. A copy of the Court Case Number XXXX. Any additional correspondence with XXXX XXXX regarding the dispute. 
I kindly request that your agency investigate this matter promptly and remove this incorrect information from my credit report in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
Please notify me of the results of your investigation in writing.

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violation : If the bank reported the fraudulent loan to credit bureaus and failed to correct the information after you disputed it, they may have violated the FCRA. This law requires creditors to ensure the accuracy of information they report and investigate disputes promptly.

3. Identity Theft Laws Violation : If the bank was negligent in protecting your personal information or failed to implement sufficient safeguards to prevent identity theft, they could be held accountable under federal or state identity theft laws. 
4. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) Violation : This law requires financial institutions to protect consumer data. If the bank mishandled your personal information and that led to the fraudulent loan, they may have violated the GLBAs privacy and safeguard provisions. 
5. Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) Violation : If the fraudulent account was used to deny you credit or financial opportunities and the bank failed to properly investigate or take corrective action, they could be in violation of the ECOA. 
6. Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) - Fraudulent Endorsement or Contracts Violation : Under the UCC, financial institutions have a duty to ensure contracts, such as auto loans, are legitimate. If the bank failed to verify the authenticity of the signatures or loan details, they could be held liable. 
7. State Consumer Protection Laws Violation : Most states have consumer protection laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive business practices. If the bank acted negligently or failed to respond appropriately to your claims, they may have violated these laws. 
Possible Bank-Specific Misconduct If the bank failed to investigate adequately, ignored evidence of fraud, or continued collection efforts after you reported the fraudulent loan, they may also have engaged in : Negligence : Failing to take reasonable steps to prevent or address the fraud. 
Bad Faith : Acting in a way that is contrary to fair dealing and honest practices. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Formal Demand for Resolution of Fraudulent Loan and Resulting Damages To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally demand resolution of a fraudulent and unethical situation involving the vehicle loan associated with my name, XXXX. The actions taken by XXXX XXXX, as outlined below, have caused me significant financial losses, damage to my credit, and emotional distress. The men who opened this loan knew that because of my age and no prior auto loan history that I was the perfect target to fraudulently obtain and maintain an illegal loan. 
Summary of Events : 1. I made a down payment of {$3000.00} and paid $ XXXXmonth for four months on a vehicle that was fraudulently sold to me. 
2. I paid a total of {$920.00} in insurance premiums during this period. 
3. The vehicle was illegally repossessed by the dealership and sold at auction for {$4100.00}, yet XXXX XXXX reported this as a charge-off on my credit report, causing substantial harm for 20 months. 
4. XXXX XXXX  failed to contact me or address the fraudulent activity until I filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). 
Impact of XXXX XXXX Actions : Financial Losses : A total of {$6000.00} in payments and expenses. 
Credit Damage : My credit has been negatively impacted for 20 months, leading to financial strain and potential loan denials. 
Emotional Distress : This situation caused undue stress, leading to depressive episodes and significant emotional hardship. 
Demand for Relief : T o resolve this matter and avoid further legal action, I am demanding : 1. Reimbursement of all financial losses totaling {$6000.00}. 
2. Compensation for credit damage in the amount of {$10000.00}, or an appropriate amount based on your valuation. 
3. Compensation for emotional distress in the amount of {$10000.00}. 
4. Removal of the fraudulent loan and charge-off from my credit report. 
All consideration is respected however this matter should be taken seriously before I move forward legally. 
Response Deadline : I expect a written response to this letter, including your proposed resolution, no later than XX/XX/XXXX If I do not receive an acceptable response, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter further through legal action, filing complaints with regulatory agencies, or both. 
Conclusion : This matter is urgent and has caused significant hardship. I trust that XXXX XXXX will act in good faith to resolve it promptly. 
Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am contacting you regarding a fraudulent auto loan in my name connected to a XXXX XXXX vehicle. After discovering this account on my credit report, I investigated and uncovered significant evidence indicating that this loan was opened fraudulently without my knowledge or consent. 
Background of the Fraud : On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXX XXXX through a third-party dealership in XXXX, Texas, operated by XXXX XXXX . 
In XX/XX/XXXX, the vehicle was unlawfully taken under the pretense of repair and never returned. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that XXXX XXXX XXXX reported the loan as charged-off, claiming the vehicle had been repossessed, rebuilt, and resold. This is untrue, as the vehicle was stolen, and I was never notified of any repossession or sale. 
Action Taken : I have already reported this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and have sent a demand letter requesting resolution & monetary relief. Evidence strongly suggests that fraudulent activity between XXXX XXXX, the dealership, and possibly your company facilitated the creation of this account and illegally ran it as a charge off for 20 months without contacting me. There is no proof of communication to me at this time for which my landlord at this address stated he never received ant letters from XXXX XXXX. 
Request for Immediate Action : I am requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX 1. Remove the fraudulent account from my credit report immediately. 
2. Issue written confirmation that I bear no liability for this loan. 
3. Provide any documentation your company has related to the origination and handling of this account. ( For my purposes ) If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate legal action. Evidence of fraud will support my case, including any negligence or willful misconduct by your company in approving this loan without verifying my consent. 
Please consider this email an urgent notice of dispute under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and respond no later than XX/XX/XXXX. I can be reached at XXXX or XXXX should you require additional information. 
I look forward to your prompt response. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX All documentation is for your records proving my claim that this is fraud. I am still seeking monetary relief from XXXX XXXX for my financial losses emotional distress and credit damage before I take legal action. I will be forwarding this email to a lawyer of mine who has been informed of illegal activities at hand.

Equifax has refused to properly investigate or remove fraudulent accounts reported to FTC Identify Theft on my credit file, causing significant harm and violating my rights. 

Background : On XX/XX/XXXX, Equifax informed me that XXXX of the fraudulent accounts I reported on XX/XX/XXXX to the FTC Identity Theft as fraud accounts were "" verified '' per the debt collector, despite being flagged as fraudulent. This response came after 32 days of delay, resulting in an inconclusive decision and allowing the fraudulent accounts to remain on my credit report. 

CRAs Failure to Comply : Despite my clear and lawful dispute, Equifax either failed to perform an adequate investigation or improperly verified the accounts with the original creditors/debtors without validating their legitimacy. This constitutes a violation of my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), which requires Equifax to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information and delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable items. 

Harm Caused : The continued reporting of these fraudulent accounts is negatively impacting my credit score and financial well-being. Additionally, I have spent considerable time and resources attempting to correct this issue, only to encounter further delays and noncompliance by Equifax. 

Laws Violated : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : Equifax failed to meet its obligation to reasonably investigate my dispute under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ). Equifax continued to report unverifiable and fraudulent information, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which mandates accurate reporting. Equifax willful noncompliance with its obligations constitutes a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681n, which provides for civil liability for willful violations, including damages, attorneys fees, and punitive damages.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ) : Equifax improperly relied on a creditor or debt collectors unverified claims without ensuring the accuracy of the account, potentially facilitating abusive debt collection practices. This constitutes a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692k, which provides for civil liability for violations, including actual damages, statutory damages, and attorneys fees.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,32713,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-25,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11260407

These accounts are causing significant damage to my financial reputation and overall well-being. It is evident that the inclusion of these fraudulent items violates 15 USC 1681b regarding permissible purposes, as the credit bureaus have no legitimate reason to report them without my explicit consent. Please refer to the attached file detailing these items I am disputing. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

Background : Upon reviewing my credit reports, I noticed several inquiries that I did not authorize. These inquiries have negatively impacted my credit score and financial standing. I have sent dispute letters to the credit bureaus, outlining the specific unauthorized inquiries and requesting their prompt removal. However, my attempts to resolve this issue through phone calls have been unsuccessful, as I was unable to get a representative on the phone.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Subject : Formal Complaint and Demand for Compensation for FCRA and FTC Violations COMPLIANCE DEPT. 

I am writing to address Equifaxs ongoing and egregious failures in handling my credit file disputes, which have escalated into a pattern of alarming and malicious inconsistencies. Equifaxs refusal to investigate and resolve the inaccuracies in my credit report has caused significant harm to my credit standing and violated multiple provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) regulations. 

Background and Timeline On XX/XX/year>, I initiated an FTC identity theft report and placed a fraud alert on my credit file following the discovery of fraudulent activity, including the use of a false name ( XXXX XXXX ) and an incorrect address ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). These inaccuracies are tied to a fraudulent XXXX XXXX tradeline, which has already been successfully disputed and cleared with both XXXX XXXX and the collection agency XXXX XXXX. 

Since then, I have provided Equifax with extensive, verifiable documentation to confirm my legal name ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), my current address ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and my employment at XXXX and XXXX XXXX. This documentation includes : A lease agreement in XXXX  form. 
Both short-form and long-form birth certificates.

A W-2 form with my full Social Security Number.

A paycheck stub from my employer, XXXX. 
My marriage certificate. 

Despite accepting and processing this same information, XXXX and XXXX have updated my credit file without issue. However, Equifax has maliciously refused to make these corrections. 

Alarmingly Inconsistent Correspondence Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/year>, I received XXXX pieces of correspondence from Equifax. These letters demonstrate a disturbing lack of consistency, which appears intentional and malicious : 1. In some letters, Equifax states that it is unable to locate my credit file, despite the fact that other correspondence acknowledges my dispute.

2. Other letters claim that the dispute I initiated through a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) complaint is frivolous, without providing any evidence or explanation to support this determination. 
XXXX. Additional letters state that Equifax is unable to verify my identity, despite having received the same documents that XXXX and XXXX used to resolve my disputes. 

This blatant inconsistency in Equifaxs communication not only undermines the credibility of its dispute resolution process but also highlights Equifaxs refusal to take my case seriously.

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Equifaxs actions constitute clear violations of the FCRA, including but not limited to : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation ( 1681i ( a ) ) : Equifax has failed to conduct a proper investigation into my disputes, as evidenced by contradictory responses and its refusal to act on clear documentation.

2. Failure to Correct or Delete Inaccurate Information ( 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ) : Despite receiving verifiable proof, Equifax has not corrected the false name, address, or fraudulent tradeline in my credit file.

3. Failure to Notify Data Furnishers of My Dispute ( 1681i ( a ) ( 2 ) ) : Equifax is required to notify the original data furnishers of my disputes. Its failure to do so has allowed fraudulent information to persist on my file.

4. Deeming Legitimate Disputes as Frivolous ( 1681i ( a ) ( 3 ) ) : Equifax improperly labeled my dispute, initiated through the CFPB, as frivolous, in direct violation of the FCRAs requirements to assess disputes in good fait

h. 5. Failure to Provide Results or Verification ( 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) - ( 7 ) ) : Equifax has not provided clear or consistent results of its investigation or the methods it used to verify the inaccurate information on my credit report. 6. Failure to Honor Fraud Alerts ( 1681c-1 ) : Equifax has disregarded the fraud alert initiated on XX/XX/year>, failing to take the necessary precautions to protect my credit file from further misuse. 

Violations of FTC Guidelines Equifax has also failed to comply with FTC regulations, particularly the FTC Safeguards Rule, which requires credit reporting agencies to protect consumer data and ensure the accuracy of credit files. By rejecting legitimate documentation and mishandling my disputes, Equifax has neglected its duty to safeguard my information and provide a reliable resolution process.

Harm Caused by Equifaxs Negligence Equifaxs negligence and malicious actions have caused substantial harm, including : 1. Degradation of My Credit File : The presence of fraudulent and inaccurate information has negatively impacted my credit score, limiting my ability to obtain credit and pursue personal and business opportunities. 2. Emotional Distress : The contradictory an
d dismissive correspondence from Equifax has caused unnecessary stress and frustration.

3. Interference with Employment and Business Pursuits : The inaccurate information has hindered my ability to maintain financial stability and expand my business activities with XXXX XXXX. 

Demands for Resolution To address this matter, I demand the following actions from Equifax : 1. Immediate correction of my name and address to reflect XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
2. Removal of the fraudulent XXXX XXXX tradeline and all associated inaccuracies from my credit file.

3. A detailed explanation of the investigation process and the reasons behind the contradictory correspondence I received.

4. Compensation for damages caused by Equifaxs negligence, including financial harm, emotional distress, and lost time.

5. Assurance that Equifax will comply with all applicable FCRA and FTC regulations in handling my credit file moving forward. 

Legal Consequences If Equifax fails to resolve these issues within 14 days, I will escalate this matter by filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my states Attorney Generals office. Additionally, I will pursue litigation to recover damages caused by Equifaxs blatant disregard for its legal obligations under the FCRA.

I trust that Equifax will take this matter seriously and respond promptly. Please contact me at [ your phone number ] or [ your email address ] to confirm receipt of this letter and provide updates on the resolution process.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : Form
al Complaint and Demand for Compensation for FCRA and FTC Violations COMPLIANCE DEPT. 

I am writing to address Equifaxs ongoing and egregious failures in handling my credit file disputes, which have escalated into a pattern of alarming and malicious inconsistencies. Equifaxs refusal to investigate and resolve the inaccuracies in my credit report has caused significant harm to my credit standing and violated multiple provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) regulations. 

Background and Timeline On XX/XX/2024, I initiated an FTC identity theft report and placed a fraud alert on my credit file following the discovery of fraudulent activity, including the use of a false name ( XXXX XXXX ) and an incorrect address ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). These inaccuracies are tied to a fraudulent XXXX XXXX  tradeline, which has already been successfully disputed and cleared with both XXXX XXXX and the collection agency XXXX XXXX. 

Since then, I have provided Equifax with extensive, verifiable documentation to confirm my legal name ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), my current address ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and my employment at XXXX and XXXX XXXX. This documentation includes : A lease agreement in PDF form. 
Both short-form and long-form birth certificates. 
A W-2 form with my full Social Security Number. 
A paycheck stub from my employer, XXXX. 
My marriage certificate. 

Despite accepting and processing this same information, XXXX and XXXX have updated my credit file without issue. However, Equifax has maliciously refused to make these corrections. 

Alarmingly Inconsistent Correspondence Between XX/XX/2024 I received ten pieces of correspondence from Equifax. These letters demonstrate a disturbing lack of consistency, which appears intentional and malicious : 1. In some letters, Equifax states that it is unable to locate my credit file, despite the fact that other correspondence acknowledges my dispute. 
2. Other letters claim that the dispute I initiated through a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) complaint is frivolous, without providing any evidence or explanation to support this determination.

3. Additional letters state that Equifax is unable to verify my identity, despite having received the same documents that XXXX and XXXX used to resolve my disputes. 

This blatant inconsistency in Equifaxs communication not only undermines the credibility of its dispute resolution process but also highlights XXXX refusal to take my case seriously. 

Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Equifaxs actions constitute clear violations of the FCRA, including but not limited to : 1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation ( 1681i ( a ) ) : Equifax has failed to conduct a proper investigation into my disputes, as evidenced by contradictory responses and its refusal to act on clear documentation. 
2. Failure to Correct or Delete Inaccurate Information ( 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ) : Despite receiving verifiable proof, Equifax has not corrected the false name, address, or fraudulent tradeline in my credit file. 
3. Failure to Notify Data Furnishers of My Dispute ( 1681i ( a ) ( 2 ) ) : Equifax is required to notify the original data furnishers of my disputes. Its failure to do so has allowed fraudulent information to persist on my file. 
4. Deeming Legitimate Disputes as Frivolous ( 1681i ( a ) ( 3 ) ) : Equifax improperly labeled my dispute, initiated through the CFPB, as frivolous, in direct violation of the FCRAs requirements to assess disputes in good faith. 
5. Failure to Provide Results or Verification ( 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ) - ( 7 ) ) : Equifax has not provided clear or consistent results of its investigation or the methods it used to verify the inaccurate information on my credit report. 
6. Failure to Honor Fraud Alerts ( 1681c-1 ) : Equifax has disregarded the fraud alert initiated on XX/XX/2024, failing to take the necessary precautions to protect my credit file from further misuse. 

Violations of FTC Guidelines Equifax has also failed to comply with FTC regulations, particularly the FTC Safeguards Rule, which requires credit reporting agencies to protect consumer data and ensure the accuracy of credit files. By rejecting legitimate documentation and mishandling my disputes, Equifax has neglected its duty to safeguard my information and provide a reliable resolution process. 

Harm Caused by Equifaxs Negligence Equifaxs negligence and malicious actions have caused substantial harm, including : 1. Degradation of My Credit File : The presence of fraudulent and inaccurate information has negatively impacted my credit score, limiting my ability to obtain credit and pursue personal and business opportunities. 
2. Emotional Distress : The contradictory and dismissive correspondence from Equifax has caused unnecessary stress and frustration. 
3. Interference with Employment and Business Pursuits : The inaccurate information has hindered my ability to maintain financial stability and expand my business activities with XXXX XXXX. 

Demands for Resolution To address this matter, I demand the following actions from Equifax : 1. Immediate correction of my name and address to reflect XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
2. Removal of the fraudulent XXXX XXXX tradeline and all associated inaccuracies from my credit file. 
3. A detailed explanation of the investigation process and the reasons behind the contradictory correspondence I received. 
4. Compensation for damages caused by Equifaxs negligence, including financial harm, emotional distress, and lost time. 
5. Assurance that Equifax will comply with all applicable FCRA and FTC regulations in handling my credit file moving forward. 

Legal Consequences If Equifax fails to resolve these issues within 14 days, I will escalate this matter by filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my states Attorney Generals office. Additionally, I will pursue litigation to recover damages caused by Equifaxs blatant disregard for its legal obligations under the FCRA. 

I trust that Equifax will take this matter seriously and respond promptly. Please contact me at [ your phone number ] or [ your email address ] to confirm receipt of this letter and provide updates on the resolution process.

I demand immediate action to address the aforementioned inaccuracies. Your compliance is expected to prevent further harm and uphold your obligations under federal law. 

Pursuant to FCRA 605B, you are legally required to block all fraudulent accounts and remove unauthorized inquiries within 4 days of receiving this dispute and the herein-mentioned documentation. 

As previously referenced, I was a victim of the XXXX data breach, one of the largest breaches in history, which compromised the personal information of millions of individuals, including sensitive data such as Social Security numbers and financial records. This breach most definitely played a critical role in the unauthorized access and misuse of my personal information, resulting in the fraudulent accounts and inquiries outlined below. 

Fraudulent Accounts ( I dispute the following ) : XXXX : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$1200.00} XXXX XXXX : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$560.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX  : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$0.00} XXXX : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$590.00} XXXX  XXXX XXXX : Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX, Amount : {$640.00} Unrelated Unauthorized Inquiries ( I dispute the following ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Date of Inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX The harm caused by these unrecognized and unauthorized accounts and inquiries has been significant, severely damaging my creditworthiness, financial stability, and mental well-being. These inaccuracies have magnified the financial and emotional toll on my family as we recover from a natural disaster. A strong storm hit our area on a rainy day, causing the roof of our home to rupture and sustain significant damage. As a result, rainwater poured into the house, damaging the structure, our belongings, and essential property. The aforementioned fraudulent accounts and inquiries have further delayed my ability to rebuild stability and provide for my family. 

It is also critical to note that, in my efforts to resolve these inaccuracies, I hired multiple reputable credit repair companies, fully authorized to act on my behalf as permitted by law. Despite this, the credit bureaus employed various cunning and obstructive methods to stall their work, disregarding my lawful authorization and delaying necessary corrections to my credit report. Such actions have magnified the harm caused by the herein-detailed inaccuracies and undermined my rights under the FCRA. 

Failure to address this matter in a timely and lawful manner will result in formal complaints to the 1Attorney General 's office, as well as potential legal action to seek damages for the harm caused. 

Enclosed, you will find the following supporting documents for your records and in compliance with your identification requirements : 1. A copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report ( # XXXX ).

As you are aware, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) requires that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate and complete information on consumers ' credit reports ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ). Furthermore, the FCRA states that credit reporting agencies must remove information that is no longer accurate or complete ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ). Additionally, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has issued guidance stating that credit reporting agencies should remove paid charged-off accounts from consumers ' credit reports ( CFPB Bulletin XXXX XXXX. This guidance is consistent with the FCRA 's requirement that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate and complete information. Moreover, the FCRA also requires that furnishers of credit information, such as Discover Bank, ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information furnished to credit reporting agencies ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ). As the furnisher of the credit information , Discover Bank has a responsibility to correct and update the information to reflect the payment of the charged-off account. In addition, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure ( CARD ) Act of 2009 requires that creditors, such as Discover Bank, provide accurate and complete information to credit reporting agencies ( 15 U.S.C. 1666c ). The CARD Act also prohibits creditors from furnishing information to credit reporting agencies that is inaccurate or incomplete. Furthermore, the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has stated that the removal of paid charged-off accounts from credit reports is a best practice for credit reporting agencies ( FTC Staff Report, "" 40 Years of Experience with the Fair Credit Reporting Act '' ). The FTC has also emphasized the importance of accurate and complete information on credit reports ( FTC, "" A Guide for Consumers : How to Dispute Credit Report Errors '' ). 


In my case, the charged-off account was paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX. Despite this, the account remains on my credit reports. 


I request that you take immediate action to remove this account from all three credit reporting agencies. As the furnisher of the credit information , Discover Bank has a responsibility to correct and update the information to reflect the payment of the charged-off account. 


I would appreciate it if you could provide me with written confirmation of the removal within 30 days.

Dear XXXX XXXX, Thank you for contacting PayPal XXXX XXXX. My name is XXXX XXXX and I am glad to assist you with limited account. 


We appreciate your interest in PayPal ; however, I have reviewed this for you, and I see that PayPal had made a strong and tough decision to permanently limit your account which means that you can no longer use this PayPal account for your transactions. I do apologize for providing this information to you. PayPal reserves the right to limit access to any account reported to be involved in possible fraudulent or high risk behavior. We review many factors before coming to a decision to restrict an account permanently. This is not something we do without proper consideration. We also can not disclose any specific reason as to why this account has been permanently restricted. PayPal 's investigation is confidential and proprietary. 



It's a good thing that there's no available balance on that account that will be held for 180 days since this is now the best opportunity to check for other payment processor outside PayPal to receive payments for your business. 



I appreciate your understanding on this matter. It is my pleasure to assist you. Thank you for choosing PayPal.

They also did not produce the proper paperwork or disclose pertinent information, making me look non-compliant before legal action was taken. Throughout my dealings with them, I constantly invoked my consumer rights which was disregarded. Credit Acceptance would not reveal information until I paid, which felt like extortion. 

Here is an email that was sent to my bank requesting a refund after I found out Credit Acceptance lied.

Good afternoon, Payment of {$520.00} plus {$3.00} processing fee on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Confirmation number XXXX. 

As far as my research goes, Credit Acceptance does not have a refund or cancellation policy. I spoke to someone from Credit Acceptances Redemption Department on Monday and he confirmed this. 

The summary of the credit dispute is as follows : I was led astray and became a victim of every deceptive method from credit acceptance since day one. I was diligently attempting to settle the impasse between myself and credit acceptance on numerous occasions but all they care about is money. They change have plenty of agents who are experts at being rude, harassing, lying, and overall being consummate unprofessionals. My car was repossessed without a notice to cure from Credit Acceptance and no note left by the repo agent to assure my car wasn't stolen which is illegal. 

Credit Acceptance gave me the runaround since XXXX about the whereabouts of the car and had their agents lie by having me believe they couldn't disclose information of the location ( XXXX ) until I paid them the {$520.00}. Because of this, I couldn't retrieve my personal items which were stolen and or destroyed by the towing company, according to credit acceptance. They are trying to absolve themselves from any responsibility when they facilitated everything to keep the car. 

I ended up paying the above amount just to keep credit acceptance from harassing and threatening me. Once I did, they immediately let me know where the car was. When I arrived to pick up the car it was full of scratches, dents, there was damage to the anti-theft system, mud all over the floorboards and all my personal items of value were missing. They even took the car manuals and original parts off the car. I called credit acceptance and they would not let me speak to a supervisor at first, when I finally did, I was told that they have no account of the car being damaged and they have inspection photos of the car after repossession, supposedly. They will not show me these photos. 

I paid credit acceptance to procure my vehicle in the same condition I had it before repossession. Sadly, this was not the case and since credit acceptance is feigning ignorance about what happened, I angrily refused to take the car. I will not pay for something I don't have. 

There is currently a investigation with Credit Acceptance regarding the damage of the vehicle. It is to my understanding that the money should be refunded and held in my account until Credit Acceptance concludes their investigation.

Read some of the reviewers whose stories are similar to mine dealing with credit acceptance.

Proof that any interest or fees added to the balance are lawful and agreed upon in the original terms. 5. Proof of compliance with Geo
rgia state licensing and third-party debt collection bonding requirements.

6. Proof of all legally required notices sent to me before reporting this debt to consumer reporting agencies.

I have reason to believe that this debt is invalid, and I requested the above information to verify its legitimacy. Additionally, I reviewed the licensing database at www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org and found that Midland Credit Management does not appear to have a license to collect debts in Georgia, where I reside.

To date, Midland Credit Management has not provided the requested documentation or validation of the debt. Furthermore, reporting this alleged debt without proper validation or notification may constitute "" debt parking, '' a violation of consumer rights established in *FTC v. XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX : I request that the CFPB take the following actions : 1. Investigate Midland Credit Managements practices regarding the reporting and collection of this alleged debt. 
2. Require Midland Credit Management to provide complete validation of the debt or remove the item from my credit report immediately.

3. Ensure compliance with Georgia state laws for debt collection, including licensing and bonding requirements.

4. Address any violations of FDCPA or other applicable consumer protection laws.

I have attached copies of my dispute letter, supporting documentation, and any related correspondence for your review. 

Supporting Information : Date of Dispute Letter : XX/XX/year> Account Reference : XXXX Contact Information : If further information or documentation is required, I can be reached at the address provided above or via email at XXXX.

I feel the process lacked transparency, as I was not given a clear explanation of how the amount was calculated or why the debt was sold to a third-party collection firm instead of allowing me to resolve it directly with TD Bank XXXX Additionally, I am concerned about the accuracy of how the account was reported to credit bureaus during and after this process. 

They initiated legal action swiftly after the account became delinquent.

Incident Details : Date of Unauthorized Transactions : XXXX XXXX XXXX Merchant Involved : XXXX Amounts and Timeline : {$0.00} ( initial test transaction ) XXXX XXXX {$500.00} ( completed ) XXXXXXXX XXXX {$300.00} ( completed ) XXXXXXXX XXXX  {$100.00} ( completed ) XXXXXXXX XXXX  {$100.00} ( declined due to insufficient funds ) XXXXXXXX XXXX These transactions occurred within minutes of each other, rapidly depleting my account balance. I did not authorize any of these transactions, nor have I ever used XXXX or purchased cryptocurrency in my lifetime. 
Actions Taken : Immediate Contact with Ace Elite : I called Ace Elite within minutes of receiving text alerts about the transactions. Despite my swift action, I was informed that they could not act while the transactions were still pending. However, the funds had already been deducted from my account.

Disputes Raised : I formally disputed the transactions with Ace Elite and requested a freeze or reversal. I was told I must wait for the transactions to clear before further action could be taken, leaving my account vulnerable. 
FTC Complaint : I submitted a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), outlining the suspected fraudulent activity and the possibility that my information was compromised by an online merchant or third-party vendor using mirroring software to intercept payment data. 
Suspected Fraud Source : I suspect the compromise originated from an online merchant/vendor that had access to both my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Ace Elite Card information. These cards were used with select subscription-based services, narrowing the potential breach point to specific vendors. 
Request for Immediate Assistance : I am seeking your assistance to : Investigate Ace Elites handling of this situation, including their delay in addressing the fraudulent transactions.

Determine why Ace Elite failed to act on an obvious pattern of suspicious activity.

Ensure the return of my stolen funds totaling {$900.00}. 
Take steps to prevent future occurrences of such incidents, including stricter oversight of merchants handling sensitive consumer data. 
Supporting Documents : I have attached the following : Transaction alerts and details. 
Correspondence with Ace Elite.

Copy of my FTC complaint.

Any additional relevant evidence.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I hope for a resolution that includes the recovery of my funds and assurance that Ace Elite and associated institutions will take stronger measures to protect consumers.

This is my first experience using Venmo. I activated and verified my account on XX/XX/year>.

I believe this fee was applied in error, as my payment was made on the due date as required. 

Details of the Issue : The payment in question was submitted on XX/XX/year>, which was the specified due date on my billing statement. 
The payment was processed through automated phone system. 
Despite making the payment on time, I was still charged a late fee of {$29.00}. 
Reason for My Request : According to the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), late fees should not be assessed when payments are made on or before the due date. Additionally, as a consumer, I ensured the payment was made within the time frame outlined in my account agreement. If there were issues with the processing time on Comenity Bank 's end, that should not be attributed to me as the account holder. 

I kindly request that Comenity Bank credit the late fee back to my account as I complied with all payment deadlines. 

Requested Resolution : A reversal of the late fee charged to my account. 
Clarification on how this issue occurred and confirmation that my account is in good standing. 
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I appreciate the CFPBs support in helping resolve issues like these fairly and in accordance with applicable laws.

Immediately after the deposit, I attempted to withdraw the funds, but the platform displayed an error message stating, Dont worry, your funds are safe. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that my account verification status had been inexplicably revoked. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been trying to resolve this issue daily. I submitted all required documents through their app, including a scanned XXXX passport and my XXXX  REAL ID ( front and back ). After receiving no resolution, I also emailed the same documents directly to their support team as suggested. Despite my compliance, my verification remains pending, and my funds are still inaccessible. 

I have proof of my previous verified status, the submitted documents, and all communications with Blockchain.com. However, the company has failed to provide clear communication or any meaningful resolution, leaving my funds effectively frozen without justification. 

This situation is deeply concerning, particularly because it appears to be part of a broader issue with Blockchain.coms handling of user accounts and funds. Their actionsor lack thereofraise serious questions about their business practices and regulatory compliance. 

I am reaching out to your agency as I believe this matter requires oversight and investigation to protect consumers like myself. I am happy to provide all relevant documentation to support this case.

This erroneous information could negatively impact my ability to obtain future insurance coverage and may have other detrimental consequences. 

I have attempted to resolve this issue with XXXX XXXX, but my efforts have been unsuccessful. 

I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action against XXXX XXXX for submitting false and misleading information to the Ohio Department of Insurance. I also request that LexisNexis Risk Solutions investigate the accuracy of the information provided by XXXX XXXX and correct any inaccuracies in my credit report or any other records maintained by LexisNexis.

2024-12-25,Debt collection,I do not know,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"My credit report shows a reputed collection account XXXX with TCM INCORPORTED-CORINTH with different opening dates, balances, first date of delinquency, balance due, and/or last date of activities. I have never had an account with this company nor any record of any type of first notice of debt including rights to dispute from this company. And if I, by chance, even though I have no recollection nor tangible record, naively spoke with a representative of this company over the phone about this debt, I was not in

formed by that representative that I had a right to dispute this debt nor a specific timeframe to do so. 15 USC 1692g 809. V
alidation of debts ( a ) Notice of debt ; contents states that within XXXX days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( XXXX ) a statement that unless the consumer, within XXXX days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector. XXXX XXXX XXXX  definition of the word receipt is- a writing acknowledging the receiving of goods or money ; proof, evidence. I have never signed nor received any type of acknowledgement receipt from a mailing service for any mail from this company. I am familiar with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Had I signed a receipt of notice for the proper and legal documentation from this company, I wouldve immediately responded asking for lawful verification of debt or copy of court ordered judgement well within the lawful 30 days allotted. After receiving my response letter with receipt, this company would have to legally cease from collection attempts and remove the account from my credit reports until their proof of verification is sent back to me. This company has reported to my credit reports without observing the FDCPA laws. My credit has been impacted adversely because of this companys irresponsibility.

My credit reports also show that TCM INCORPORTED-CORINTH has provided this alleged account with inaccurate information. The FCRA requires that all data reported from the credit reporting agencies, creditors, or furnishers on a consumer 's report be 100 % ACCURATE, 100 % VERIFIABLE, and 100 % TIMELY. This means no data can be reported that can't be legally PROVEN to be 100 % accurate. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. My XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX credit reports all show different open dates, balances, first date of delinquency, balance due, and/or last date of activities for this same exact account. Therefore making this alleged account full of inaccuracies. 

This is erroneous and flawed reporting that is listed on my credit reports. Not only did TCM INCORPORTED-CORINTH not follow lawful FDCPA communications protocol, but it has also broken FDCPA False or Misleading Representations protocol as well. A debt collector, in collecting a debt, may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation. Specifically, a debt collector may not falsely represent the character, amount, or legal status of the debt, or of any services rendered, or compensation he or she may receive for collecting the debt. A debt collector may not communicate, or threaten to communicate, false credit information or information that should be known to be false, including not identifying disputed debts as such. Each of my 3 credit reports show different information instead of them all showing the exact same information. This is considered a false and misleading representation that this company has submitted to the credit reporting agencies.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has begun to aggressively litigate companies who continuously violate consumer laws. According to consumerfinance.gov, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) took action against the nations two largest debt buyers and collectors for using deceptive tactics to collect bad debts. The Bureau found that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX bought debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacking documentation, or unenforceable. Without verifying the debt, the companies collected payments by pressuring consumers with false statements and churning out lawsuits using robo-signed court documents. The CFPB has ordered the companies to overhaul their debt collection and litigation practices and to stop reselling debts to third parties. 
The CFPB found that XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect debts that they knew, or should have known, were inaccurate or could not legally be enforced based on contractual disclaimers, past practices of debt sellers, or consumer disputes. The companies also filed lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves. These practices violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the XXXX XXXX XXXX Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

The website also stated that Encore and XXXX XXXX XXXX threatened and deceived consumers to collect on debts they should have known were inaccurate or had other problems, said CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX. Now, the two biggest debt buyers in the market must refund millions and overhaul their practices. We will continue to take action to protect consumers from illegal and obnoxious debt collection practices.

Just as the CFPB took action against the above companies, I am asking the CFPB to take action against this company as well. Please help me get this account removed immediately and conduct an investigation on this company. As a consumer, Im publicly publishing this descriptive complaint on consumerfinance.gov so that others can learn from my experience and so that this government agency can use this information to help work with other violations and complaints from consumers regarding this company. It is not my duty to provide evidence that this alleged debt is not mine. It is the legal obligation of the debt collector to first prove or provide proof of evidence that they can lawfully collect on any alleged debt before a consumer challenges it, accurately report to the credit agencies, and follow all FC
RA and FDCPA laws. As of today, they have been very unsuccessful to do so.

2024-12-25,Credit card,Store credit card,Closing your account,Can't close your account,"I have been battling a fraudulent Kohls account that was created using my name and Social Security Number since XX/XX/year>. I discovered it on my monthly XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit report and they advised me to contact the credit bureaus and request an investigation. The alert informed me of a HARD INQUIRY against my credit report stating : It looks like a lender recently checked your credit report. This typically happens when you apply for a new credit card or loan. 
INFORMATION FOUND Lender : KOHLS/CAPONE Inquiry XXXX I called the credit bureaus and confirmed the credit Fraud Alert in my file requiring creditors to call me at the designated telephone number whenever anyone applies for credit using my name or Social Security Number. They advised me to first contact Kohls and ask them to close the account and investigate how the account had been created, since it was a violation of the Alert.

I attempted to report the fraudulent account to Kohls at XXXX, and XXXX, the number listed for Kohls when a card is lost, stolen, or never received as listed below : ( TABLE INSERTED ) However, Kohls representatives repeatedly refused close the account or have it removed from my credit report. I spoke with "" XXXX '' a XXXX in that department, but XXXX refused to even investigate the matter. After a long discussion, he admitted that he was not really in the fraud department but only took new applications, and gave me a different number to call XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX for fraud reports : XXXX. However, the supposed Fraud department only had pre-recorded messages prompting me to make a payment, and if I pressed XXXX the operator failed to answer or cut me off. 

In the meantime, I contacted the credit bureaus again to inform them of Kohls response. They confirmed that the Fraud Alert on my file had the correct phone number of XXXX and explained that the Kohls employee processing that credit application would have easily seen the Fraud Alert with my name and telephone number and instructions to call me before processing the application. They said Kohls Corporate was in violation, and the Bureau would flag the account in my record indicating that there was an issue with that creditor. 

Eventually, Kohls Fraud Department responded, and I spoke with XXXX ( Employee ID # XXXX ). She did find the fraudulent account, but stated that The Account has a restriction on it, which she said meant that she could only disclose information to the person who opened the account. XXXX then said she would have to verify me by confirming my address and telephone number in their file. However, when I gave her my information, she said it did not match the account holders information in her computer. I begged politely, citing the Fraud Alert instructions, but she repeated Kohls Company Policy over and over, raising her voice at me, that per company policy she could only investigate the account or close it with the consent of the person who opened it as identified in her computer. 

When I reminded her that the account had been created by someone pretending to be me, and without my knowledge or consent, in violation of the credit bureau Fraud Alert requirements, she put me on hold for about 10-15 minutes. When she came back, she said that she could agree to close the account, but only if I agreed to pay the balance of {$480.00}. 

I was surprised that there was a balance, since I had already reported the fraud several weeks prior and the credit bureau flagged Kohls as a fake credit card. When I asked XXXX for the purchase history, she refused to disclose any information about how the items were bought or the purchase dates, claiming that Kohls had to protect their customers. of course, that meant, Kohls feels its more important to protect their criminal employees than their unsuspecting innocent customers with good credit scores.

I then asked her if Kohls would work with Federal law enforcement, since it was obvious that their management was not willing to work with the Credit bureaus, and she said They ( meaning Kohls Corporate ) are not interested in pursuing criminal charges against anyone for opening fraudulent accounts. She eventually agreed to file a dispute on the account, and said Kohls would send me a letter in 30-60 days with their decision. 

I contacted the credit bureaus again, and was told that my credit report still reflected the same KOHLS/ CAPONE account, but now with a balance of {$480.00}, which had accrued sometime after I reported the fraud to Kohls . They said Kohls had re-reported it as an active account. 
The INFORMATION FOUND now stated : Lender : KOHLS/CAPONE Date account opened : XX/XX/year> Balance : {$480.00} Account number : XXXX... 

The credit bureaus also stated that they had received no instructions from Kohls to remove the account from my credit file, and suggested that Kohls refusal to investigate or close this account after multiple requests meant that the perpetrator was likely a Kohls Corporate employee.

In view of this new information that Kohls was condoning or ignoring criminal activity within their ranks, I then reported the account as Identity Theft to the Federal authorities informing them of Kohls Company Policies regarding fraudulent accounts. After the Federal filing, I did receive a letter from Kohls stating that they had closed the account but this was already the end of XXXX more than 2 months after I first alerted Kohls of the fraud. 
I was at peace for about 6 weeks, but it was a false sense of security.

Somehow, Kohls again re-opened the fraudulent account just a few days ago, as revealed in a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of a HARD INQUIRY by KOHLS/ CAPONE against my credit report dated XX/XX/year>. 

XXXX also informed me that my credit score had dropped by another 30 points as a result of the Kohls false credit applications for the THIRD TIME.

When I inquired with Kohls, they gave me the same run-around, insisting that only I could have re-opened the account and that this proved that it was not fraudulent.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Formal Dispute and Demand for Permanent Removal of Fraudulent Account To Whom It May Concern, I am formally disputing the accuracy and legitimacy of the account listed under XXXX XXXX XXXX which is reflected as a charge-off on my credit report. This account is entirely fraudulent, as I have previously provided comprehensive documentation proving that : 1. The vehicle was never repossessed, as falsely claimed. 2. The vehicle was stolen and involved in fraudulent activity by third parties associated with the dealership, which has been documented and reported. 3. I was never informed of any repossession, rebuild, or resale of the vehicle. Given the overwhelming evidence, XXXX XXXX XXXX is knowingly perpetuating this fraudulent charge-off by allowing it to remain on my credit report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) guidelines, it is illegal to report false or inaccurate information on a consumers credit file. I demand the immediate and permanent removal of this account from my credit report. Failure to do so will leave me no choice but to escalate this matter by filing a formal complaint with the CFPB and pursuing legal action to protect my consumer rights.

Details of Dispute : Account Holder : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Issue : The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  financed under this account was sold to me under fraudulent circumstances by individuals who later stole the vehicle. These events make the loan terms and subsequent repossession invalid.

Supporting Documentation : I have enclosed the following documents to substantiate my claim : 1. A copy of the police report documenting the fraud and theft. 2. A copy of the Court Case Number XXXX. Any additional correspondence with XXXX XXXX regarding the dispute. I kindly request that your agency investigate this matter promptly and remove this incorrect information from my credit report in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Please notify me of the results of your investigation in writing. This has now been settled in a Justice of Peace Court and will be investigated. If additional information is needed to process my dispute, please contact me at XXXX or XXXX I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX 1.

Bad Faith : Acting in a way that is contrary to fair dealing and honest practices. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Formal Demand for Resolution of Fraudulent Loan and Resulting Damages To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally demand resolution of a fraudulent and unethical situation involving the vehicle loan associated with my name, XXXX. The actions taken by XXXX XXXX, as outlined below, have caused me significant financial losses, damage to my credit, and emotional distress. The men who opened this loan knew that because of my age and no prior auto loan history that I was the perfect target to fraudulently obtain and maintain an illegal loan. Summary of Events : 1. I made a down payment of {$3000.00} and paid $ XXXXmonth for four months on a vehicle that was fraudulently sold to me. 2. I paid a total of {$920.00} in insurance premiums during this period. 3. The vehicle was illegally repossessed by the dealership and sold at auction for {$4100.00}, yet XXXX XXXX reported this as a charge-off on my credit report, causing substantial harm for 20 months. 4. XXXX XXXX failed to contact me or address the fraudulent activity until I filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). Impact of XXXX XXXX Actions : Financial Losses : A total of {$6000.00} in payments and expenses. Credit Damage : My credit has been negatively impacted for 20 months, leading to financial strain and potential loan denials. Emotional Distress : This situation caused undue stress, leading to depressive episodes and significant emotional hardship. Demand for Relief : T o resolve this matter and avoid further legal action, I am demanding : 1. Reimbursement of all financial losses totaling {$6000.00}. 2. Compensation for credit damage in the amount of {$10000.00}, or an appropriate amount based on your valuation. 3. Compensation for emotional distress in the amount of {$10000.00}. 4. Removal of the fraudulent loan and charge-off from my credit report. All consideration is respected however this matter should be taken seriously before I move forward legally. Response Deadline : I expect a written response to this letter, including your proposed resolution, no later than XX/XX/XXXX If I do not receive an acceptable response, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter further through legal action, filing complaints with regulatory agencies, or both. Conclusion : This matter is urgent and has caused significant hardship. I trust that XXXX XXXX will act in good faith to resolve it promptly. Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am contacting you regarding a fraudulent auto loan in my name connected to a XXXX XXXX vehicle. After discovering this account on my credit report, I investigated and uncovered significant evidence indicating that this loan was opened fraudulently without my knowledge or consent. Background of the Fraud : On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXX XXXX through a third-party dealership in XXXX, Texas, operated by XXXX XXXX . In XX/XX/XXXX, the vehicle was unlawfully taken under the pretense of repair and never returned. On XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that XXXX XXXX XXXX reported the loan as charged-off, claiming the vehicle had been repossessed, rebuilt, and resold. This is untrue, as the vehicle was stolen, and I was never notified of any repossession or sale. Action Taken : I have already reported this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and have sent a demand letter requesting resolution & monetary relief. Evidence strongly suggests that fraudulent activity between XXXX XXXX, the dealership, and possibly your company facilitated the creation of this account and illegally ran it as a charge off for 20 months without contacting me. There is no proof of communication to me at this time for which my landlord at this address stated he never received ant letters from XXXX XXXX. Request for Immediate Action : I am requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX 1. Remove the fraudulent account from my credit report immediately. 2. Issue written confirmation that I bear no liability for this loan. 3. Provide any documentation your company has related to the origination and handling of this account. ( For my purposes ) If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate legal action. Evidence of fraud will support my case, including any negligence or willful misconduct by your company in approving this loan without verifying my consent. Please consider this email an urgent notice of dispute under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and respond no later than XX/XX/XXXX. I can be reached at XXXX or XXXX should you require additional information. I look forward to your prompt response. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX All documentation is for your records proving my claim that this is fraud. I am still seeking monetary relief from XXXX XXXX for my financial losses emotional distress and credit damage before I take legal action. I will be forwarding this email to a lawyer of mine who has been informed of illegal activities at hand.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am filing this complaint against TransUnion due to their refusal to block fraudulent information from my credit report despite my submission of an official FTC Identity Theft Report, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). TransUnion has not only misrepresented the validity of the documentation I provided but has also delayed taking action to remove fraudulent inquiries from my credit profile. I am seeking immediate action from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to ensure that TransUnion follows the law and removes these fraudulent inquiries from my credit report. 

Details of the Issue : XXXX. Identity Theft Report Submitted : On XX/XX/year>, I received a communication from TransUnion stating that they could not block the fraudulent information on my credit report because the FTC Identity Theft Report I submitted was deemed invalid. However, this report was officially filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) via their website, www.identitytheft.gov, and is a valid, government-certified document. The report includes several identifying features that distinguish it as authentic : Government Seal confirming its legitimacy. Document Number that is unique to the repor
t and can be verified. 
XXXX XXXX from the FTC, along with my wet signature, to authenticate the document. 
Identifying markers located in the top-right corner of the document, proving its authenticity. 
According to Section 605B of the FCRA, TransUnion is required to block fraudulent information from my credit report upon receipt of a valid FTC identity theft report. TransUnions refusal to accept the report as valid is a misrepresentation of the facts and a violation of federal law.

2. Delays in Removal of Fraudulent Inquiries : Despite providing all required documentation through the CFPB portal for swift resolution, TransUnion has failed to act promptly. FCRA Section 605B mandates that credit reporting agencies must block fraudulent information within a reasonable timeframe, usually within 30 days of receiving the identity theft report. TransUnion has failed to meet this deadline and has caused unnecessary delays in resolving this issue.

Furthermore, FTC regulations under 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2 require credit bureaus to take prompt action to remove fraudulent information. TransUnions delay in removing fraudulent inquiries and their failure to act in a timely manner constitutes a violation of these federal regulations.

3. State Law Violations : In addition to federal laws, California State Law under California Civil Code Section 1785.16 ( part of the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act ) mandates that credit reporting agencies must promptly remove fraudulent information when a valid identity theft report is submitted. TransUnions refusal to act in compliance with this law and their failure to respond within the statutory time frame is a violation of my rights under both federal and California state law.

4. Misrepresentation of Documentation : TransUnions misrepresentation of the FTC Identity Theft Report as invalid is particularly concerning. As per FCRA Section 1681i, when a consumer submits a valid dispute, the credit reporting agency is required to provide an accurate and fair review of the information. TransUnion has failed to do so by rejecting an official, government-issued identity theft report, thereby misrepresenting the validity of my documentation.

5. Request for Action : I am requesting the CFPBs immediate assistance to : Require TransUnion to block the fraudulent inquiries from my credit report in compliance with the FCRA and California state law.

Ensure that TransUnion acknowledges and accepts the valid FTC Identity Theft Report as a legitimate document for blocking fraudulent information.

Hold TransUnion accountable for the delay in removing fraudulent items, as required by 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2 and California Civil Code Section 1785.16 .

Ensure TransUnion provides timely and accurate communication and resolution of this matter, as stipulated by FCRA Section 1681i.

Supporting Documents : Copy of the FTC Identity Theft Report submitted to TransUnion.

Correspondence from TransUnion rejecting my fraud block request.

Evidence of submission via CFPB portal.

Any relevant state or federal law documents supporting the removal of fraudulent inquiries.

Desired Outcome : I seek the immediate removal of fraudulent inquiries from my credit report, along with proper acknowledgment of the FTC Identity Theft Report by TransUnion, and compliance with federal and state laws regarding the removal of fraudulently reported items.

I trust that the CFPB will assist in ensuring TransUnion complies with all relevant laws and that I receive the relief I am entitled to.

2024-12-25,Debt collection,I do not know,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"Here is a revised letter with specific references to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and language that strengthens your case without including anything that might harm your chances of success. Ive removed unnecessary details and focused solely on the request for the complete removal of the ONEMAIN account. 

Subject : Formal Complaint and Request for Removal of ONEMAIN Account from Credit Report To Whom It May Concern at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am filing this formal complaint regarding the inaccurate reporting of an account by ONEMAIN on my credit report. The debt associated with this account has been sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX, who have since removed their reporting of the debt. However, ONEMAIN continues to report this account, which violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and creates a misleading and inaccurate portrayal of my credit obligations. 

Details of the Issue Creditor : ONEMAIN Account Number : XXXX Problem : ONEMAIN is reporting a debt they no longer own. Since the account has been sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX, it should no longer appear on my credit report. 

Relevant Statutes Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 1. 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : The FCRA requires credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate and up-to-date information. Reporting a sold debt as active or open violates this requirement.

2. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : Furnishers of information, such as ONEMAIN, are required to conduct investigations and correct or delete inaccurate information upon notice of a dispute. 

Request for Resolution I respectfully request that the CFPB require ONEMAIN to : 1. Completely remove the account from my credit report, as they no longer own the debt, and its continued reporting is both inaccurate and harmful.",,OneMain Finance Corporation,NC,27545,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-25,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11263197

Resolution Sought : I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and ensure that XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion take the following actions : 1. Remove all unauthorized inquiries listed above from my credit reports.

This letter serves as an official notice that I expect your compliance in removing any references to child support Account # : XXXX obligations from my consumer profile, as these obligations do not constitute a consumer credit transaction under federal law.

Background of Legal Standing and Precedent The FCRA defines credit as the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debts and defer its payment. As confirmed by the legal precedent in Miller v. Trans Union LLC, child support obligations do not involve an extension of credit nor a deferred payment structure granted by a creditor. Consequently, these obligations do not meet the statutory definition of credit under the FCRA. In Miller v. Trans Union LLC, the court determined that reporting child support obligations on a consumers credit report was impermissible, as such obligations are not rooted in a consumer credit transaction but are, rather, statutory requirements that bear no relevance to a consumers creditworthiness in the context intended by the FCRA.

Violation of Consumer Rights and Potential Liability Given the legal basis established by Miller v. Trans Union LLC, your inclusion of child support obligations in my consumer report constitutes an overreach and misinterpretation of the FCRAs scope. This misreporting infringes upon my rights and has caused unwarranted damage to my consumer profile, impairing my access to credit and creating undue hardship based on information that legally should not be reported. As the FCRA does not mandate or even allow for the inclusion of non-credit obligations, your continued reporting of such information subjects your bureau to liability for damages caused by this wrongful action.

Furthermore, under the FCRA, consumer reporting agencies are mandated to maintain accurate and relevant information on consumer profiles. By including non-credit-related obligations, such as child support, you are in direct violation of these statutory requirements, undermining the accuracy of my consumer report and exposing your bureau to liability for negligent or willful non-compliance.

Demand for Immediate Correction and Compliance I hereby demand the following : 1. Immediate Removal : Remove all references to child support obligations from my consumer report without delay.

2. Written Confirmation : Provide written confirmation that this information has been permanently removed from my credit file and will not appear on future reports.

This letter serves as a formal notice of my intent to pursue all available legal avenues to ensure my consumer rights are protected.

Additionally, be advised that if you fail to comply with the FCRA by continuing to report non-credit obligations on my profile, I am prepared to take all necessary legal actions, including pursuing statutory and punitive damages for willful non-compliance. I am confident that any court reviewing Miller v. Trans Union LLC would uphold the same principles in my case, as the statute clearly protects consumers from irrelevant and damaging reporting of non-credit obligations.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,32216,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-25,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11257625

If XXXX has removed the account due to its unverifiability, I urge you to take similar action and remove this account from my credit report promptly. 
Under the FCRA, all credit reporting agencies are required to ensure that the information on consumer reports is accurate, complete, and verifiable. Specifically : Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies conduct a reasonable investigation of disputed information. If the disputed information can not be verified as accurate, Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ) requires the credit
reporting agency to delete it from the consumers credit file.

Furthermore, under Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), furnishers of information must not provide information that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. 
Since XXXX has deemed this account unverifiable and deleted it, I expect the same resolution from your agency. If this unverifiable debt is not removed within 30 days from the receipt of this letter, I reserve the right to pursue further legal action under the FCRA. 
Failure to comply with FCRA requirements may subject your organization to statutory damages, actual damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees under Section 616 and Section 617 of the FCRA. Additionally, if willful noncompliance is found, I may be entitled to punitive damages.

This dispute is made in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and related regulations, which require furnishers of information to provide timely and accurate notice to consumers regarding negative information.

Violation of Notice Requirements Pursuant to Section 623 of the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) and 12 C.F.R. 1022.7, a financial institution must provide notice to the consumer no later than 30 days after furnishing negative information to a credit reporting agency ( CRA ). Specifically : After providing the initial notice, the institution is not required to send additional notices if subsequent negative information is reported about the same account or transaction. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to comply with this requirement. I did not receive proper notice within 30 days of the negative information being furnished to XXXX and TransUnion. This failure to follow federal law has resulted in inaccurate and unfair reporting on my consumer credit file.

Request for Immediate Action I demand that XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX. Remove the 30-day late payment for XX/XX/year> from XXXX and TransUnion. 
XXXX. Provide evidence that the notice of negative information was sent to me in compliance with 12 C.F.R. 1022.7 and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 7 ). 

Failure to comply with this request will result in further action, including filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and pursuing remedies under the FCRA.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am filing this complaint to address severe inaccuracies and violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) caused by XXXX and the three major credit bureaus ( TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX ). The reporting of my XXXX account is not only riddled with inconsistencies but also reflects a failure to adhere to the legal standards required under federal law. The errors in question have caused undue harm to my financial standing, and I am demanding the complete removal of the account and associated reporting. 

Key Issues with the Reported Account : Inconsistent and Erroneous Reporting Across Bureaus : TransUnion and XXXX report the account as Collection/Chargeoff with a {$0.00} balance but a past due amount of {$38000.00}, indicating conflicting conclusions about the status of the account. 
XXXX, however, reports the account as Late 120 Days with a past due balance of {$3600.00}, entirely inconsistent with the other two bureaus.

This level of inconsistency violates the FCRAs mandate for accuracy and completeness in consumer reporting. The discrepancies alone are sufficient grounds to demand full removal.

Inappropriate Use of 1099-C Language : The account comments reference profit and loss write-off and similar terms, yet there has been no lawful validation or issuance of a 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ).

Under IRS guidelines, a 1099-C signifies the discharge of a debt, which, if issued, would legally indicate the account is no longer collectible. Reporting this account as active, derogatory, or delinquent while potentially treating it as canceled is contradictory and violates my rights under both the FCRA and the guidelines for accurate tax and credit reporting.

Failure to Verify Data : XXXX and the credit bureaus have failed to conduct reasonable investigations into the accuracy of the reported data. As required by the FCRA, furnishers and credit bureaus must ensure that reported information is accurate, verifiable, and complete. The conflicting statuses and balances demonstrate a clear lack of verification and due diligence. 
Misrepresentation of the Accounts XXXX XXXX : The account has been marked as charged off, yet the reporting across bureaus does not align with the actual events or transactions tied to the account. This creates a false and misleading representation of my financial history, further damaging my credit profile. 
Good Faith Reporting Obligation Ignored : Both XXXX and the credit bureaus have an obligation under the FCRA to report consumer information in good faith. However, the gross inaccuracies and discrepancies in this case highlight a pattern of negligence or willful disregard for their legal obligations. 

Legal Basis for Complaint : The inconsistencies and misreporting violate several key provisions of the FCRA, including but not limited to : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Credit reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy in reports.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : Furnishers of information are required to conduct a proper investigation when notified of disputes and must correct or remove inaccurate information promptly. 

Additionally, XXXX XXXX Trans Union LLC establishes that inaccuracies stemming from negligent or willful reporting are actionable under the FCRA. In this case, the errors and contradictions regarding the XXXX account mirror those recognized in the courts findings. 

Specific Demands : Immediate and Permanent Removal : I demand the complete removal of this account from my credit reports across TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX. This includes all references to derogatory remarks, past due balances, and charged-off statuses.. 
Good Faith Correction : As part of your oversight, Im requesting the credit bureaus to implement procedures to ensure good faith reporting and compliance with FCRA standards for all consumers. 
Investigation and Accountability : Compensation for Damages : Given the harm caused by this misreporting, I reserve the right to seek compensation for damages, and financial harm caused by this inaccurate reporting. 

The continued reporting of this account is unlawful, misleading, and harmful.

Transunion has refused to properly investigate or remove fraudulent accounts reported to FTC Identify Theft on my credit file, causing significant harm and violating my rights. 

Background : On XX/XX/XXXX, TransUnion informed me that 7 of the fraudulent accounts I reported on XX/XX/XXXX to the FTC Identity Theft as fraud accounts were "" verified '' per the debt collector, despite being flagged as fraudulent. This response came after 36 days of delay, resulting in an inconclusive decision and allowing the fraudulent accounts to remain on my credit report. 

CRAs Failure to Comply : Despite my clear and lawful dispute, Transunion either failed to perform an adequate investigation or improperly verified the accounts with the original creditors/debtors without validating their legitimacy. 
This constitutes a violation of my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), which requires the CRA to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information and delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable items.

Harm Caused : The continued reporting of these fraudulent accounts is negatively impacting my credit score and financial well-being.

Additionally, I have spent considerable time and resources attempting to correct this issue, only to encounter further delays and noncompliance by Transunion.

- Laws Violated - Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : Transunion failed to meet its obligation to reasonably investigate my dispute under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ). 

Transunion continued to report unverifiable and fraudulent information, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which mandates accurate reporting.

Transunion willful noncompliance with its obligations constitutes a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681n, which provides for civil liability for willful violations, including damages, attorneys fees, and punitive damages.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ) : Transunion improperly relied on a creditor or debt collectors unverified claims without ensuring the accuracy of the account, potentially facilitating abusive debt collection practices.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am filing this complaint against TransUnion due to their refusal to block fraudulent information from my credit report despite my submission of an official FTC Identity Theft Report, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). TransUnion has not only misrepresented the validity of the documentation I provided but has also delayed taking action to remove fraudulent inquiries from my credit profile. I am seeking immediate action from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to ensure that TransUnion follows the law and removes these fraudulent inquiries from my credit report. 

Details of the Issue : XXXX. Identity Theft Report Submitted : On XX/XX/year>, I received a communication from TransUnion stating that they could not block the fraudulent information on my credit report because the FTC Identity Theft Report I submitted was deemed invalid. However, this report was officially filed with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) via their website, www.identitytheft.gov, and is a valid, government-certified document. The report includes several identifying features that distinguish it as authentic : Government Seal confirming its legitimacy.

Document Number that is unique to the report and can be verified.

Digital Signature from the FTC, along with my wet signature, to authenticate the document.

Identifying markers located in the top-right corner of the document, proving its authenticity. According to Section 605B of the FCRA, TransUnion is required to block fraudulent information from my credit report upon rec
eipt of a valid FTC identity theft report. TransUnions refusal to accept the report as valid is a misrepresentation of the facts and a violation of federal law. 
XXXX. Delays in Removal of Fraudulent Inquiries : Despite providing all required documentation through the CFPB portal for swift resolution, TransUnion has failed to act promptly. FCRA Section 605B mandates that credit reporting agencies must block fraudulent information within a reasonable timeframe, usually within 30 days of receiving the identity theft report. TransUnion has failed to meet this deadline and has caused unnecessary delays in resolving this issue.

Furthermore, FTC regulations under 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2 require credit bureaus to take prompt action to remove fraudulent information. TransUnions delay in removing fraudulent inquiries and their failure to act in a timely manner constitutes a violation of these federal regulations.

3. State Law Violations : In addition to federal laws, California State Law under California Civil Code Section 1785.16 ( part of the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act ) mandates that credit reporting agencies must promptly remove fraudulent information when a valid identity theft report is submitted. TransUnions refusal to act in compliance with this law and their failure to respond within the statutory time frame is a violation of my rights under both federal and California state law.

4. Misrepresentation of Documentation : TransUnions misrepresentation of the FTC Identity Theft Report as invalid is particularly concerning. As per FCRA Section 1681i, when a consumer submits a valid dispute, the credit reporting agency is required to provide an accurate and fair review of the information. TransUnion has failed to do so by rejecting an official, government-issued identity theft report, thereby misrepresenting the validity of my documentation. 
XXXX. Request for Action : I am requesting the CFPBs immediate assistance to : Require TransUnion to block the fraudulent inquiries from my credit report in compliance with the FCRA and California state law.

Ensure that TransUnion acknowledges and accepts the valid FTC Identity Theft Report as a legitimate document for blocking fraudulent information.

Hold TransUnion accountable for the delay in removing fraudulent items, as required by 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2 and California Civil Code Section 1785.16 .

Ensure TransUnion provides timely and accurate communication and resolution of this matter, as stipulated by FCRA Section 1681i. 

Supporting Documents : Copy of the FTC Identity Theft Report submitted to TransUnion. 
Correspondence from TransUnion rejecting my fraud block request. 
Evidence of submission via CFPB portal. 
Any relevant state or federal law documents supporting the removal of fraudulent inquiries. 

Desired Outcome : I seek the immediate removal of fraudulent inquiries from my credit report, along with proper acknowledgment of the FTC Identity Theft Report by TransUnion, and compliance with federal and state laws regarding the removal of fraudulently reported items. 

I trust that the CFPB will assist in ensuring TransUnion complies with all relevant laws and that I receive the relief I am entitled to.

2024-12-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,""" I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding unauthorized accounts that persist on my credit report despite my repeated efforts to have them removed. These accounts are causing significant damage to my financial reputation and overall well-being. It is evident that the inclusion of these fraudulent items violates 15 USC 1681b regarding permissible purposes, as the credit bureaus have no legitimate reason to report them without my explicit consent. Please refer to the attached file detailing these items I am disputing. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

2024-12-25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"Hi. I was putting it off for a long time, but finally decided to sumbit this claim. I've applied for the BankAmericard Secured Credit Card on XX/XX/2024, but was denied for the BankAmericard Platinum Plus Mastercard ( a business unsecured credit card ) and eventually have gotten a hard inquiry in vain since I haven't gotten my secured credit card that I should've gotten. I've contacted Bank of America several times as well as mailed three letters to all the three major credit bureaus asking them to remove this hard inquiry from my credit reports. Everything was in vain. Bank of America didn't care at all and didn't want to resolve this. All the three bureaus responded that I authorized Bank of America to access my credit report ( in general ) and they didn't care that I haven't authorized BoA to access my credit report regarding the BankAmericard Platinum Plus Mastercard because I didn't apply for that card, but BankAmericard Secured Credit Card. They suggested me to resolve this issue with the bank itself, but the bank didn't care, so eventually I gave up trying. 
I'm having the html file of the page from the Bank of America website with application ID 's and dates that states that I applied and got denied for a secured credit card as well as two denial letters that state a denial for that Platinum Plus Mastercard. The reference numbers from the html file and denial letters match. Yes, I applied twice since I couldn't believe they rejected my application for a secured credit card since I was ready to put my money there and I had no credit history at that point. 

So, it's clear that they just confused the cards while reviewing my application and it's resulted in a denial + a hard inquiry on my reports and they didn't want to resolve this as well as the bureaus didn't take any actions to at least clarify something. 


I'd like you to take measures regarding this incompetent service that left me with a hard inquiry and no secured credit card in return. 

I'm happy to provide any additional information or evidence I have once you reach back.

2024-12-25,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Complaint Against Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . 
Subject : Formal Complaint Against Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . for Violations of Federal Consumer Financial Protection Laws, Breach of the FTC Holder Rule, Fraudulent Transfers, Non-Compliance with the XXXX XXXX, and Coercive Collection Practices Related to Private Student Loans Originating from Wachovia Bank I. Overview of the Complaint This complaint highlights Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . 's systemic violations of federal consumer protection laws, the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Holder Rule, XXXX XXXX requirements, Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) obligations, and its continued participation in fraudulent debt collection practices stemming from private student loans originated by Wachovia Bank in XXXX. 

Despite multiple enforcement orders from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and ongoing federal oversight, Wells Fargo continues to engage in deceptive, unfair, and coercive practices, perpetuating fraudulent debt tied to a defunct and discredited institution, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, which was shuttered for predatory practices and fraud in XXXX under the ownership of XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). 

Wells Fargos failure to comply with basic legal requirements during the sale and transfer of its private student loan portfolioincluding its inability to provide chain-of-title documentation, XXXX compliance logs, and verifiable ownership recordsdemonstrates a pattern of willful misconduct, negligence, and contempt for federal regulations. 

II. Key Facts and Timeline Origination and Transfer History : In XXXX, a private student loan was originated by Wachovia Bank for education at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
In XXXX, Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia and assumed control over its student loan portfolio. 
In XXXX, Wells Fargo sold/transferred its private student loan portfolio to XXXX XXXX XXXX a subsidiary of XXXX ) XXXX 
Fraudulent Institution and Predatory Practices : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX owned by XXXX ) was found guilty of predatory and fraudulent lending practices that led to its closure in XXXX. 
Wells Fargo knowingly continued to collect on loans tied to this institution, despite the clear evidence of fraud, misrepresentation, and coercion in loan origination. 
FTC Holder Rule ( 16 C.F.R. 433.2 ) : The FTC Holder Rule mandates that any holder of a consumer credit contract is subject to all claims and defenses that the debtor could assert against the seller of the goods or services obtained with the proceeds of the credit. 
Despite clear evidence of fraud and misconduct by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, Wells Fargo has failed to honor borrower defenses against repayment under this rule, instead choosing to transfer and perpetuate these illegitimate debts. 
XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX et seq. ) : Wells Fargo has failed to provide verifiable XXXX compliance documentation, including timestamps, IP logs, or audit trails showing borrower consent for electronic signatures. 
Promissory notes marked "" Electronic Signature on File '' lack supporting evidence of legitimate compliance with the XXXX XXXX. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) : Wells Fargo failed to provide clear and conspicuous disclosures regarding loan terms, repayment schedules, and borrower obligations. 
This lack of transparency violated TILA requirements and undermined borrowers ' ability to make informed financial decisions. 
Chain-of-Title and Ownership Gaps : Wells Fargo has failed to produce clear chain-of-title documentation demonstrating legal ownership of the loans from Wachovia through Wells Fargo to XXXX XXXX. 
Documentation gaps and ambiguities create serious doubts about Wells Fargos legal authority to service, transfer, or collect on these loans. 
Failure to Comply with Existing CFPB Orders : Wells Fargo remains under CFPB-enforced court orders and sanctions for financial misconduct. 
Despite these orders, Wells Fargo has continued to demonstrate a blatant disregard for compliance obligations, particularly in the realm of private student loan servicing. 
III. Specific Violations by Wells Fargo FTC Holder Rule ( 16 C.F.R. 433.2 ) : Wells Fargo failed to honor borrower claims and defenses against fraudulent loans originating from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
The Holder Rule applies explicitly to Wells Fargo, as they were a subsequent holder of these contracts and knowingly facilitated the continuation of fraudulent debt collection. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq. ) : Failure to provide verifiable proof of electronic consent, including audit logs and compliance records. 
No evidence demonstrating that electronic signatures met federal compliance standards. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) : Failure to provide accurate and clear disclosures on loan terms and repayment obligations. 
Failure to ensure borrowers understood key terms at origination and during subsequent servicing transitions. 
Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536 ) : Engaging in unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices ( UDAAP ) through fraudulent loan transfers, improper disclosures, and coercive collection tactics. 
Misrepresenting their legal authority to collect on debts and violating multiple consumer protection mandates. 
Failure to Maintain Accurate Chain-of-Title Documentation : Wells Fargo has failed to produce valid assignments or original promissory notes showing uninterrupted ownership rights. 
This creates a legal ambiguity about Wells Fargos standing to service or transfer these debts. 
IV. Consumer Harm and Broader Implications Fraudulent Debt Perpetuation : Borrowers are being forced to repay fraudulent and unenforceable debts tied to a defunct institution with a proven track record of fraud. 
Coercive Collection Tactics : Wells Fargo and subsequent servicers continue to harass borrowers with collection threats, despite lacking the legal standing to enforce repayment. 
Systemic Financial Harm : Borrowers have suffered irreparable financial damage, reduced credit scores, and emotional distress due to Wells Fargo 's systemic failures. 
Breach of Consumer Trust : Despite being under CFPB enforcement orders, Wells Fargo has repeatedly violated consumer protection laws with impunity. 
V. Relief Sought Immediate Investigation and Audit : A full investigation into Wells Fargo 's loan origination, transfer, and servicing practices related to Wachovia-originated private student loans. 
Document Production : Compel Wells Fargo to provide : Original promissory note Complete chain-of-title records XXXX compliance audit logs Immediate Suspension of Collection Activities : Halt all collection activities and adverse credit reporting related to these loans until full compliance is verified. 
Financial Restitution : Order Wells Fargo to provide full financial restitution to affected borrowers. 
Enhanced Oversight and Accountability : Increase CFPB oversight, mandatory compliance audits, an

d executive accountability measures on Wells Fargo. VI. Consumer Call to Action If you have been impacted by Wells Fargos p
rivate student loan practices : File a complaint with the CFPB, Contact the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), Reach out to your State Attorney General, Engage with consumer advocacy groups : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

VII. Conclusion Wells Fargo 's continued violations represent a staggering breach of consumer trust, financial law, and regulatory compliance. Their failure to produce required documentation, uphold borrower rights under the FTC Holder Rule, and comply with federal laws underscores a pattern of systemic fraud and misconduct. 

The CFPB must take swift and decisive action to ensure borrower protections, financial accountability, and corporate transparency.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,PA,19438,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11262865

On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regarding a fraudulent credit card account opened in my name with GS Bank USA ( Apple Card ). Two days later, I received a response from Apple stating that I was somehow found liable for this account. The response included the instruction, If not already submitted, submit the following documents if you would like this decision to be reconsidered. For your reference, I have attached Apples email, a screenshot of the CFPB complaint ( # XXXX ), and the initial documents submitted with the complaint, including the FTC Identity Theft Affidavit. 

My concern lies in the timeframe of Apples investigation. In just two days, a determination was made that this account is mine, despite my submission of multiple identity theft reports and supporting evidence. Apple has not disclosed the methods used to verify the accounts ownership, which leaves me questioning how this conclusion continues to be reached given the extensive evidence I have provided. It appears that Apple, along with XXXX and XXXX, has failed to thoroughly review the information submitted. 

This fraudulent account has had a severe and lasting impact on my credit report. In an attempt to resolve this issue, I even paid the balance on the accountdespite not being liablehoping this would prompt a deeper review of my case. However, I am still facing the consequences of someone elses wrongdoing. 

After researching the appropriate legal steps, I am formally requesting that Apple Card, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ), block this fraudulent information on my credit report resulting from identity theft. According to this statute, this action must be completed within four business days of receiving this complaint. I have again provided all relevant details and documentation for the affected accounts below for your review.

However, this is causing the due date to shift forward, resulting in no autopay being charged because the due date shifts forward before autopay due date. We would request you to make payments on the schedule due dates so that autopay can be charged along with any additional payments if made any. 

Furthermore, the payments are first applied to the due amount. Once the due amount is satisfied, any remaining payments are allocated to the principal. From the payment history, we can see that many payments have been applied to the principal after the due amounts were satisfied. Similarly, the {$1000.00} payment was first applied to the due amount for XXXX, and once the due amount was satisfied, the rest was allocated to the principal.

I never deleted any auto payment, for a matter of fact I cant. If your system did : That is your SYSTEM 's fault. I would recommend you recalibrate it and add manually the monthly payments missing by the faulty system. I am not penalized to do as many extra payments as I wish and on the days I wish as per my contract. As well the due amounts are satisfied monthly and charging extra interest is inappropriate and illegal. I will request you assign a CPA or someone qualified to manually- if needed- to fix this billing statements. 
I should see my interest payments be reduced, not increased on my monthly payments. 
I will also remind you that it is your financial duty to assure ALL and not most of my extra payments go towards PRINCIPAL as per my contract, failing to do such will be a breach of contract and I will be in need to report your company to Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as potentially seeking legal action towards this billing dispute.

On XXXX XXXX I contacted XXXXXXXX XXXX via, phone to request a copy of the purchasing agreement letter, as I believe it is my right to verify the legitimacy of the debt being claimed. Despite my efforts, I have not received any correspondence or documentation from them. 

This lack of response not only raises concerns about the validity of the debt but also appears to be a violation of my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I kindly ask the CFPB to investigate this matter and assist in resolving it.

2024-12-25,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Opening an account,Confusing or missing disclosures,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXL branch of Chase Bank to open a new account. Every one was professional and courteous. I opened a three month CD and a savings/ checking account via checks drawn from my XXXX XXXX  account. 
A requirement for the Total Checking account at Chase is either direct deposits by an employer or government agency. I commented that it would not be a problem because I receive social security benefits and I would transfer the direct deposits from XXXX XXXX to Chase. 
What occurred is the basis of my complaint. 
That following Monday, I contacted Social Security to change my benefits from being deposited to XXXX XXXX Chase. I was alarmed to learn that it had been done already - by the bank. I sent an email to the branch manager and the gentleman who opened my accounts inquiring as to who did this transfer. The day passed with no response. That gave me concern. The following day I called Chases fraud department inquiring who had done the transfer. They could not give me that information, but it apparently is a service the bank provides. 
Now maybe this was mentioned to me when I was at the bank, but without signing a document giving the bank explicit authority to do the transfer, I did not think it would be possible, but apparently it is. I believe this practice is a red flag for possible fraudulent transfers. 
For example, I could not change my dividend deposits, which involve a much smaller amount than my monthly social security deposits, without putting the request in writing and returned to XXXX. 
As a consumer and an XXXX, I believe this practice at Chase needs to cease. I believe a risk management procedure, something akin to having an express written approval form for authorizing any such transfers be used for the future. If such a form was included in the disclosures I signed at the bank, I did not receive a copy, nor was I aware that this would be done without my calling social security first to authorize. Any paper work following the phone call, if needed, could be provided by the bank. 
Please note that in a few days, I did receive a polite and professional phone call from the banker to discuss and I learned this is a practice provided by the bank as a courtesy. I believe this should be reconsidered.

Below, I outline the details of their actions, the legal violations, and the relief I seek. 

Background of the Dispute On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a collection letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, c/o XXXX XXXX XXXX , regarding an alleged debt. I exercised my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) and disputed the debt in writing via certified mail, requesting proper validation. Proof of delivery is included with this submission. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to provide legally sufficient validation of the alleged debt. Instead, they supplied incomplete and vague documentation that does not meet the requirements of proper validation. Specifically, the documents failed to include : A signed contract or agreement proving I owe this debt. 
A chain of title showing ownership of the debt if it has been sold or transferred. 
A full and detailed account history substantiating the amount claimed. 
Despite their failure to validate the debt, XXXX XXXX XXXX escalated the matter by involving multiple law firms, subjecting me to continuous harassment and violations of federal law. 

Prior Complaints Closed Without Resolution I have previously filed several complaints against XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding their failure to provide proper debt validation and their continued collection efforts. These complaints were closed without XXXX sending the correct details to resolve the matter. 

The complaints are as follows : Complaint ID XXXX Complaint ID XXXX Complaint ID XXXX It is unacceptable for these complaints to be closed without a full resolution. I request that this matter remain open until XXXX XXXX XXXX provides all legally required information to validate the alleged debt or confirms in writing that the matter has been resolved and closed.

I explained why I filed the dispute against their client because the Administrative Assistant charged my credit card without my consent, when I was on vacation while I was in another state on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. It was XXXX, XXXX XXXX when I scheduled to make a payment for service completed on that morning, there was a disagreement with the balance due amount. Their client said she would call me back after the disagreement but did not, so I had those funds that were issued by the insurance company back into my savings account. After speaking with their client about the payment disagreement, we agreed to resolve after I returned from my vacation to discuss but that did not happen because their client XXXX charged my credit card twice while I was out of town in another state without my consent. The client Manager asked what he can do to make this better. I asked him to submit his document through the dispute process, he said no and will put me in collection and place a lien on my property. 
I was trying to communicate this to the Collection Attorney associates on XX/XX/XXXX, but they were talking aggressively over me and said you just do not want to pay, called me a XXXX  and are going to file XXXX  XXXX  against me and they hung up. I was trying to come to a resolution but I could not. I did not expect that type of XXXX  and harsh experience from the Collection Attorney. The XXXX  Attorney then called back but I did not not answer after how they talked to me. 

So, after that abuse and harsh telephone call from the XXXX Attorney, I wrote the tracking letter on XX/XX/XXXX, that was schedule to be delivered to their address on XX/XX/XXXX to proceed any future communication in writing regarding a final settlement offer for their client XXXX for the insurance approved amount and just move on. 

The XXXX Attorney disregarded my request to only communicate to me in writing but instead called me on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX to accept the settlement offer for their client XXXX for the insurance approved amount {$1800.00}. Since the XXXX  Attorney told me verbally over the phone that he and his client wanted to finally settle for the agreed amount of {$1800.00} and move on. 

I wrote another tracking letter on XX/XX/XXXX, that scheduled to arrive at the XXXX Attorney address on XX/XX/XXXX in response to the phone conversation that was on XX/XX/XXXX that he and his client wanted to final settle for {$1800.00}. I ask in the written letter that the XXXX Attorney to put the final settlement agreement in writing and then I will be happy to pay them the settlement amount that was approved by the insurance company. This will give me a sound mind. 

After writing to the XXXX Attorney to put the verbal final settlement agreement in writing ; they refused to do so and instead continued to call and send emails saying that they did not agree to a settlement over the phone. Since the XXXX Attorney email communication became problematic and stressful, I asked them to communicate to me in writing. The XXXX Attorney called on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 

The client XXXX XXXX I did not want to pay. The reason I have not paid is because they have not put the final verbal settlement agreement in writing. The XXXX Attorney and their client will put a lien on my property and ruin my credit after I ask that they put the settlement agreement in writing. I believe because of their position as Attorneys, they know how to work the system and to make it more difficult for me with resistance not to put the settlement agreement in writing and move on.",,Richard Stone & Associates,TX,76106,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11261478

I am writing to formally file a complaint against an employee of First Tech Federal Credit Union, XXXX XXXX, regarding his unlawful failure to disclose that he was recording a phone conversation and his subsequent unprofessional behavior. I am also requesting that you assist in ensuring the preservation of all related audio recordings and documentation, as they are essential to an ongoing legal matter. 

Incident Details : On XX/XX/year>, I spoke with XXXX XXXX, a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX at First Tech Federal Credit Union, regarding a financial issue I am facing with the credit union. During the conversation, XXXX XXXX failed to inform me that the call was being recorded. It was only after approximately three minutes of conversation that XXXX XXXX abruptly stated, "" I want to let you know that you are being recorded, if thats okay. '' At this point, I expressed my clear objection, stating, Wait, what? No! I do not give my consent. XXXX XXXX apologized, claiming that he had not had enough time to inform me within the first few minutes of the call. I believe this explanation to be insufficient and untrue, as I did not hear any prior disclosure regarding the recording. 

Unprofessional Behavior : In addition to his failure to disclose the recording, XXXX XXXX conduct was also highly unprofessional and disrespectful. When I attempted to address the matter and ask for clarification, XXXX XXXX responded in an aggressive and dismissive manner. His tone was rude and combative, and he refused to answer reasonable questions about the nature of the recording, particularly when I inquired if I could record the conversation for my own records. His behavior further escalated when he abruptly hung up on me without offering any resolution to my concerns. 

Request for Preservation of Evidence : Given the circumstances and the potential legal implications of this incident, I am formally requesting that First Tech Federal Credit Union preserve all audio recordings of this phone conversation. The conversation is of significant importance to my ongoing legal matter, and I want to ensure that the recordings are not tampered with, altered, or deleted in any way. 

Violation of Law : The failure to inform me of the recording before the conversation started and XXXX XXXX 's refusal to allow me to record the call constitutes a violation of Californias Informed Consent Recording Law, specifically California Penal Code 632 ( a ), which requires that both parties give consent to the recording of any confidential conversation. If XXXX XXXX had intended to record the call, the disclosure should have been made at the beginning of the conversation, before any discussion took place.

Additionally, his rude and unprofessional behavior may be in violation of consumer protection and fair dealing laws under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), which mandates that financial institutions treat consumers fairly and professionally. 

Request for Resolution : I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter and ensure that the following actions are taken : Investigate the actions of XXXX XXXX XXXX and First Tech Federal Credit Union for failing to disclose the recording of the phone call as required by law. 
Preserve the audio recordings of the phone conversation between myself and XXXX XXXX, including any other relevant communications, in relation to the ongoing litigation. 
Ensure that First Tech Federal Credit Union take appropriate corrective action to prevent this unlawful and unprofessional conduct from occurring in the future. 
If this matter is not resolved promptly and appropriately, I will have no choice but to consider taking further legal action to protect my rights and address the damages caused by the mishandling of this situation. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance in ensuring that my rights are upheld.

2024-12-25,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Complaint Against Nelnet ( Firstmark Services ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
Complainant : XXXX XXXX Loan Details : Private Student Loan, Originated by XXXX ( XXXX ), Transferred to XXXX XXXX, Currently Serviced by Firstmark Services ( a Nelnet subsidiary ) Institutions Involved : Nelnet , Inc. ( Parent Company of Firstmark Services ) Firstmark Services XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
Date of Complaint : [ Insert Date ] 1. Overview of Complaint This complaint addresses systemic violations, fraud, and misconduct in connection with the servicing and ownership of a XXXX private student loan initially originated by XXXX, acquired by XXXX XXXX, and currently serviced by Firstmark Services ( a Nelnet subsidiary ). 

Both XXXX XXXX and Nelnet/Firstmark Services have repeatedly failed to comply with federal laws governing loan servicing, debt validation, and electronic signature compliance under the ESIGN Act, Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Despite previous formal complaints to the CFPB, both institutions have continued deceptive and fraudulent practices. This complaint demands escalated oversight, enforcement action, and immediate investigation into the ownership, servicing, and documentation of this loan. 

2. Key Allegations Against XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
A. Failure to Produce Valid Promissory Note and Compliance with ESIGN Act Conversations with XXXX XXXX, Escalation Manager at XXXX XXXX, revealed that XXXX XXXX may not possess proper documentation of the original promissory note or evidence demonstrating compliance with ESIGN Act ( 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq. ) requirements. 
ESIGN mandates : Explicit consumer consent to use electronic records. 
Retention of a valid electronic audit trail ( timestamps, IP addresses, and consent confirmation ). 
XXXX XXXX has failed to provide clear documentation demonstrating valid consent or retention of the original promissory note. 
B. Violation of Truth in Lending Act ( TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) XXXX XXXX failed to provide clear, accurate, and conspicuous disclosures at the origination of the loan, including : Accurate Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ). 
Total repayment cost. 
Explicit terms and conditions of the loan agreement. 
These violations impede the borrowers ability to make informed financial decisions and render the contract potentially unenforceable. 
C. Ongoing Violation of CFPB Court Orders XXXX XXXX is currently under CFPB-mandated court orders for widespread mismanagement across various financial products, including student loans. 
Despite these mandates, XXXX XXXX has failed to implement adequate oversight, internal compliance protocols, or corrective measures for legacy private student loan portfolios. 
3. Key Allegations Against Nelnet , Inc. and Firstmark Services A. Fraudulent and Predatory Servicing Practices Firstmark Services ( Nelnet Subsidiary ) continues to engage in predatory and coercive collection tactics despite documented evidence of loan irregularities. 
These include : Refusal to provide validation of debt upon formal request. 
Obscuring chain-of-title documentation ( XXXX XXXX XXXX Firstmark Services ) . 
Evasive, inconsistent responses to formal inquiries and disputes. 
B. ESIGN Act Compliance Failures Firstmark Services has failed to provide verifiable audit trails or documentation proving compliance with ESIGN requirements, including : Timestamp logs. 
IP address records. 
Explicit evidence of consent to electronic records. 
The loan documents currently state Electronic Signature on File, but supporting records validating this are conspicuously absent. 
C. Violation of UDAAP ( Unfair, Deceptive, and Abusive Acts and Practices, 12 U.S.C. 5531 ) Firstmark has misrepresented its authority to collect on this debt without adequate documentation. 
It has failed to provide transparency regarding loan ownership and servicing authority. 
These acts violate UDAAP principles as outlined in the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ). 
D. Systemic Transfer and Servicing Errors During the transition from XXXX XXXX XXXX Firstmark Services, critical documentation appears to have been lost, destroyed, or deliberately withheld. 
Errors include : Misapplication of payments. 
Inconsistent reporting to credit bureaus. 
Lack of clear debt ownership validation. 
E. Failure to Address Prior Complaints Multiple formal complaints were filed with XXXX XXXX , including requests for documentation validation and compliance records. 
Nelnet acknowledged the existence of fraudulent activity but failed to take corrective action. 
F. CFPB Findings Against Nelnet ( XX/XX/XXXX Report ) The XX/XX/XXXX CFPB Supervisory Highlights Report documented systemic failures in Nelnet 's servicing practices, including : Deceptive billing statements. 
Mismanagement of documentation during loan transfers. 
Improper denial of repayment plan applications. 
Lack of adequate call center staffing, leading to unresolved borrower concerns. 
These findings align directly with the issues raised in this complaint. 
4. Legal and Regulatory Violations Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ( ESIGN Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq. ) Failure to provide audit trails and electronic consent validation. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) Failure to provide accurate disclosures during origination. 
Unfair, Deceptive, and Abusive Acts and Practices ( UDAAP, 12 U.S.C. 5531 ) Ongoing deceptive servicing practices. 
Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5481 et seq. ) Violations of federal consumer protection laws. 
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. ) Failure to validate debt when formally requested. 
5. Relief Sought from the CFPB Immediate Investigation : Comprehensive investigation into XXXX XXXX and Nelnet/Firstmarks loan documentation and servicing compliance. 
Debt Validation : Mandatory production of original promissory notes, audit logs, and ESIGN consent records. 
Corrective Action : Enforcement orders to prevent continued deceptive practices. 
Penalties and Fines : Civil penalties against both institutions for repeated violations of federal laws. 
Borrower Relief : Suspension of adverse collection actions and credit reporting until compliance is achieved. 
6. Final Remarks This complaint highlights systemic fraud, predatory lending, and servicing failures spanning multiple institutions. Both XXXX XXXX and Nelnet/Firstmark Services have demonstrated blatant disregard for regulatory requirements, borrower rights, and CFPB mandates. 

This matter must be escalated to the highest levels of oversight within the CFPB, with appropriate enforcement actions, fines, and legal measures pursued to ensure accountability. 

XXXX XXXX, as it seems customary for these institutions to send delinquency notices during the holiday season while failing to meet their most basic legal obligations.

I sent a follow-up communication to Wise on XX/XX/year>, again requesting a refund and providing further clarification about the cancelled XXXX transaction. 

Wise responded again when I called them by phone on XX/XX/year>, reiterating their decision to keep the account closed and refuse a refund. 

I subsequently sent a formal demand letter to Wise on XX/XX/year>, demanding the return of my funds and threatening further legal action. 

To date, I have not received a refund of the funds held in my Wise account, and the account remains closed. The key issue is the account closure following a cancelled transaction and the subsequent refusal to return my funds.",,TransferWise Ltd,,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11263058

Despite this charge-off, BMW Financial Services reopened the account on XX/XX/XXXX, and reported XXXX missed payments. 
2. Discrepancy in Reported Balances : The balance reported across the three major credit bureaus is inconsistent : XXXX : {$0.00} balance and listed as charged off. 
XXXX : {$19000.00} balance, listed as charged off. 
XXXX : {$38000.00} balance, listed as charged off. 
XXXX. Issues Identified : Account Reopening : BMW Financial Services reopened a previously closed account and reported additional delinquencies, which appears to be an attempt to retroactively harm my credit score.

Balance Inconsistencies : The balances reported across the three credit bureaus do not match and fail to align with the accounts charged-off status.

Potential Violation of State and Federal Laws : Under Missouri state law, improper practices in debt collection or credit reporting may constitute unfair and deceptive practices. 
Federal laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), require accurate and consistent reporting.

4. Request for Investigation : I request that the CFPB investigate BMW Financial Services for these irregularities.

The reopening of a charged-off account and the reporting of inconsistent balances are damaging to my creditworthiness and may constitute unlawful reporting practices.

5. Attachments : Screenshots of credit bureau reports showing the discrepancies in balances and reporting details. 


This account was closed as of XX/XX/XXXX. I have no documentation indicating that the account was reopened legitimately or why new negative information is being reported. Reopening a charged-off account and reporting new derogatory information appears to be a false representation of the accounts status, potentially violating the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act ( RSMo 407.020 ). Under this law, it is unlawful to engage in unfair or deceptive practices that harm consumers financially.

Violation of Missouri State Law The actions described may also constitute unfair or deceptive practices under Missouris consumer protection laws. The inaccurate reporting of late payments and the reopening of a charged-off account without proper basis are misleading and cause undue financial harm. I reserve the right to escalate this matter to the Missouri Attorney Generals Office if the inaccuracies are not corrected promptly.

Requested Action I kindly request that you : 1. Investigate the BMW Financial Services account and verify its reporting accuracy.

2. Remove any inaccurate late payment history that occurred after the charge-off date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 
3. Confirm whether the account was reopened legitimately or close it with the original charge-off date reflected. 

I have attached supporting documents to assist with your investigation, including : A copy of my credit report highlighting the errors. 
BMW Financial Services correspondence. 

Please conduct your investigation in compliance with the FCRA and state laws and provide me with the results within the required timeframe. If you find the information to be inaccurate, I request that you update my credit report to reflect the corrected details. 


Requested Resolution : Remove the inaccurate reporting from all three credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ).

2024-12-25,Debt collection,Telecommunications debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"I am filing this complaint against Sunrise Credit Services XXXX for attempting to collect a fraudulent debt of {$3100.00} on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX. This is the second time XXXX XXXX XXXX has attempted to collect this same debt. The first attempt was through XXXX. Both companies have reported this fraudulent account, negatively impacting my credit despite evidence I provided proving the debt is not mine. 

Details of the Issue : 1. First Collection Attempt by XXXX  Earlier this year, XXXX attempted to collect {$3100.00} on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX for a phone bill that is not mine. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed the debt with XXXX in writing, including a copy of a police report documenting identity theft. 
I also worked with all three major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) to establish that this account was fraudulent and should not appear on my credit report. 
2. Second Collection Attempt by Sunrise Credit Services XXXX months ago, Sunrise Credit Services began attempting to collect the same {$3100.00} for the same fraudulent account. 
I contacted Sunrise Credit Services and informed them that the account is fraudulent, just as I had done with XXXX. 
I also sent Sunrise Credit Services a written dispute, again including the police report and other supporting evidence proving that I am a victim of identity theft. 

Ongoing Negative Impact : Despite my efforts, both XXXX  and Sunrise Credit Services have continued to pursue collection of this fraudulent debt. The repeated collection attempts have caused undue stress and have negatively affected my credit score, impacting my ability to access credit.

Supporting Evidence : Copy of the police report documenting identity theft. 
A copy of my written dispute letter sent to XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ). 
A copy of my written dispute letter sent to Sunrise Credit Services. 
Communications with all three credit bureaus confirming the account was fraudulent. 

Requested Resolution : I request the CFPB to investigate this matter and ensure the following : 1. Sunrise Credit Services immediately ceases all collection efforts for this fraudulent debt.

2. Any negative credit reporting related to this debt is removed from my credit file by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and Sunrise Credit Services. 
3. Written confirmation from Sunrise Credit Services, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX that they will no longer pursue collection of this fraudulent account. 

Conclusion : I have provided ample evidence to prove this account is fraudulent, including a police report and dispute letters to both collectors and the credit bureaus. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX repeated attempts to collect this debt through different agencies violate my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter promptly.
