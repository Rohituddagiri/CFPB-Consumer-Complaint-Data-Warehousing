Since then, I have made every effort to get my finances back on track, and I have ensured that all my payments are up to date. I deeply value my credit and am committed to maintaining a good payment history moving forward. 

As a loyal customer, I kindly request your assistance in removing these late payments from my credit report as a gesture of goodwill. I believe this removal would more accurately reflect my overall creditworthiness and my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. 

I greatly appreciate your time and understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding this request. If you require any additional information or documentation, please feel free to contact me.

These errors, as furnished by the creditors listed below, violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am requesting the CFPBs assistance to ensure these matters are thoroughly investigated and that the information is corrected or removed if it can not be substantiated.

Disputed Accounts and Issues 1. XXXX  XXXX ( Account XXXX. XXXX ) Issue : The account is reported as a charge-off with {$460.00} written off and past due as of XX/XX/XXXX. These details appear inconsistent with my payment history and balance updates. 

Request : Verify the payment history, balance, and charge-off status. Remove or correct any discrepancies if substantiation is lacking. 

XXXX. XXXX ( Account XXXX. XXXX ) Issue : The account is listed as repossessed with an {$8100.00} balance past due. However, the payment history and status updates are unclear and inconsistent with my records. 

On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I was involved in a severe car accident while completing a XXXX delivery. The vehicle was rear-ended, causing serious neck and back injuries that left me unable to work or generate income. The car remained at the repair facility for approximately XXXX months while the at-fault partys insurance processed the claim and handled repairs. 

During this time, I contacted XXXX Customer Service to explain my situation and request assistance due to these extenuating circumstances. Despite my efforts to keep them informed, XXXX attempted to repossess the vehicle from the repair facility. I managed to make a payment to delay the repossession temporarily, but the vehicle was ultimately repossessed in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Request : XXXX. Validate the reported payment history, repossession status, and balance. 

XXXX. Provide documentation detailing the accounts payment history, repossession procedures, and any charges or balances resulting from the repossession. 

XXXX. Remove or correct any inaccuracies or unverifiable information in compliance with the FCRA. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) Issue : The account reflects a past due balance of {$80.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX, alongside delinquencies that do not align with my records. 

Request : Investigate and verify the reported payment history and past due amounts. Remove unverifiable information. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account No. XXXX ) Issue : The account is listed as charged-off with {$220.00} past due. However, prior dispute attempts have not resolved discrepancies in the payment history or charge-off details. 

Request : Reinvestigate and correct any errors in the charge-off or payment records. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account No. XXXX ) Issue : The account is inaccurately listed as a charge-off. Additionally, I have never signed an agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX. My original contract was with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and there is no documentation proving my obligation to XXXX. 

Request : 1. Confirm the accuracy of the charge-off status, payment history, and balance.

2. Remove unverifiable information, as required under : 15 USC 1666b : Billing error correction.

15 USC 1681i : Credit reporting dispute requirements.

15 USC 1681s-2 : Obligations of furnishers to report accurate data.

UCC 9, Part 6 : Repossession compliance.

Summary of Concerns Many of these accounts reference prior disputes that failed to produce conclusive evidence or rectifications. The inaccuracies harm my credit profile and fail to meet the FCRAs requirements for accurate, complete, and verifiable reporting.

Requested Actions 1. Ensure each disputed account is thoroughly reinvestigated.

2. Remove or correct any unverifiable or inaccurate information.

3. Require furnishers to provide documentation supporting their reporting or correct the records as necessary.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please keep me updated on the progress of your investigation and any actions taken to resolve these disputes.

I have been a responsible and timely payer overall, and I sincerely regret the oversight that caused the late payment in question. 

Account Information : XXXX XXXX : # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  : # XXXX The late payments occurred due to a rare medical condition I was dealing with during that time. This condition caused unexpected health complications that made it difficult for me to manage my financial responsibilities. While I fully understand the importance of making payments on time, my primary focus during that period was on recovering my health, which caused a delay in my payment processing. 

Since then, I have made every effort to get my finances back on track, and I have ensured that all my payments are up to date. I deeply value my credit and am committed to maintaining a good payment history moving forward. 

As a loyal customer, I kindly request your assistance in removing these late payments from my credit report as a gesture of goodwill. I believe this removal would more accurately reflect my overall creditworthiness and my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. 

I greatly appreciate your time and understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding this request. If you require any additional information or documentation, please feel free to contact me. 

Thank you for your consideration.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate, misleading, and potentially unlawful reporting regarding my XXXX  XXXX account that is being furnished to Experian XXXX in XXXX Upon reviewing my credit report, I have identified **multiple violations and inconsistencies** under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which require immediate correction. Identified Violations and Inaccuracies 1. **Reporting Incorrect Status with Past Due Balance and Charge-Off** : - The report reflects that the account has been charged off and closed. However, it simultaneously lists a **past due amount** of ** $ XXXX as of XXXX XXXX. - A charged-off account indicates that the creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible. Per FCRA guidelines, any charged-off balance can not remain reported as past due, as this misrepresents the current status of the debt. XXXX. **Future-Dated Entries** : - The report reflects contradictory **future dates** ( e.g., Status Updated : XX/XX/year>, Balance Updated : XX/XX/year> ). These dates are impossible because this report was generated in XXXX XXXX. Reporting future activity is inaccurate, misleading, and violates the FCRAs requirement for fair and accurate reporting. 3. **Credit Usage at 118 % ** : - The report states that my credit usage is **118 % **, which is mathematically incorrect because the credit limit is reported as ** $ XXXX while the current balance is ** $ XXXX. This reflects inaccuracies in balance calculation or credit usage reporting. 4. **Ambiguity in Comments and Dispute Resolution** : - The comments indicate the account was previously in dispute investigation complete. However, no documentation or outcome of the investigation was provided to me, violating my right to a proper investigation under FCRA Section 611. 5. **Multiple Reporting Violations** : - **Incorrect Balance Reporting** : The balance and credit usage appear overstated. - **Duplicate Reporting** : The account balance and past due amount seem to be inconsistently reported across sections. Additional Violations in Payment History Reporting 1. **Future-Dated Late Payments** : - The payment history shows **late payments for XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and XXXX XXXX. As of todays date in XX/XX/year>, these months have not yet occurred, and future payments can not be accurately reported as late. This constitutes **false and inaccurate reporting** and is a clear violation of FCRA Section 607 ( b ), which mandates maximum possible accuracy. 2. **Inconsistent Reporting with Past Account Status** : - The account has already been charged off and closed as reflected earlier in the report. A charged-off account should not reflect **ongoing monthly late payments**, as the creditor is no longer expecting regular payments. Reporting multiple late payments after the charge-off date is both redundant and misleading. 3. **Adverse Impact on Creditworthiness** : - These inaccuracies in payment history significantly harm my creditworthiness by misrepresenting my financial behavior and account status. Legal Basis for Dispute Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : - **Section 611** requires that disputed information must be investigated and corrected within 30 days. - **Section 607 ( b ) ** requires maximum possible accuracy of information furnished. - **Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ** prohibits furnishers from reporting inaccurate or unverifiable information. - **Section 605 ( a ) ( 5 ) ** prohibits re-aging or reporting obsolete information. The inaccuracies on this report violate these provisions and misrepresent my creditworthiness, causing harm. Requested Action I demand the following : 1. **Immediate investigation** into the inaccurate reporting under FCRA guidelines XXXX 2. **Removal of the account and of the following : - The past due status and amount, as the account is charged off. - Any future-dated entries, as they are impossible and misleading. - The overstated credit usage percentage and balance inconsistencies. - Inaccurate payment history reporting for future months and redundant late payments post-charge-off. 3. **Documentation** of the investigation results and verification of all corrected information. Failure to Comply If you fail to address these inaccuracies within the 30-day timeframe required by law, I will escalate this matter with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX CFPB ) and explore all available legal remedies under the FCRA. I have enclosed a copy of the credit report, including the **payment history**, for your reference.

Despite filing a formal dispute with Experian, they responded with the message : ITEM ALREADY MATCHES THE DISPUTE REQUEST.

The score reduction appears to stem from a Positive Activity : Loan Paid update from XXXX XXXX, which does not justify such a significant decrease. Furthermore : XXXX XXXX confirmed the loan was paid in full and reported positively. 
Experians handling of this matter lacks transparency and accountability. 
Their dispute resolution process has failed to provide me with a meaningful explanation or resolution.

Despite my repeated disputes and requests, Experian has failed to validate or verify disputed items, provide necessary documentation substantiating alleged debts, and address unauthorized credit inquiries on my report. This has been happening since XXXX XXXX XXXX and I have not been receiving proof within the 30-day period or at all. I would have to check online without proof that things had been validated. 

I am also attaching letter that I have request for proof of permission for hard inquires.

Key Issues Reported : Failure to reinvestigate disputed items within the legally required 30-day period, as mandated under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

Lack of evidence proving my legal obligation to pay alleged debts, contrary to FCRA and IRS Code requirements under 26 U.S.C. 6050P.

Unauthorized hard credit inquiries without my explicit written consent, violating permissible purpose requirements outlined in 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ).

These actions have caused significant damage to my creditworthiness, financial opportunities, and emotional well-being. I demand immediate resolution, including : Removal of all inaccurate and unverifiable information from my credit report.

Written confirmation of these corrections.

Compensation for the harm caused, as permitted by the FCRA.

If these issues are not addressed, I will pursue legal action under the FCRA and FDCPA and report the violations to the FTC, CFPB, and my state Attorney General.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,GA,302XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11163239

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am writing to formally dispute an inaccurate entry on my credit report. According to my credit report, XXXX XXXX has listed certain accounts as charged off. However, I have concrete documentation proving that these loans are not in default, and this claim is false. This misinformation has caused undue harm to my credit score and is a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Ohio state laws. 

Details of the Disputed Accounts : Creditor : XXXX XXXX Account Number ( s ) : n/a Reported Status : Charged Off Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Reporting an account as charged off when it has not defaulted constitutes false reporting, which is prohibited under this law. Moreover, Ohios consumer protection laws also mandate that creditors and credit bureaus must report information fairly and accurately, per Ohio Revised Code Section 1345.02, which prohibits unfair and deceptive practices. 

Additionally, in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ), the courts reinforced the obligation of credit reporting agencies to conduct reasonable investigations when a consumer disputes the accuracy of information. Reporting a charge-off inaccurately violates this precedent and further illustrates a failure to uphold proper investigative standards. 

To support my dispute, I have attached the following documents : 1. A copy of my credit report highlighting the inaccurate entry. 
2. Documentation proving that my XXXX XXXX loans are not in default. 
3. [ Any additional evidence, such as account statements or correspondence with XXXX XXXX. ] I request that [ Credit Bureau Name ] investigate this matter promptly and delete the inaccurate charge-off entries from my credit report. Failure to address and correct this issue may leave me no choice but to seek legal remedies under the FCRA and Ohio consumer protection laws. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and expect a written response within 30 days, as required by the FCRA. 

Thank you for your time and cooperation.

I. INACCURATE REPORTING Late Payments on Charged-Off Accounts : It is widely established that once an account is charged off, reporting additional late payments is not permissible. Despite this, the aforementioned creditors have continued to report late payments after charging off the accounts. This practice is both inaccurate and misleading.

Permissible Purpose : I do not give written consent for XXXX, Experian, or XXXX to report these accounts or my personal information further. The reporting of these accounts without my consent constitutes an additional violation of the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which restricts the circumstances under which consumer information may be disclosed.

II. FAILURE TO RESPOND TO DISPUTES I have previously disputed these accounts, and the credit reporting agencies failed to respond within the required 30-day period as stipulated by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). This non-compliance places your agencies in direct violation of the FCRA.

This statement is incorrect and represents a misinterpretation of federal law, specifically the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), and I urge you to review the applicable regulations governing identity theft and consumer rights. 
The Law Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, there is no requirement that an FTC Identity Theft Report be filed with any law enforcement agency for it to be valid. According to this law : 1. Section 1681c-2 ( b ) : A consumer only needs to submit an FTC Identity Theft Report to the credit reporting agency , which is sufficient to block fraudulent information on the credit report. The FTC Identity Theft Report is designed to be used directly by consumers to challenge fraudulent entries on their credit reports without needing any additional action by law enforcement. 
2. No Police Report Requirement : The law does not require a police report in addition to the FTC report. The FTC Identity Theft Report itself is the essential document in resolving fraud-related credit report disputes. The consumer has the legal right to use this document to ensure that fraudulent information is blocked from their credit file within four business days as per FCRA 1681c-2 ( b ).

By claiming that the FTC report must be filed with law enforcement, you are infringing upon my rights and misapplying the law. Your refusal to accept the FTC Identity Theft Report without further law enforcement action is a direct violation of my rights under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which requires you to investigate disputes and ensure the accuracy of the information on my credit report. 

I have been patiently and diligently adhering to my rights as a consumer, providing you with all the necessary documentation to correct the unauthorized information on my credit report. Despite my repeated efforts, including sending you my FTC Identity Theft Report, proof of address, my drivers license, Social Security card, and other forms of identification, my request for removal of fraudulent information remains unaddressed. I have made every reasonable attempt to resolve this matter, ensuring that all documents were submitted correctly and promptly. Yet, you continue to refuse to take any action. 
It is abundantly clear that Experian is intentionally disregarding my rights as a consumer, which is not only unlawful but unethical. Your failure to act, despite receiving all required documentation and my repeated requests, represents a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which mandates that you investigate and correct inaccuracies on a credit report. Your actions amount to gross negligence at best, and willful disregard of my rights as a consumer at worst. 
The Consequences of Experians Unlawful Actions Your continuous refusal to correct the misrepresented information on my credit report is having an extremely detrimental impact on my financial future. The misrepresentation of my credit report has adversely affected my ability to access credit, secured loans, and any financial opportunities that I am lawfully entitled to as a consumer. The unauthorized entries you refuse to remove are obstructing my right to financial freedom and undermining my economic security. 
By failing to act, you are effectively harming my reputation in the credit system, creating barriers that prevent me from moving forward in a lawful and equitable manner. Your actions are not just an inconveniencethey are actively damaging my ability to participate in the economy, access housing, apply for loans, or even engage in basic financial transactions. These ongoing issues are resulting in unjustified financial harm, and Experians refusal to correct the inaccuracies is making this harm permanent. 
Unlawful Practices and Their Impact on Me The persistent disregard of my due diligence is not only unlawful but constitutes intentional harm. Under FCRA 1681n, your continued failure to address these issues may constitute willful noncompliance, subjecting you to punitive damages and liability for all damages caused by your actions. The law is clear : you are responsible for correcting any inaccuracies and for protecting consumers like myself from fraud and harm. Your refusal to follow the law demonstrates a flagrant disregard for my consumer rights, my constitutional rights, and the legal protections afforded to me under the FCRA. 
Additionally, under FCRA 1681o, your failure to perform a reasonable investigation and take action after being given clear, documented proof of my claims makes you liable for actual damages, legal fees, and potentially punitive damages. 
Experians Repeated Failures and the Severity of These Violations You are well aware that this situation is no longer just a simple disputeit is a pattern of unlawful practices. I have sent equitable letters on numerous occasions, clearly outlining the fraudulent activity, providing documentation of my identity, and even filing an FTC report, all in accordance with the law. Despite this, I am still facing civil penalties and denied my consumer rights through your inaction. Your actions have not only been negligent but appear to be a calculated effort to deny my rightful claims. 
This ongoing violation of my consumer rights has reached a point of no return. Your unwillingness to make necessary corrections has made it clear that Experian has no regard for the financial security and well-being of consumers. These actions directly conflict with the FCRA, and Experians continued failure to comply with the law is causing me direct, measurable harm. 
Your refusal to act is not just a slight inconvenience ; it is an active violation of my constitutional rights, civil rights, and the protections provided by federal law. The misrepresentation of my financial standing is undermining my entire future and represents an ongoing financial injury for which Experian is legally responsible.

Unauthorized Addresses to Be Removed XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX Only XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX XXXX authorized. 



Experians Legal Obligation Under FCRA 1681i, you are legally obligated to investigate disputed information on a consumers credit report. The FTC Identity Theft Report is a valid form of documentation to begin that process, and Experian must take immediate action once it is provided. Your failure to recognize this report and insist upon additional, unlawful requirements constitutes an obstruction of my rights. 
Should you continue to insist that a law enforcement filing is required for an FTC Identity Theft Report to be valid, you are subjecting yourself to further liability under 15 U.S.C. 1681n, which allows for the recovery of damages, attorney fees, and punitive damages for willfully failing to comply with the FCRA. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1681o, if this violation is determined to be negligent, you are still liable for actual damages and attorneys fees.

Conclusion I demand that you immediately remove all fraudulent entries from my credit report as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 and 15 U.S.C. 1681i, based on the FTC Identity Theft Report I have already submitted. Any continued refusal to do so will not only violate federal law but also expose Experian to further legal action, including a formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and potential civil litigation for the damages caused by your unlawful actions.

Your attempt to accuse me of a material misrepresentation or error is not only defamatory but also unfounded. An FTC Identity Theft Report, filed under penalty of perjury, is sufficient under federal law to block the disputed information within four business days of receipt. You have failed to comply with this mandate, exposing Experian to legal liability. 
Legal Violations and Case Law 1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 : By failing to block the disputed items, you are in direct violation of the FCRA. Courts have repeatedly ruled that credit reporting agencies can not delay or refuse a proper identity theft claim ( see XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 
2. Civil Rights Violation : By holding false and unauthorized information against my will and disregarding my multiple notifications, you are infringing upon my civil rights under 42 U.S.C. 1983, as you are willfully obstructing my right to accurate credit reporting. 
3. Constitutional Right to Privacy : Your continued retention of disputed personal information violates my Fourth Amendment right to privacy by unlawfully holding unauthorized data despite clear notice and demand for removal. 
Personal Accountability of Experians Back Office Team Let this serve as notice that individual accountability will be pursued against Experians back office team. I will take the necessary legal steps to subpoena records that identify the specific employees who handled my case. Per 15 U.S.C. 1681n, Experian and its employees can be held individually liable for willful noncompliance with the FCRA. You should be aware that Experian has faced similar lawsuits, such as : XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) - Resulted in {$60.00} XXXX awarded for inaccurate reporting and FCRA violations. 
XXXX v. Experian - Courts have repeatedly affirmed Experians duty to investigate and correct disputed items. 
Demands This letter demands the immediate and permanent removal of the following unauthorized accounts, names, addresses, Failure to comply with this demand within the legally required timeframe will leave me with no choice but to : 1. File a formal civil lawsuit against Experian and its back office team for FCRA violations, defamation, and emotional distress.

2. Pursue legal discovery to identify individual employees responsible for this unlawful conduct.

3. Report Experians willful violations to the CFPB, FTC, and State Attorney General for further investigation and penalties.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Subject : Letter of Intent to Sue for Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally notify you of my intent to file a lawsuit against Experian for violating my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically concerning your failure to block and remove inaccurate and fraudulent information from my credit report related to a fraudulent XXXX account. 

As a victim of identity theft, my personal information was unlawfully used to open this fraudulent account. Additionally, my mail was fraudulently redirected to the perpetrator 's address, further exacerbating the situation. Once I discovered these violations, I promptly reported the incident to the police and the U.S. Postal Service to rectify the mail fraud issue. To safeguard my identity, I also enrolled in a credit monitoring system. 

The FCRA mandates that a consumer reporting agency must block reporting of information resulting from identity theft within four ( 4 ) business days of receiving proper notification from the affected consumer. I have complied with all requirements under the FCRA, including submitting : An identity theft report filed with the FTC, Proper identification. 
Despite meeting all legal obligations and formally notifying Experian of the fraudulent XXXX account, more than four business days have passed, and this account remains on my credit report. This non-compliance violates the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, which explicitly outlines the process and timeline for blocking such information. 

Moreover, I have identified additional inaccuracies in how this account is reported. The address associated with the XXXX account is not mine and is not listed on my credit report, further demonstrating its fraudulent nature. The account is marked as "" charged off '' and "" written off, '' indicating that the creditor obtained a tax write-off for the alleged amount. Under federal law, it is unlawful for a creditor to receive a tax write-off and subsequently report an outstanding balance, making the reporting both deceptive and inaccurate. The FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) requires that all information on a consumer 's credit report be 100 % accurate, a standard which Experian has failed to meet in this instance. 

I am once again submitting a copy of my identity theft report along with proper identification. I am demanding that Experian permanently delete and remove the fraudulent XXXX account from my credit report immediately. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will proceed with filing a lawsuit against your company in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Florida, to seek damages for your violations of the FCRA. 

Please consider this letter your final notice to rectify this situation. Should this issue remain unresolved, I will also seek statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney 's fees as allowed under the FCRA. 

I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.

Specifically, XXXX. Account Type - Detail Experian lists the account as "" Auto Loan '', while XXXX and XXXX classify it as "" Installment account ''. This inconsistency should be corrected to ensure the details match. 
2. Payment Status Experian states the account was "" Paid, was past due 30 days two or three times '', while : XXXX marks it as "" Paid or paying as agreed '' ( no delays reported ). 
XXXX states "" Pays account as agreed ''. 
This suggests a possible inaccuracy in Experian if no late payments are confirmed. 
3. Credit Limit Experian does not report a credit limit, whereas XXXX and XXXX show {$0.00}. This creates an information gap. 
4. Date of Last Payment Experian lists the last payment date as XX/XX/year>, while XXXX reports XX/XX/year>. Although the difference is minor, these dates should align across agencies. 
5. Date Last Active Experian reports the last active date as XX/XX/year>, while XXXX states XX/XX/year>. This discrepancy should be reviewed. 

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 USC 16811 ( 7 ) credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. Additionally, under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 USC 1601, it is imperative that all credit information provided is accurate and transparent to protect consumer rights As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccuracies in my credit report. I request that you conduct a more thorough investigation into this matter, particularly considering the following points : 1. Inconsistencies : There are discrepancies among the three credit bureaus regarding this account.

2. Verification Issues : According to Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the FCRA, you are required to verify accounts through original documentation. I request that you provide the supporting documentation you relied upon to verify this account.

3. Consumer Rights : Under Section 611 of the FCRA, if you can not provide adequate documentation to support the validity of this account, you must remove it from my credit report.

4. Accuracy Compliance : Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in my credit report. If the information can not be verified, per 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), I request that you delete any unverifiable information.

I believe 100 % AND THE PROOF IS ATTACH TO THIS COMPLAINT THAN the bureau has failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) in their investigation process. 
Specifically, I wish MORE POINT AND VIOLATION HAVE THE EXPERIAN TO MY RIGHT AFTER THE INVESTIGATION THE ACCOUNT HAVE DISCREPANCIES AND INACCURATE : 1. Failure to Investigate Accurately ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) : After submitting a dispute regarding inaccuracies on my credit report, I did not receive a thorough investigation within the mandated 30-day timeframe. The results of the investigation did not adequately address my concerns.

I have previously submitted an Identity Theft Affidavit, an Affidavit of Truth, and copies of my identifying information to each of the credit bureaus via certified mail, which has been received as evidenced by the return receipts. These documents clearly establish that the following accounts are fraudulent and must be deleted immediately : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I stated Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x ), you are required to investigate and delete any information that can not be verified as accurate within 4 business days when identity theft has been properly reported. Specifically : 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 mandates that credit reporting agencies block fraudulent information within 4 days of receiving an identity theft report and proof of identity.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) requires the deletion of inaccurate or unverifiable information following a reasonable investigation.

Failure to comply with these obligations has been adjudicated in the following court cases, which highlight your liability and lack of compliance : XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX.

The original account belonged to XXXX XXXX XXXX and was later collected by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Since then, the dates of last activity and payment have been inconsistently updated across different credit bureaus. 

Specifically : On Experian, the date of last activity is reported as XX/XX/XXXX, yet the last payment is recorded as XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XXXX and XXXX, the account has been removed and marked as settled. 

However, I settled this account on XX/XX/XXXX. If the information is being sourced from the original creditor or the debt collector, the dates and amounts across all credit bureaus should align. 

Due to these discrepancies, the accuracy of these accounts can not be guaranteed. As a result, I believe the reporting is inaccurate and should be corrected or removed entirely. 

I kindly request that the CFPB investigate this matter and ensure that my credit report reflects accurate and consistent information.

These accounts were opened without my authorization or consent and remain reported in violation of federal laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Despite my valid identity theft report, Experian has unlawfully refused to investigate and remove these accounts, further compounding their violations. 

The accounts and inquiries in question are : Accounts XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, Experian ) XXXX  XXXX. 
Account : XXXX ( Experian ) XXXX  Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, Experian ) XXXX XXXX Auto Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, Experian ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX Account : XXXX XXXX XXXX, Experian ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX ) Inquiries XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( Experian ) XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Experian XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Experians Unlawful Conduct Experian has responded to my dispute with an automated email falsely claiming that my identity theft report and supporting evidence are invalid, stating : "" We are responding to your request that information in your personal credit report be blocked due to identity theft. Based on our review of your request and the information available to us, we have determined that either : your request to block was made in error, or, your request to block information was based on a material misrepresentation, or, you knowingly obtained or should have known that you obtained possession of goods, services, or moneys as a result of one or more of the transactions that you are seeking to block. '' This response is both baseless and illegal. I have complied with all legal requirements, including submitting a valid identity theft affidavit. Experians refusal to block or remove these accounts violates several provisions of federal law : 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 Blocking Information Resulting from Identity Theft : Credit reporting agencies are legally required to block information stemming from identity theft upon receipt of appropriate documentation. Experian 's failure to comply directly violates this statute. 

15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) Permissible Purposes for Reporting : Reporting fraudulent accounts for which I did not authorize the furnishing of data violates permissible purposes under federal law.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) Reinvestigation of Disputed Information : Experian is required to perform a reasonable reinvestigation of disputes. Refusing to investigate and relying on automated responses demonstrates clear noncompliance.

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports : Experian is obligated to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the data they report. Allowing fraudulent accounts and inquiries to remain on my credit report violates this provision.

15 U.S.C. 1681n Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Experians refusal to address valid disputes constitutes willful noncompliance, making them liable for civil damages.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information : The entities reporting these fraudulent accounts have also failed in their legal duty to provide accurate and verified information. 

Conclusion Experians ongoing failure to comply with federal law and their reliance on automated denials are unacceptable and unlawful. I urge the CFPB to investigate Experians conduct and hold them accountable for their violations of the FCRA.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I was taken advantage of due to malpractice while your company broke several laws under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I recently did an investigation on my credit report and I found invalidated, inaccurate, unverifiable, and questionable items that your company is reporting. Your agency is not reporting 100 % correct information. Under 15 U.S. code 1681e ( b ) ( b ) Accuracy of report whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual to whom the report relates. For the past two months I've tried to settle this issue with your company via mail however, I have reasonable evidence that your company is only trying to make times harder on me at the moment by not following reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy. 15 USC 1681b ( 2 ) Permissible purposes of consumer reports also validate that anything reporting on my credit report that I did not consent to is fraud. I DID NOT give written or oral consent to any company listed below to disclose any of my nonpublic personal information. As of XX/XX/XXXX I've notified each company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX  that I am using my right to opt out of their reporting on my consumer report. I have a right to privacy and per the Privacy Act of 1974 as a federally protected consumer, I am now revoking any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non-written, verbal, and non-verbal per 5 USC 552a. Per the FCRA as a federally protected consumer I am now opting out of any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non-written, verbal, and non-verbal per 15 USC 6802. I shall also point out their responsibility pursuant to 15 USC section 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( ii ) : ( a ) RESPONSIBILITIES OF FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES. A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. Your agency along with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, and XXXX XXXX is in violation of multiple laws set forth by XXXX in regard to the following individual accounts of the consumer ( myself ). 15 USC 1681a ( 2 ) ( a ) ( I ) states that the consumer report does not include information solely as to transactions or experiences ( payment history, charge-off status ), between the consumer ( myself ) and the creditor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer ( me ) to any consumer reporting agency ( EXPERIAN, XXXX ) if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, and XXXX XXXX can NOT collect on a XXXX debt. These accounts are now considered certificates of indebtedness per the XXXX and income can NOT be reported on a consumer report. The XXXX clearly defines a charge-off as gross or ordinary income, INCOME DOES NOT GET REPORTED ON THE CONSUMER REPORT which in fact makes the reporting of these accounts inaccurate! I provided a screenshot from the XXXX website. By definition, the XXXX clearly says a canceled debt or charge-off is income. The reporting of these accounts are inaccurate. To further validate that these accounts have been charged-off by each company with the XXXX, I received a copy B of each company 's 1099C filing with the XXXX and I've attached each copy as evidence. According to my consumer report and the 1099C filings with the XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX each company has received a profit loss tax write off as a benefit of reporting debts greater than {$600.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX has obviously written the debt off with the XXXX so they should no longer be reporting these accounts on my consumer report, by doing so they're committing tax fraud. They've already filed the required forms with the XXXX  to notify them that they've took a profit loss, yet these accounts are still reporting these accounts on my consumer report. Maybe EXPERIAN and XXXX XXXX think XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and XXXX XXXX hasn't actually written off the debt attached to the accounts. If that is the case per 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( ii ) these accounts are inaccurately reporting and should be removed immediately. According to my XXXX credit file on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX removed the same accounts that EXPERIAN and XXXX are currently reporting XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. I have attached a copy of the credit report from XXXX that shows the account has been removed. I request that you immediately remove these account from my credit report. Pursuant to 15 USC 6802 ( 1 ) ( c ) companies must not disclose any of my personal information unless I was given an explanation on how I can exercise a non-disclosure option, I am supposed to be notified of my eligibility to opt-out every thirty days. 16 CFR 313.7 ( f ) states there is a continuing right to opt-out, and a consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time. I've never been notified that I'm eligible to opt out. This is a violation of 15 USC 6802. Obligations with respect respect to disclosure of personal information.

Issues with the Reporting : The historical data for this account is inaccurate and largely missing from my credit report. This account was paid in full before being closed, which XXXX  and Experian failed to reflect accurately. This account is missing historical data such as payment information/ correct date of first derogatory needed to verify the age of the negative status of this account. Retaining such incomplete information misrepresents my creditworthiness and violates my rights under the FCRA.

I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and hold Experian accountable for violating the FCRA. Please delete this inaccurate account from my credit profile for the following reasons : Publishing inaccurate and incomplete historical account information.

Failing to remove an account that possibly exceeds the allowable 7-year reporting period. This inaccurate reporting has harmed my credit profile and caused undue frustration. I kindly request a full investigation into XXXX practices regarding this matter. 

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to a resolution.

2024-12-15,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX [ CFPB Address ] Washington XXXX DC XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, Re : Complaint Against Bank of America I am writing to file a formal complaint against Bank of America regarding their handling of multiple cashier 's check deposits and subsequent actions that have caused significant financial and emotional distress. 

Issue Background : Delayed Availability of Funds : On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a cashiers check from XXXX XXXX, drawn on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and deposited it into my checking account at Bank of America. 

Upon depositing the check via the mobile app, I received a notification that the check would not clear for four days. Despite contacting customer service and explaining the urgency, I was informed that Bank of America needed to retrieve their funds first. 

I subsequently canceled the transaction and deposited the check at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America requested the check be returned to them, causing me to owe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$560.00}. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX threatening legal action if the amount was not paid within XXXX days. 

Improper Handling of Cashier 's Check to XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX # XXXX advertised a XXXX XXXX XXXX for sale. I contacted the dealership and confirmed the automobile was available. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas, and requested a cashier 's check in the amount of {$10000.00}, made payable to XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the automobile was stolen from my residence, and a XXXX Police Department auto theft report was made. Officers were dispatched to my residence, and a XXXX Police Report was filed. 

While Bank of America was supposedly investigating the matter, the same automobile was sold to another individual who retained an attorney and obtained a standing judgment for {$48000.00} from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. 

Despite the stolen vehicle and the standing judgment, Bank of America claimed they could not recover the funds from the {$10000.00} cashier 's check to XXXX XXXX. This contradicts their ability to reverse the cashiers check from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Bank of America also falsely claimed they did not have a police report, despite having received the same police report I uploaded in the initial complaint form. 

Issues : Delayed Availability of Funds : The delay in clearing a cashiers check, which represents guaranteed funds, was unreasonable and caused significant financial hardship. 

Improper Handling of Canceled Transaction : Despite canceling the transaction, Bank of America requested the return of the check, causing undue financial liability. 

Failure to Reverse Transaction : Bank of America did not process or acknowledge the reversal of the {$10000.00} cashiers check to XXXX XXXX. 

Lack of Support and Resolution : Bank of America 's customer service failed to provide adequate support and resolution, exacerbating the issue. 

Request : I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate Bank of Americas handling of these matters and ensure that : Bank of America covers the {$560.00} owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX due to their error. 

Bank of America processes the reversal and provides compensation for the {$10000.00} cashiers check to XXXX XXXX. 

Bank of America reviews and revises their policies on holding cashiers checks to prevent similar issues in the future. 

Bank of America provides a formal apology and compensation for the financial and emotional distress caused. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

These errors are a direct violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g. This blatant disregard for their legal obligations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), FCRA, and FDCPA reflects systemic failures that perpetuate inequities and reinforces the XXXX XXXX  that disproportionately harm XXXX XXXX  like myself. By failing to uphold these statutes, these agencies are not only threatening my financial future but are also undermining the very principles of fairness and equality that these laws were designed to protect.

The accounts and inquiries listed below are unauthorized, fraudulent, or inaccurately reported. Their continued presence on my credit reports has caused significant financial harm, including limiting my access to credit and opportunities to support my growing family. Despite providing the required documentationincluding proof of identity, an FTC fraud report, and a statement identifying these items as fraudulentthese agencies have failed to comply with their obligations to block or remove this information under 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2 within the four days mandated by law. 

Please remove unauthorized/fraudulent inquiries and accounts : ExperianAccounts : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX I demand the immediate removal of these accounts and inquiries from my credit reports within the four days required by 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2.

15 U.S. Code 1681c2 - Block of information resulting from identity theft Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. 

Failure to comply will result in legal action. By willfully violating the FCRA, I am willing to settle your civil liability damages I have suffered as a result of your violation for {$1000.00} pursuant to FCRA 616 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681n ]. Should you fail or refuse to settle the matter by tendering payment in the amount of {$1000.00} within ten ( 10 ) calendar days of receipt of this notice and demand, I will seek actual damages, which are greater than {$1000.00}.

Specific Discrepancies and Ambiguities : Status Inconsistency : XXXX lists the account as "" Charge-Off '' with the last payment as XX/XX/year>. 
Experian states the "" Account Charged Off '' with a date discrepancy ( XX/XX/year> ) and marks a consumer dispute unresolved. 
XXXX reports "" Charged Off as Bad Debt '' with an unclear payment history. 
These inconsistencies indicate an inadequate investigation and verification process, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). 
Ambiguous Payment History : Each bureau provides differing dates of delinquency and "" charge-off '' status reporting, which contradict the accurate timeline. 
No payment history is displayed on XXXX 's report, violating 1681e ( b ) regarding the accuracy of all data presented.

Verification Procedures : I demand the bureau disclose the reasonable procedures used to verify this account, as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). Failure to disclose such procedures violates my consumer rights. 
Consumer Statement and Dispute Status : Experian mentions "" Item in Dispute by Consumer '', yet it remains unresolved. This violates your duty under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) to investigate disputes promptly and mark accounts as accurate only after proper validation. 
Violations of Law Identified : FCRA Violations : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Failure to maintain and follow reasonable procedures for maximum possible accuracy. 
15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) : Failure to reinvestigate disputed items and correct or delete inaccurate information.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : Failure of the furnisher to conduct a thorough investigation after being notified of a dispute. 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) Violations : 15 U.S.C. 6802 : Non-consensual sharing of inaccurate data with credit bureaus.

15 U.S.C. 6804 : The bureaus failure to safeguard the integrity of consumer data during reporting. 
Recent Data Breaches Impacting Consumer Trust : Given the National Consumer Protection Database ( NPD ) breach, I question the validity of verification procedures for my personal data. This further necessitates proof that accurate records exist and were verified securely. 
Relief Sought : Immediate Deletion : I request that this account be permanently deleted from my credit file if your investigation can not prove its absolute accuracy. 
Procedural Documentation : Provide documentation of the methods used to verify this information. 
Cease Reporting : Stop reporting this account until your procedures are brought into compliance.

Subject : Request for Deletion of Credit Report Dear CFB Experian, XXXX, XXXX and all 3rd party unauthorized credit reporting agencies.

I am writing to formally request the deletion of my credit report due to multiple security breaches and the lack of any active lines of credit under my name. I have experienced five security breaches, including incidents involving XXXX, for which I have received settlements. Additionally, I was affected by a recent credit breach from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

According to the data breach website, my Social Security number and personal information have been compromised by these companies. Given this information, my credit report should have been locked, and there should be no listings or open lines of credit. I have not had any credit accounts for over five years, and due to health issues, I am no longer driving, further reducing my need for credit.

Furthermore, I request the immediate detection of my credit report to prevent any unauthorized access and the removal of my information from all third-party pre-approval lists. I believe that all three credit bureaus ( XXXX, Experian, and XXXX ) should have refrained from sharing my information without my consent. 

I also request the deletion of any and all unauthorized information on my report, including but not limited to addresses, phone numbers, income, and any charge-offs. It is essential that my credit report reflects only accurate and authorized information. 

Additionally, I want to bring to your attention the recent lawsuit settled in XX/XX/year>, which held credit reporting agencies accountable for mishandling consumer data. This settlement further underscores the need for the protection of consumers ' personal information and reinforces my request for the deletion of inaccurate information from my credit report. 

Please be advised that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to request the deletion of any inaccurate or unverifiable information. Failure to comply with my request may result in a fine of up to {$1000.00} as stipulated by relevant laws.

I kindly ask that you investigate this matter and provide written confirmation of the deletion of my credit report. Please let me know if you require any additional documentation to support my request. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Dispute of Inaccurate Reporting Account # XXXX Dear Experian Dispute Department, I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate reporting of the above-referenced account on my credit report. According to your records, this account reflects a balance of {$16000.00}. However, I have documentation ( attached for reference ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that the actual deficiency balance is {$5600.00} after the repossession and sale of the collateral. This discrepancy is not only significant but is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 1681i and related consumer protection laws.

Grounds for Dispute : 1. Inaccurate Reporting ( 1681e ( b ) ) : Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy and completeness of all information reported. The discrepancy between the actual deficiency balance provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX and the amount being reported by Experian clearly demonstrates a failure to meet this requirement. 

2. Verification Requirement ( 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ) : I request that you immediately conduct an investigation into this matter and verify the accuracy of the reported balance. If the creditor can not substantiate the reported balance of {$16000.00}, this account must be corrected or deleted from my credit file.

3. Unfair and Misleading Information : Reporting an inflated balance misrepresents the true state of this account, which negatively impacts my creditworthiness and violates consumer protection principles.

4. Potential Violations of FDCPA ( 807 ) : If this inaccurate balance is being communicated as an attempt to collect a debt, it may constitute a false or misleading representation under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Attached to this letter is documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX showing the correct deficiency balance, which unequivocally supports my claim.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,DE,19805,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11161446

These accounts were opened without my authorization or consent and remain reported in violation of federal laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Despite my valid identity theft report, Experian has unlawfully refused to investigate and remove these accounts, further compounding their violations. 

The accounts in question are : Accounts XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, Experian XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, Experian ) XXXX XXXX  Account : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, Experian ) XXXX XXXX Account XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, Experian ) XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX  Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, Experian ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, Experian ) XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, Experian ) XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, Experian ) Experians Unlawful Conduct Experian has responded to my dispute with an automated email falsely claiming that my identity theft report and supporting evidence are invalid, stating : "" We are responding to your request that information in your personal credit report be blocked due to identity theft. Based on our review of your request and the information available to us, we have determined that either : your request to block was made in error, or, your request to block information was based on a material misrepresentation, or, you knowingly obtained or should have known that you obtained possession of goods, services, or moneys as a result of one or more of the transactions that you are seeking to block. '' This response is both baseless and illegal. I have complied with all legal requirements, including submitting a valid identity theft affidavit. Experians refusal to block or remove these accounts violates several provisions of federal law : 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 Blocking Information Resulting from Identity Theft : Credit reporting agencies are legally required to block information stemming from identity theft upon receipt of appropriate documentation. Experian 's failure to comply directly violates this statute. 

XXXX XXXX.S.C. 1681b ( f ) Permissible Purposes for Reporting : Reporting fraudulent accounts for which I did not authorize the furnishing of data violates permissible purposes under federal law.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) Reinvestigation of Disputed Information : Experian is required to perform a reasonable reinvestigation of disputes. Refusing to investigate and relying on automated responses demonstrates clear noncompliance.

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports : Experian is obligated to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the data they report. Allowing fraudulent accounts to remain on my credit report violates this provision.

15 U.S.C. 1681n Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : Experians refusal to address valid disputes constitutes willful noncompliance, making them liable for civil damages.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information : The entities reporting these fraudulent accounts have also failed in their legal duty to provide accurate and verified information. 

Conclusion Experians ongoing failure to comply with federal law and their reliance on automated denials are unacceptable and unlawful. I urge the CFPB to investigate Experians conduct and hold them accountable for their violations of the FCRA.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am writing to lodge a formal complaint and request an investigation regarding a charged-off account, ACCOUNT NAME : ACHIEVEPL, ACCOUNT # : XXXX inaccurately reported by a creditor. Specifically, the creditor has unlawfully reported a charged-off account while simultaneously reflecting a balance on my credit report. This reporting practice violates my rights under federal law, including the Internal Revenue Code ( Title 26 ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Furthermore, I have not received a 1099-C from the creditor, which is required when debt is canceled, discharged, or otherwise written off. 

B

asis for Complaint Failure to Issue 1099-C as Required by IRC 6050P Under the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC 6050P ), a creditor is obligated to issue a Form 1099-C when a debt of {$600.00} or more is canceled or charged off. The absence of a 1099-C creates ambiguity about the legal status of the account. It is a clear indication of noncompliance with federal tax reporting requirements and calls into question the validity of the continued reporting of any balance. Inconsistent Reporting of a Charged-Off Account By reporting the account as "" charged-off '' while still reflecting a balance, the creditor is engaging in inconsistent and inaccurate reporting. A "" charge-off '' designation signifies that the creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible and ceased collection activities. Therefore, any balance reported is misleading and violates the accuracy standards required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). 

Court Precedent : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the court held that once a debt is charged off, it can not simultaneously remain active for reporting purposes or accrue interest. This precedent underscores that reporting a charged-off debt with a balance constitutes a misrepresentation of the debt 's legal status and harms the consumers creditworthiness. 

Violations of Law IRC 6050P requires creditors to issue a Form 1099-C for debts deemed canceled, charged-off, or discharged. The failure to comply violates federal tax law. 

FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) mandates that information furnished to credit reporting agencies must be accurate and not misleading. The continued reporting of a balance on a charged-off account is inconsistent, inaccurate, and unlawful. 

Requested Actions I respectfully request that the CFPB : Investigate the creditors noncompliance with IRC 6050P, particularly the failure to issue a Form 1099-C ; Require the creditor to clarify the legal status of the charged-off account and correct any inaccurate reporting ; Direct the creditor and credit reporting agencies to remove the charged-off account and balance from my credit report ; Enforce compliance with the FCRA and federal tax laws to prevent further violations of my rights. 

Supporting Documentation I have attached all supporting documentation, including account statements and any relevant correspondence, to substantiate my complaint. 

Conclusion The inaccurate reporting of a charged-off account with an outstanding balance violates federal law and my rights as a consumer. The absence of a 1099-C further demonstrates the creditors failure to adhere to legal requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. I urge the CFPB to investigate this matter promptly and take all necessary actions to ensure compliance with federal law.

Nonetheless, The representative advised that my XXXX payment would be skipped and that this would not affect my credit. Mind you, I have never been late with my car payment at all during my relationship with JPMorgan Chase. The representative asked when I would make my XXXX car payment, and I had indicated on XXXX when it was due. He further explained that this would be a new month and would be standard payment procedure. Well come to find out, They did not approve my payment deferment because I was not able to make my car payment on XX/XX/XXXX. They provided no communication stating that I was denied and the details of being denied was not detailed in the agreement that I signed. In addition, I was under the impression that if I make my payment within the 10 day grace period that I would still be ok. I contacted the escalation department and spoke to them about my grievances with their procedures and how it was a switch and bait. Due to their illogical business process ... my credit has been adversely affected, and this is not fair. Like, I stated previously I have never been late on my car payment. i trusted them that they would follow through on their plan. they tricked me and now my credit has dropped more than XXXX points. I am in the process of purchasing a home and now I will definitely not be able to close because of this hiccup. I ask they they correct the negative reporting to the credit bureaus and that they approve my request for deferrment as soon as possible.

They are like a XXXX organization that just played a trick on their client for what gain? I am not sure but I am collateral damage. I think this new administration needs to regulate companies like this with these arbitrary policies that benefit no one.

My account was closed due to loads, a term that Chime has failed to explain, despite multiple conversations with their customer support team. During these conversations, I was never provided a clear definition of loads or any explanation for why this term was used to justify closing my account. The account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. 


As a result, I have been left with {$1900.00} in my secured credit builder account and only {$12.00} in my checking account. Chime informed me that I had violated the deposit agreement policy, but I am not aware of any such violation. All of my deposits have come from three fully verified sources : XXXX. XXXX, which is my direct deposit from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX . 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX, where my account is linked, and I have withdrawn legal funds. 

XXXX. XXXX, a fully verified sports betting account, from which I can provide records of every withdrawal.

Despite the fact that all of my deposits are legitimate and verified, I have been told that I will never be able to access my funds. This has caused significant inconvenience, as I have been unable to pay critical bills, including rent, car insurance, and phone bills.

I request that Chime provide a clear explanation of the reason for closing my account and that they promptly return my funds. I would also appreciate clarification regarding the loads and the alleged violation of the deposit agreement policy.

Supporting Documents : Copies of deposit records from XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX. 

Any correspondence from Chime regarding the closure of my account.

2024-12-15,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","My mortgage servicer for my FHA loan is Carrington and I feel that they are not giving me a chance to be considered for homeowner assistance programs and are pushing me into foreclosure. I have gone through several difficult situations, but am now on my feet with a new job and additional income sources and want to try and work things out. The problem is that they are telling me the only option is to reinstate the past due balance in full, while they are having a foreclosure attorney contact me. I am very frustrated and concerned with the way they have handled the servicing of my mortgage loan. I had some major issues due to loss of employment, fire and injury that put me on workmens compensation. I have tried to communicate with Carrington and I got an email that said XXXX is reviewing my application, but I have not sent any application in. When I call to follow up I get conflicting information and it sounds like this is a delay tactic because now I am in the foreclosure system at Carrington. I thought there were programs that could help someone in my situation save their home. It sounds like Carrington has moved past that part of the program and instead started trying to auction off my home. I am back on my feet financially and can make things right if Carrington were to allow access to government programs they are supposed to offer. 

This home was owned by my parents since XXXX. When they passed away I bought the house with a loan from XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. I refinanced with XXXX in XXXX and got some cash out to get caught up on bills. I have worked as a truck driver for 30 years and it is a business with a lot of ups and downs and I was never able to save very much money. In fall of XXXX my ex-girlfriend was going to move several hours away and take our XXXX XXXX XXXX daughter with her. My daughter did not want to go and I desperately tried to come up with a plan so she could stay close to me and her grandparents. I put together the money I had and bought an RV and a space at an RV park and my daughter and I stayed there while I commuted to work and my primary residence. This lasted a few months and put me into a tough place financially and I defaulted on the loan. I contacted XXXX  and they worked with me and put me into a HUD program to put the past due payments into a second XXXX so I could resume making the regular mortgage payments. I was able to make the first couple of payments as my daughter had moved in with her grandparents but I was still in a lease for the RV Park and then my work truck caught on fire and it was a crazy situation and while I was trying to put the fire out I seriously injured my shoulder. This put me out of work. Due to all of these problems I fell behind on the mortgage payment again and was on workmens compensation for a couple of months. 

When I fell behind after getting the help in XXXX the loan had transferred to Carrington. When I ran into all of these problems I contacted them to tell them what was going on. I was told that I would need to reinstate the full past due amount and that I was going into foreclosure. I could not believe that Carrington was sending my case to XXXX XXXX XXXX.",,"CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC",ID,832XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11160765

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I am filing this formal complaint against XXXX for their failure to comply with federal laws governing consumer privacy and disclosure rights. XXXX has violated my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and other applicable statutes by : 1. Failing to Provide Required Disclosures : XXXX did not provide me with any disclosures or notifications regarding my rights to opt out of the sharing of my personal information with third parties. 
2. Failure to Honor My Opt-Out Request : I recently sent XXXX a XXXX opt-out notice, as permitted under 12 CFR 1016.7 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( i ) and 15 USC 6802, requesting that they immediately cease the disclosure of my personal information. Despite this, XXXX has continued to share my information without my authorization, directly violating my federally protected consumer rights. 
Details of the Violations : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681, Section 602 ( a ), it is stated : There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. 
XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion are consumer reporting agencies, and I am the consumer. I have the right to ensure my private information is not shared without my consent. 
This right is further supported by 15 U.S.C. 6801, which declares : It is the policy of Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information.

A furnisher of information to credit agencies qualifies as a financial institution under this definition.

Per 15 U.S.C. 1681, Section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) : A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. 
Neither XXXX ( the furnisher of information ) nor the consumer reporting agenciesXXXX XXXX, or TransUnionhave my consent, written or otherwise, to furnish or report my information. Any prior consent, whether verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or otherwise, is hereby revoked. 
Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ) - ( c ) states : A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise the nondisclosure option.

I was never informed of my right to exercise this option, which constitutes a failure to comply with the law.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ), it is stated : A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

Moreover, 15 U.S.C. 1681e requires that consumer reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with 1681c and limit the furnishing of consumer reports to authorized purposes under 1681b. XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion have failed to meet this requirement in their handling of my information. 
Lastly, 12 C.F.R. 1016.7 explicitly states : A consumer may exercise the right to opt-out at any time.

I am exercising my right to opt out of all reporting services provided by XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion. 
Requested Resolution : 1. I request the immediate removal of all unauthorized and inaccurate information reported by XXXX from my credit files with XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion. 
2. I demand that XXXX cease all reporting of my personal information and comply fully with my opt-out request. 
3. I request compensation in the maximum allowable amount of {$1000.00} for these violations, as provided under the FCRA and Privacy Act of 1974. 
Impact on Me as a Consumer : XXXX actions have violated my trust, compromised my privacy, and caused undue stress. Their failure to comply with federal laws governing the accuracy, privacy, and proper handling of consumer information has further damaged my ability to ensure my credit file reflects accurate and lawful information. 
I trust the CFPB will investigate XXXX violations and hold them accountable for failing to respect my federally protected consumer rights.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",IL,60617,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11154147

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 when a consumer submits an identity theft report, credit reporting agencies must block any information identified by the consumer as resulting from identity theft within four business days. Despite my previous correspondence Letter 1 and Letter 2, which requested the removal of the above-mentioned account due to inaccuracies and failure to validate the information as required by law, Transunion has not conducted a proper investigation nor provided the required documentation. Reasons for Complaint : 1. Violation of the FCRA : o Investigation Requirements ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) : Your verification response did not include a sufficient description of the investigation process, as required by the FCRA. You failed to adhere to the obligation to provide a thorough and detailed account of the steps taken to verify the information. o Permissible Purposes ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( 2 ) ) : The information provided did not comply with the permissible purposes outlined in the FCRA. The verification process failed to meet the established standards for handling and reporting information. o Privacy Rights ( 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( 4 ) ) : The continued inclusion of this bankruptcy record and associated accounts infringes upon my privacy rights. The failure to follow appropriate procedures for handling sensitive information constitutes a violation of this section. o Description of Investigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 7 ) ) : Credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a dispute. To date, I have not received this required information. o Invocation of 15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) and 15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 2 ) : I am invoking these provisions to request the removal of this account and to demand proof of its verification. The failure to complete this verification constitutes an abuse of my rights. 2. Violation of the TILA : o Disclosure Requirements : experian failed to provide accurate and timely disclosures regarding the account status, breaching the TILA requirements. 3. Federal Consumer Protections : o Title 15, Chapter 41 : The failure to provide adequate proof and the apparent disregard for my rights under the FCRA indicate a violation of federal consumer protection laws. o Public Law 91-506, Title VI, Section 611, Subsections A-D : This law stipulates the procedures for the removal of inaccurate or incomplete information from credit reports. The response and verification process did not comply with these provisions, necessitating the removal of the bankruptcy record.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"This complaint is being filed against XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion for failure to comply with federal laws governing the reporting and timely removal of inaccurate accounts associated with identity theft. 

I have previously submitted an Identity Theft Affidavit, an Affidavit of Truth, and copies of my identifying information to each of the credit bureaus via certified mail, which has been received as evidenced by the return receipts. These documents clearly establish that the following accounts are fraudulent and must be deleted immediately : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I stated Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x ), you are required to investigate and delete any information that can not be verified as accurate within 4 business days when identity theft has been properly reported. Specifically : 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 mandates that credit reporting agencies block fraudulent information within 4 days of receiving an identity theft report and proof of identity.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) requires the deletion of inaccurate or unverifiable information following a reasonable investigation.

Failure to comply with these obligations has been adjudicated in the following court cases, which highlight your liability and lack of compliance : XXXX v.

According to my credit report, XXXX XXXX has listed certain accounts as charged off. However, I have concrete documentation proving that these loans are not in default, and this claim is false. This misinformation has caused undue harm to my credit score and is a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Ohio state laws. 

Details of the Disputed Accounts : Creditor : XXXX XXXX Account Number ( s ) : n/a Reported Status : Charged Off Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Additionally, in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ), the courts reinforced the obligation of credit reporting agencies to conduct reasonable investigations when a consumer disputes the accuracy of information. Reporting a charge-off inaccurately violates this precedent and further illustrates a failure to uphold proper investigative standards.

2. Documentation proving that my XXXX XXXX loans are not in default. 
3.

Specifically, 1. Current Balance : XXXX does not report a balance, while TransUnion and XXXX list {$0.00}. This inconsistency creates confusion, as all agencies should show the same balance. 
2. Date Last Active : XXXX reports the last active date as XX/XX/XXXX, which appears to be an error since it is a future date. 
TransUnion shows XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX lists XX/XX/XXXX. This discrepancy should be investigated. 
3. Date of Last Payment : XXXX lists the date as XX/XX/XXXX, while TransUnion and XXXX report XX/XX/XXXX. The difference of a few days could be an error if the payments were made simultaneously. 
4. Payment Status : TransUnion states that the account was 60 days past due. 
XXXX mentions the account was past due 30 days two or three times. 
XXXX says "" not more than three payments past due ''. These descriptions do not match and should be consistent.

5. Account Comments : XXXX specifies "" Account Closed by Credit Grantor '', while TransUnion says "" Canceled by Credit Grantor ''. Although similar, the wording differs, which could create confusion.

6. Last Reported Date : XXXX lists the reported date as XX/XX/XXXX, which appears incorrect since it is a future date. TransUnion and XXXX show XX/XX/XXXX, which seems more accurate. 
7. Credit Limit : All credit bureaus correctly report a credit limit of {$500.00}, so no error is present here.

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 USC 16811 ( 7 ) credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. Additionally, under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 USC 1601, it is imperative that all credit information provided is accurate and transparent to protect consumer rights As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccuracies in my credit report. I request that you conduct a more thorough investigation into this matter, particularly considering the following points : 1. Inconsistencies : There are discrepancies among the three credit bureaus regarding this account, including [ list specific inconsistencies ].

2. Verification Issues : According to Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the FCRA, you are required to verify accounts through original documentation. I request that you provide the supporting documentation you relied upon to verify this account.

3. Consumer Rights : Under Section 611 of the FCRA, if you can not provide adequate documentation to support the validity of this account, you must remove it from my credit report.

4. Accuracy Compliance : Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in my credit report. If the information can not be verified, per 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), I request that you delete any unverifiable information.

I believe 100 % AND THE PROOF IS ATTACH TO THIS COMPLAINT THAN the bureau has failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) in their investigation process.

Specifically, I wish MORE POINT AND VIOLATION HAVE THE TRANSUNION TO MY RIGHT AFTER THE INVESTIGATION THE ACCOUNT HAVE DISCREPACIES AND INNACURATE : 1. Failure to Investigate Accurately ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) : After submitting a dispute regarding inaccuracies on my credit report, I did not receive a thorough investigation within the mandated 30-day timeframe. The results of the investigation did not adequately address my concerns.

2. Inadequate Compliance Procedures ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ) : The bureau has not demonstrated that it has implemented reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided on my report. I am requesting detailed information on the procedures used during the investigation.

3. Duties of Furnishers of Information ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ) : The furnishers of the disputed information did not adequately investigate or rectify the inaccuracies after being notified of my dispute, as required by law.

4. Transparency and Accuracy ( TILA, 15 USC 1601 ) : The information provided in my credit report has not been accurate or transparent, violating my consumer rights.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 when a consumer submits an identity theft report, credit reporting agencies must block any information identified by the consumer as resulting from identity theft within four business days. Despite my previous correspondence Letter 1 and Letter 2, which requested the removal of the above-mentioned account due to inaccuracies and failure to validate the information as required by law, TRANSUNION has not conducted a proper investigation nor provided the required documentation. Reasons for Complaint : 1. Violation of the FCRA : o Investigation Requirements ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) : Your verification response did not include a sufficient description of the investigation process, as required by the FCRA. You failed to adhere to the obligation to provide a thorough and detailed account of the steps taken to verify the information. o Permissible Purposes ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( 2 ) ) : The information provided did not comply with the permissible purposes outlined in the FCRA. The verification process failed to meet the established standards for handling and reporting information. o Privacy Rights ( 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( 4 ) ) : The continued inclusion of this bankruptcy record and associated accounts infringes upon my privacy rights. The failure to follow appropriate procedures for handling sensitive information constitutes a violation of this section. o Description of Investigation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 7 ) ) : Credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a dispute. To date, I have not received this required information. o Invocation of 15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) and 15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 2 ) : I am invoking these provisions to request the removal of this account and to demand proof of its verification. The failure to complete this verification constitutes an abuse of my rights. 2. Violation of the TILA : o Disclosure Requirements : TRANSUNION failed to provide accurate and timely disclosures regarding the account status, breaching the TILA requirements. 3. Federal Consumer Protections : o Title 15, Chapter 41 : The failure to provide adequate proof and the apparent disregard for my rights under the FCRA indicate a violation of federal consumer protection laws. o Public Law 91-506, Title VI, Section 611, Subsections A-D : This law stipulates the procedures for the removal of inaccurate or incomplete information from credit reports. The response and verification process did not comply with these provisions, necessitating the removal of the bankruptcy record.

Specifically, 1. Current Balance : XXXX does not report a balance, while TransUnion and XXXX list {$0.00}. This inconsistency creates confusion, as all agencies should show the same balance. 
2. Date Last Active : XXXX reports the last active date as XX/XX/XXXX, which appears to be an error since it is a future date. 
TransUnion shows XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX lists XX/XX/XXXX. This discrepancy should be investigated. 
3. Date of Last Payment : XXXX lists the date as XX/XX/XXXX, while TransUnion and XXXX report XX/XX/XXXX. The difference of a few days could be an error if the payments were made simultaneously. 
4. Payment Status : TransUnion states that the account was 60 days past due. 
XXXX mentions the account was past due 30 days two or three times. 
XXXX says "" not more than three payments past due ''. These descriptions do not match and should be consistent.

5. Account Comments : XXXX specifies "" Account Closed by Credit Grantor '', while TransUnion says "" Canceled by Credit Grantor ''. Although similar, the wording differs, which could create confusion.

6. Last Reported Date : XXXX lists the reported date as XX/XX/XXXX, which appears incorrect since it is a future date. TransUnion and XXXX show XX/XX/XXXX, which seems more accurate. 
7. Credit Limit : All credit bureaus correctly report a credit limit of {$500.00}, so no error is present here.

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 USC 16811 ( 7 ) credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. Additionally, under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 USC 1601, it is imperative that all credit information provided is accurate and transparent to protect consumer rights As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccuracies in my credit report. I request that you conduct a more thorough investigation into this matter, particularly considering the following points : 1. Inconsistencies : There are discrepancies among the three credit bureaus regarding this account, including [ list specific inconsistencies ].

2. Verification Issues : According to Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the FCRA, you are required to verify accounts through original documentation. I request that you provide the supporting documentation you relied upon to verify this account.

3. Consumer Rights : Under Section 611 of the FCRA, if you can not provide adequate documentation to support the validity of this account, you must remove it from my credit report.

4. Accuracy Compliance : Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in my credit report. If the information can not be verified, per 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), I request that you delete any unverifiable information.

I believe 100 % AND THE PROOF IS ATTACH TO THIS COMPLAINT THAN the bureau has failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) in their investigation process.

Specifically, I wish MORE POINT AND VIOLATION HAVE THE TRANSUNION TO MY RIGHT AFTER THE INVESTIGATION THE ACCOUNT HAVE DISCREPACIES AND INNACURATE : 1. Failure to Investigate Accurately ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) : After submitting a dispute regarding inaccuracies on my credit report, I did not receive a thorough investigation within the mandated 30-day timeframe. The results of the investigation did not adequately address my concerns.

2. Inadequate Compliance Procedures ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ) : The bureau has not demonstrated that it has implemented reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided on my report. I am requesting detailed information on the procedures used during the investigation.

3. Duties of Furnishers of Information ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ) : The furnishers of the disputed information did not adequately investigate or rectify the inaccuracies after being notified of my dispute, as required by law.

4. Transparency and Accuracy ( TILA, 15 USC 1601 ) : The information provided in my credit report has not been accurate or transparent, violating my consumer rights.

5. Public Law 91-506, Title VI, Section 611, Subsections A-D : This law stipulates the procedures for the removal of inaccurate or incomplete information from credit reports.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I was taken advantage of due to malpractice while your company broke several laws under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I recently did an investigation on my credit report and I found invalidated, inaccurate, unverifiable, and questionable items that your company is reporting. Your agency is not reporting 100 % correct information. Under 15 U.S. code 1681e ( b ) ( b ) Accuracy of report whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual to whom the report relates. For the past two months I've tried to settle this issue with your company via mail however, I have reasonable evidence that your company is only trying to make times harder on me at the moment by not following reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy. 15 USC 1681b ( 2 ) Permissible purposes of consumer reports also validate that anything reporting on my credit report that I did not consent to is fraud. I DID NOT give written or oral consent to any company listed below to disclose any of my nonpublic personal information. As of XX/XX/XXXX I've notified each company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) that I am using my right to opt out of their reporting on my consumer report. I have a right to privacy and per the Privacy Act of 1974 as a federally protected consumer, I am now revoking any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non-written, verbal, and non-verbal per 5 USC 552a. Per the FCRA as a federally protected consumer I am now opting out of any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non-written, verbal, and non-verbal per 15 USC 6802. I shall also point out their responsibility pursuant to 15 USC section 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( ii ) : ( a ) RESPONSIBILITIES OF FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES. A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. Your agency along with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is in violation of multiple laws set forth by XXXX in regard to the following individual accounts of the consumer ( myself ). 15 USC 1681a ( 2 ) ( a ) ( I ) states that the consumer report does not include information solely as to transactions or experiences ( payment history, charge-off status ), between the consumer ( myself ) and the creditor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer ( me ) to any consumer reporting agency ( XXXX, TRANSUNION ) if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX can NOT collect on a discharged debt. These accounts are now considered certificates of indebtedness per the IRS, and income can NOT be reported on a consumer report. The IRS clearly defines a charge-off as gross or ordinary income, INCOME DOES NOT GET REPORTED ON THE CONSUMER REPORT which in fact makes the reporting of these accounts inaccurate! I provided a screenshot from the IRS website. By definition, the IRS clearly says a canceled debt or charge-off is income. The reporting of these accounts are inaccurate. To further validate that these accounts have been charged-off by each company with the IRS, I received a copy B of each company 's XXXX filing with the IRS and I've attached each copy as evidence. According to my consumer report and the XXXX filings with the IRS by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  each company has received a profit loss tax write off as a benefit of reporting debts greater than {$600.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has obviously written the debt off with the IRS so they should no longer be reporting these accounts on my consumer report, by doing so they're committing tax fraud. They've already filed the required forms with the IRS to notify them that they've took a profit loss, yet these accounts are still reporting these accounts on my consumer report. Maybe XXXX and TRANSUNION XXXX think XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  hasn't actually written off the debt attached to the accounts. If that is the case per 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( ii ) these accounts are inaccurately reporting and should be removed immediately. According to my XXXX credit file on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX removed the same accounts that XXXX and TRANSUNION are currently reporting XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have attached a copy of the credit report from XXXX that shows the account has been removed. I request that you immediately remove these account from my credit report. Pursuant to 15 USC 6802 ( 1 ) ( c ) companies must not disclose any of my personal information unless I was given an explanation on how I can exercise a non-disclosure option, I am supposed to be notified of my eligibility to opt-out every thirty days. 16 CFR 313.7 ( f ) states there is a continuing right to opt-out, and a consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time. I've never been notified that I'm eligible to opt out. This is a violation of 15 USC 6802. Obligations with respect respect to disclosure of personal information.

This account contains multiple discrepancies and ambiguities across all three credit reporting agencies XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion which clearly violate reasonable verification procedures required under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ). 

Specific Discrepancies and Ambiguities : Status Inconsistency : XXXX lists the account as "" Charge-Off '' with the last payment as XX/XX/year>. 
XXXX states the "" Account Charged Off '' with a date discrepancy ( XX/XX/year> ) and marks a consumer dispute unresolved. 
TransUnion reports "" Charged Off as Bad Debt '' with an unclear payment history. 
These inconsistencies indicate an inadequate investigation and verification process, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). 
Ambiguous Payment History : Each bureau provides differing dates of delinquency and "" charge-off '' status reporting, which contradict the accurate timeline. 
No payment history is displayed on TransUnion 's report, violating 1681e ( b ) regarding the accuracy of all data presented.

Verification Procedures : I demand the bureau disclose the reasonable procedures used to verify this account, as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). Failure to disclose such procedures violates my consumer rights. 
Consumer Statement and Dispute Status : XXXX mentions "" Item in Dispute by Consumer '', yet it remains unresolved. This violates your duty under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) to investigate disputes promptly and mark accounts as accurate only after proper validation. 
Violations of Law Identified : FCRA Violations : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Failure to maintain and follow reasonable procedures for maximum possible accuracy. 
15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) : Failure to reinvestigate disputed items and correct or delete inaccurate information.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : Failure of the furnisher to conduct a thorough investigation after being notified of a dispute.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) Violations : 15 U.S.C. 6802 : Non-consensual sharing of inaccurate data with credit bureaus.

15 U.S.C. 6804 : The bureaus failure to safeguard the integrity of consumer data during reporting. 
Recent Data Breaches Impacting Consumer Trust : Given the National Consumer Protection Database ( NPD ) breach, I question the validity of verification procedures for my personal data. This further necessitates proof that accurate records exist and were verified securely. 
Relief Sought : Immediate Deletion : I request that this account be permanently deleted from my credit file if your investigation can not prove its absolute accuracy. 
Procedural Documentation : Provide documentation of the methods used to verify this information. 
Cease Reporting : Stop reporting this account until your procedures are brought into compliance. 
Failure to address this dispute within 30 days will result in further actions, including a formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and pursuing legal remedies.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate, misleading, and potentially unlawful reporting regarding my XXXX XXXX  account that is being furnished to XXXX Transunion in XXXX Upon reviewing my credit report, I have identified **multiple violations and inconsistencies** under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which require immediate correction. Identified Violations and Inaccuracies 1. **Reporting Incorrect Status with Past Due Balance and Charge-Off** : - The report reflects that the account has been charged off and closed. However, it simultaneously lists a **past due amount** of ** $ XXXX as of XXXX XXXX. - A charged-off account indicates that the creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible. Per FCRA guidelines, any charged-off balance can not remain reported as past due, as this misrepresents the current status of the debt. XXXX. **Future-Dated Entries** : - The report reflects contradictory **future dates** ( e.g., Status Updated : XX/XX/year>, Balance Updated : XX/XX/year> ). These dates are impossible because this report was generated in XXXX XXXX. Reporting future activity is inaccurate, misleading, and violates the FCRAs requirement for fair and accurate reporting. XXXX. **Credit Usage at 118 % ** : - The report states that my credit usage is XXXX*118 % **, which is mathematically incorrect because the credit limit is reported as ** $ XXXX while the current balance is ** $ XXXX. This reflects inaccuracies in balance calculation or credit usage reporting. XXXX. **Ambiguity in Comments and Dispute Resolution** : - The comments indicate the account was previously in dispute investigation complete. However, no documentation or outcome of the investigation was provided to me, violating my right to a proper investigation under FCRA Section 611. 5. **Multiple Reporting Violations** : - **Incorrect Balance Reporting** : The balance and credit usage appear overstated. - **Duplicate Reporting** : The account balance and past due amount seem to be inconsistently reported across sections. Additional Violations in Payment History Reporting 1. **Future-Dated Late Payments** : - The payment history shows **late payments for XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and XXXX XXXX. As of todays date in XX/XX/year>, these months have not yet occurred, and future payments can not be accurately reported as late. This constitutes **false and inaccurate reporting** and is a clear violation of FCRA Section 607 ( b ), which mandates maximum possible accuracy. 2. **Inconsistent Reporting with Past Account Status** : - The account has already been charged off and closed as reflected earlier in the report. A charged-off account should not reflect **ongoing monthly late payments**, as the creditor is no longer expecting regular payments. Reporting multiple late payments after the charge-off date is both redundant and misleading. 3. **Adverse Impact on Creditworthiness** : - These inaccuracies in payment history significantly harm my creditworthiness by misrepresenting my financial behavior and account status. Legal Basis for Dispute Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : - **Section 611** requires that disputed information must be investigated and corrected within 30 days. - **Section 607 ( b ) ** requires maximum possible accuracy of information furnished. - **Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ** prohibits furnishers from reporting inaccurate or unverifiable information. - **Section 605 ( a ) ( 5 ) ** prohibits re-aging or reporting obsolete information. The inaccuracies on this report violate these provisions and misrepresent my creditworthiness, causing harm. Requested Action I demand the following : 1. **Immediate investigation** into the inaccurate reporting under FCRA guidelines . 2. **Removal of the account and of the following : - The past due status and amount, as the account is charged off. - Any future-dated entries, as they are impossible and misleading. - The overstated credit usage percentage and balance inconsistencies. - Inaccurate payment history reporting for future months and redundant late payments post-charge-off. 3. **Documentation** of the investigation results and verification of all corrected information. Failure to Comply If you fail to address these inaccuracies within the 30-day timeframe required by law, I will escalate this matter with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX CFPB ) and explore all available legal remedies under the FCRA. I have enclosed a copy of the credit report, including the **payment history**, for your reference.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Subject : Dispute of Incorrect Information on Credit Report To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute inaccuracies on my credit report. These errors, as furnished by the creditors listed below, violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am requesting the CFPBs assistance to ensure these matters are thoroughly investigated and that the information is corrected or removed if it can not be substantiated. 

Disputed Accounts and Issues 1. XXXX  XXXX ( Account XXXX. XXXX ) Issue : The account is reported as a charge-off with {$460.00} written off and past due as of XX/XX/XXXX. These details appear inconsistent with my payment history and balance updates. 

Request : Verify the payment history, balance, and charge-off status. Remove or correct any discrepancies if substantiation is lacking. 

XXXX. XXXX ( Account XXXX. XXXX ) Issue : The account is listed as repossessed with an {$8100.00} balance past due. However, the payment history and status updates are unclear and inconsistent with my records. 

On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I was involved in a severe car accident while completing a XXXX delivery. The vehicle was rear-ended, causing serious neck and back injuries that left me unable to work or generate income. The car remained at the repair facility for approximately XXXX months while the at-fault partys insurance processed the claim and handled repairs. 

During this time, I contacted XXXX Customer Service to explain my situation and request assistance due to these extenuating circumstances. Despite my efforts to keep them informed, XXXX attempted to repossess the vehicle from the repair facility. I managed to make a payment to delay the repossession temporarily, but the vehicle was ultimately repossessed in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Request : XXXX. Validate the reported payment history, repossession status, and balance. 

XXXX. Provide documentation detailing the accounts payment history, repossession procedures, and any charges or balances resulting from the repossession. 

XXXX. Remove or correct any inaccuracies or unverifiable information in compliance with the FCRA. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) Issue : The account reflects a past due balance of {$80.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX, alongside delinquencies that do not align with my records. 

Request : Investigate and verify the reported payment history and past due amounts. Remove unverifiable information. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account No. XXXX ) Issue : The account is listed as charged-off with {$220.00} past due. However, prior dispute attempts have not resolved discrepancies in the payment history or charge-off details. 

Request : Reinvestigate and correct any errors in the charge-off or payment records. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account No. XXXX ) Issue : The account is inaccurately listed as a charge-off. Additionally, I have never signed an agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX. My original contract was with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and there is no documentation proving my obligation to XXXX. 

Request : 1. Confirm the accuracy of the charge-off status, payment history, and balance.

2. Remove unverifiable information, as required under : 15 USC 1666b : Billing error correction.

15 USC 1681i : Credit reporting dispute requirements.

15 USC 1681s-2 : Obligations of furnishers to report accurate data.

UCC 9, Part 6 : Repossession compliance.

Summary of Concerns Many of these accounts reference prior disputes that failed to produce conclusive evidence or rectifications. The inaccuracies harm my credit profile and fail to meet the FCRAs requirements for accurate, complete, and verifiable reporting.

Requested Actions 1. Ensure each disputed account is thoroughly reinvestigated.

2. Remove or correct any unverifiable or inaccurate information.

3. Require furnishers to provide documentation supporting their reporting or correct the records as necessary.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please keep me updated on the progress of your investigation and any actions taken to resolve these disputes.

I. INACCURATE REPORTING Late Payments on Charged-Off Accounts : It is widely established that once an account is charged off, reporting additional late payments is not permissible. Despite this, the aforementioned creditors have continued to report late payments after charging off the accounts. This practice is both inaccurate and misleading.

Violation : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies must ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information included in consumer reports. 

Permissible Purpose : I do not give written consent for XXXX, XXXX, or TransUnion to report these accounts or my personal information further. The reporting of these accounts without my consent constitutes an additional violation of the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which restricts the circumstances under which consumer information may be disclosed.

II. FAILURE TO RESPOND TO DISPUTES I have previously disputed these accounts, and the credit reporting agencies failed to respond within the required 30-day period as stipulated by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). This non-compliance places your agencies in direct violation of the FCRA.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) TransUnion LLC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX Re : Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Failure to Remove Unauthorized Accounts To Whom It May Concern, This letter serves as my final formal notice to TransUnion regarding your repeated failure to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), codified at 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., and federal law protecting consumer rights. Despite my multiple submissions of the FTC Fraud Affidavit, drivers license, and proof of address in accordance with 605 ( b ), you have failed to delete the unauthorized accounts and fraudulent information from my consumer report. XXXX and XXXX have already complied with my demands and removed the following unauthorized accounts : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Your ongoing refusal to remove these accounts constitutes willful non-compliance with your statutory obligations and reflects a pattern of negligence that is unlawful and injurious. 
Violations of Federal Law 1. 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Failure to Maintain Reasonable Procedures for Accuracy Under this section, TransUnion is required to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information on a consumers report. Your continued reporting of unauthorized accountsdespite receiving sufficient documentationdemonstrates a violation of this duty. The Supreme Court case TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) affirmed that TransUnion had failed to follow reasonable procedures, resulting in demonstrable harm to consumers. You are repeating these same violations in my case. 
2. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) Failure to Conduct a Proper Reinvestigation TransUnion has received multiple dispute notices from me, yet you have failed to reinvestigate and remove clearly unauthorized accounts. Federal law mandates that reinvestigations must be reasonable and completed within 30 days. Your failure to act is a blatant disregard of this provision. 
3. 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) Permissible Purpose Continuing to report and disseminate unauthorized accounts to third parties without my consent or a permissible purpose under the law constitutes a violation of 1681b ( a ). Your actions are an unlawful invasion of my privacy and have caused direct harm to my financial standing. 
4. 15 U.S.C. 1681g Failure to Provide Accurate File Disclosure You have also failed to provide a proper explanation or resolution to my dispute, which violates your duty under this section to provide consumers with accurate file information and a clear statement of their rights under the FCRA. 
5. Fraudulent Intent & Constitutional Violations Your repeated refusal to correct the inaccuracies, despite overwhelming documentation, suggests a pattern of fraudulent intent to harm my financial standing. By holding unauthorized information against my will, you are violating my Fifth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection under the law. 
TransUnions Established History of Non-Compliance Your actions mirror TransUnions long-standing history of violating the FCRA, as evidenced in legal cases such as : TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez ( XXXX ) Highlighted TransUnions failure to follow reasonable procedures, resulting in harm to thousands of consumers. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) TransUnion was held accountable for failing to ensure accuracy in its reports, particularly regarding public record information. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Demonstrated negligence in handling reinvestigations and ensuring compliance with the FCRA. 
These cases illustrate TransUnions repeated disregard for federal law, and your actions against me are no different. 
Demand for Immediate Action In accordance with federal law, I demand that TransUnion immediately and permanently delete the following unauthorized accounts from my consumer report : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to comply will leave me no choice but to : 1. File a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). 
2. Pursue civil action under 15 U.S.C. 1681n for willful non-compliance and damages, including statutory penalties of {$1000.00} per violation, actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees. 
3. Hold your back-office leadership personally accountable for their failure to comply with federal law under XXXX statutes for fraudulent and intentional misrepresentation of information. 
Conclusion TransUnions refusal to follow federal law and your continued fraudulent reporting have caused undue harm to my financial well-being and peace of mind. Your conduct is not only unlawful but also deeply unethical. This letter is your final opportunity to resolve this matter before legal and regulatory actions are initiated. 
I expect written confirmation of the removal of the aforementioned accounts within 15 days of receipt of this letter.

Specifically, 1. Current Balance : XXXX does not report a balance, while TransUnion and XXXX list {$0.00}. This inconsistency creates confusion, as all agencies should show the same balance.

2. Date Last Active : XXXX reports the last active date as XX/XX/XXXX, which appears to be an error since it is a future date. 
TransUnion shows XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX lists XX/XX/XXXX. This discrepancy should be investigated. 
3. Date of Last Payment : XXXX lists the date as XX/XX/XXXX, while TransUnion and XXXX report XX/XX/XXXX. The difference of a few days could be an error if the payments were made simultaneously. 
4. Payment Status : TransUnion states that the account was 60 days past due. 
XXXX mentions the account was past due 30 days two or three times. 
XXXX says "" not more than three payments past due ''. These descriptions do not match and should be consistent.

5. Account Comments : XXXX specifies "" Account Closed by Credit Grantor '', while TransUnion says "" Canceled by Credit Grantor ''. Although similar, the wording differs, which could create confusion.

6. Last Reported Date : XXXX lists the reported date as XX/XX/XXXX, which appears incorrect since it is a future date. TransUnion and XXXX show XX/XX/XXXX, which seems more accurate.

7. Credit Limit : All credit bureaus correctly report a credit limit of {$500.00}, so no error is present here.

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 USC 16811 ( 7 ) credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. Additionally, under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 USC 1601, it is imperative that all credit information provided is accurate and transparent to protect consumer rights As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccuracies in my credit report. I request that you conduct a more thorough investigation into this matter, particularly considering the following points : 1. Inconsistencies : There are discrepancies among the three credit bureaus regarding this account, including [ list specific inconsistencies ].

2. Verification Issues : According to Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the FCRA, you are required to verify accounts through original documentation. I request that you provide the supporting documentation you relied upon to verify this account.

3. Consumer Rights : Under Section 611 of the FCRA, if you can not provide adequate documentation to support the validity of this account, you must remove it from my credit report.

4. Accuracy Compliance : Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in my credit report. If the information can not be verified, per 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), I request that you delete any unverifiable information.

I believe 100 % AND THE PROOF IS ATTACH TO THIS COMPLAINT THAN the bureau has failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) in their investigation process.

Specifically, I wish MORE POINT AND VIOLATION HAVE THE TRANSUNION TO MY RIGHT AFTER THE INVESTIGATION THE ACCOUNT HAVE DISCREPACIES AND INNACURATE : 1. Failure to Investigate Accurately ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) : After submitting a dispute regarding inaccuracies on my credit report, I did not receive a thorough investigation within the mandated 30-day timeframe. The results of the investigation did not adequately address my concerns.

2. Inadequate Compliance Procedures ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ) : The bureau has not demonstrated that it has implemented reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided on my report. I am requesting detailed information on the procedures used during the investigation.

3. Duties of Furnishers of Information ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ) : The furnishers of the disputed information did not adequately investigate or rectify the inaccuracies after being notified of my dispute, as required by law.

4. Transparency and Accuracy ( TILA, 15 USC 1601 ) : The information provided in my credit report has not been accurate or transparent, violating my consumer rights.

5. Public Law 91-506, Title VI, Section 611, Subsections A-D : This law stipulates the procedures for the removal of inaccurate or incomplete information from credit reports. Your response and verification process did not comply with these provisions, necessitating the removal of the bankruptcy record.

7. 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 7 ) - Description of Investigation : Pursuant to the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. To date, I have not received this required information.

9. 15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) - Verification Requirement : Per the FCRA, you are required by federal law to verify all accounts and public information through physical verification of the original signed consumer contract and/or judgment ( s ). Without such verification, there is a risk that erroneous or fraudulent information could be included in credit reports. Given the lack of adequate verification, I request the removal of this unauthorized public record information.

I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Transunion for their failure to comply with the FCRA and TILA. Additionally, This is a violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Removal of Inaccurate/invalidated credit information, please remove inmediately.

Dear Consumer, Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a formal complaint against TransUnion for its repeated failure to remove inaccurate account information from my credit report following two reinvestigations, which is in violation of 15 U.S. Code 16811 ( 5 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Account Information : Creditor Name : XXXX  Account Number : XXXX Date of Charge Off : XX/XX/year> Amount : {$1200.00} Despite providing clear evidence of the inaccuracies in the above-referenced account and requesting its removal from my credit report, TransUnion has failed to comply with the law and has retained the inaccurate account information.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act mandates that if a reinvestigation does not resolve a dispute, the credit bureau must delete the disputed information within five business days. The repeated failure of TransUnion to adhere to this requirement is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 16811 ( 5 ) and has caused me financial harm and distress.

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take immediate action against TransUnion for its non-compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I am seeking the immediate deletion of the inaccurate account information from my credit report and appropriate measures to ensure that TransUnion upholds its obligations under the law.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act mandates that if a reinvestigation does not resolve a dispute, the credit bureau must delete the disputed information within five business days. The repeated failure of TransUnion to adhere to this requirement is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 16811 ( 5 ) and has caused me financial harm and distress.

The accounts in question are : Accounts XXXX  Account : XXXX ( TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX  Account : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ( TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Account XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Consumer Adjustment Company Account : XXXX ( TransUnion XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX Account : XXXX ( TransUnion ) XXXX XXXX  Account : XXXX ( TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( TransUnion, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( TransUnion, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX XXXX TransUnion, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX  Unlawful Conduct XXXX has responded to my dispute with an automated email falsely claiming that my identity theft report and supporting evidence are invalid, stating : "" We are responding to your request that information in your personal credit report be blocked due to identity theft. Based on our review of your request and the information available to us, we have determined that either : your request to block was made in error, or, your request to block information was based on a material misrepresentation, or, you knowingly obtained or should have known that you obtained possession of goods, services, or moneys as a result of XXXX or more of the transactions that you are seeking to block. '' This response is both baseless and illegal. I have complied with all legal requirements, including submitting a valid identity theft affidavit. XXXX refusal to block or remove these accounts violates several provisions of federal law : 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 Blocking Information Resulting from Identity Theft : Credit reporting agencies are legally required to block information stemming from identity theft upon receipt of appropriate documentation. XXXX 's failure to comply directly violates this statute. 

15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) Permissible Purposes for Reporting : Reporting fraudulent accounts for which I did not authorize the furnishing of data violates permissible purposes under federal law.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) Reinvestigation of Disputed Information : XXXX is required to perform a reasonable reinvestigation of disputes. Refusing to investigate and relying on automated responses demonstrates clear noncompliance. 

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports : XXXX is obligated to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the data they report. Allowing fraudulent accounts to remain on my credit report violates this provision. 

15 U.S.C. 1681n Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : XXXX refusal to address valid disputes constitutes willful noncompliance, making them liable for civil damages. 

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information : The entities reporting these fraudulent accounts have also failed in their legal duty to provide accurate and verified information. 

Conclusion XXXX  ongoing failure to comply with federal law and their reliance on automated denials are unacceptable and unlawful. I urge the CFPB to investigate Experians conduct and hold them accountable for their violations of the FCRA.

1. XXXX XXXX XXXX I sent a Notice of Liability and Self-Executing Default to XXXX XXXX XXXX via certified mail on XX/XX/year>, delivered on XX/XX/year> ( Tracking Number : XXXX ). 
They were given 10 days to respond, but no response was received. Therefore, they are in default, and this account should no longer be reported. 
2. XXXX XXXX A Notice of Liability and Self-Executing Default was sent via certified mail on XX/XX/year>, and delivered on XX/XX/year> ( Tracking Number : XXXX ). 
Again, no response was received within 10 days, placing this account in default. This account should also be removed immediately. 
3. Student Loan ( Department of EducationXXXX ) I attempted to send a certified Notice of Liability and Self-Executing Default on XX/XX/year>, but the letter was returned as undeliverable on XX/XX/year>XXXX  ( Tracking Number : XXXX ). 
The address provided by the school was invalid, and I have been unable to properly serve notice. This loan contract was entered into under unconscionable terms and lacked full disclosure of its impact on credit reporting. 
Violations and Requests for Validation : I am requesting that TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX provide the following : 1. Written Express Consent : Proof that I provided written express consent to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , or the Department of EducationXXXX to report this information to the credit bureaus. 
2. Court Orders : Records showing that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , or the Department of EducationXXXX obtained a court order from a competent jurisdiction to communicate with me about these debts. 
3. GAAP Compliance : Documentation that XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , and the Department of EducationXXXX are adhering to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) in verifying the validity of these debts. 
If this information can not be provided, the accounts should be deleted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) for failure to verify their accuracy. 
Impact on My Rights : The reporting of these accounts is depriving me of my life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness by negatively impacting my credit score without proper validation. 
Requested Resolution : I request the immediate removal of these accounts from my credit reports, including a rapid rescore by all three credit bureaus. If this is not resolved within 7 days, I will begin assessing damages at {$5000.00} per day per account that remains on my report.

This account contains multiple discrepancies and ambiguities across all three credit reporting agencies XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion which clearly violate reasonable verification procedures required under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ). 

Specific Discrepancies and Ambiguities : Status Inconsistency : XXXX lists the account as "" Charge-Off '' with the last payment as XX/XX/year>. 
XXXX states the "" Account Charged Off '' with a date discrepancy ( XX/XX/year> ) and marks a consumer dispute unresolved. 
TransUnion reports "" Charged Off as Bad Debt '' with an unclear payment history. 
These inconsistencies indicate an inadequate investigation and verification process, violating 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). 
Ambiguous Payment History : Each bureau provides differing dates of delinquency and "" charge-off '' status reporting, which contradict the accurate timeline. 
No payment history is displayed on TransUnion 's report, violating 1681e ( b ) regarding the accuracy of all data presented.

Verification Procedures : I demand the bureau disclose the reasonable procedures used to verify this account, as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ). Failure to disclose such procedures violates my consumer rights. 
Consumer Statement and Dispute Status : XXXX mentions "" Item in Dispute by Consumer '', yet it remains unresolved. This violates your duty under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) to investigate disputes promptly and mark accounts as accurate only after proper validation. 
Violations of Law Identified : FCRA Violations : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Failure to maintain and follow reasonable procedures for maximum possible accuracy.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) : Failure to reinvestigate disputed items and correct or delete inaccurate information.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) : Failure of the furnisher to conduct a thorough investigation after being notified of a dispute.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) Violations : 15 U.S.C. 6802 : Non-consensual sharing of inaccurate data with credit bureaus.

15 U.S.C. 6804 : The bureaus failure to safeguard the integrity of consumer data during reporting. 
Recent Data Breaches Impacting Consumer Trust : Given the National Consumer Protection Database ( NPD ) breach, I question the validity of verification procedures for my personal data. This further necessitates proof that accurate records exist and were verified securely. 
Relief Sought : Immediate Deletion : I request that this account be permanently deleted from my credit file if your investigation can not prove its absolute accuracy. 
Procedural Documentation : Provide documentation of the methods used to verify this information. 
Cease Reporting : Stop reporting this account until your procedures are brought into compliance. 
Failure to address this dispute within 30 days will result in further actions, including a formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and pursuing legal remedies.

Upon thorough review of my credit report, I have identified discrepancies in the reporting of these accounts. To the best of my knowledge and records, I have consistently paid these accounts on time and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. 

Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ), my consumer report should not contain information solely as to transactions or experiences between myself and your company.

Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( b ), I request documentation of the reasonable procedures you have in place to ensure that periodic statements are mailed to me no later than 21 days before the payment due date. This documentation should include all information required by 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ) regarding the contents of such statements.

Reference to PAANL ( Paid As Agreed Never Late ) : The terms of our agreement have consistently been adhered to. Therefore, the account should be reported with a status of "" Paid As Agreed Never Late '' to accurately reflect my timely payments. Any deviation from this status misrepresents my financial responsibility and commitment to fulfilling my payment obligations.

Request for Proof : To validate the reporting of late payments on these accounts, I request the following : Documented proof supporting the claims of late payments, including dates, amounts, and any relevant communication.

In the absence of valid proof, I demand that these accounts be promptly updated to reflect their accurate status as "" Paid As Agreed Never Late.

Failure to adhere to this timeline will be considered a violation of the ( FCRA ).

Please treat this as a formal dispute under the ( FCRA ). If the inaccurate reporting is not corrected or a satisfactory resolution is not provided, I may escalate this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) or take legal action to ensure compliance.

They requested I submit a virtual selfie through their app of the front, left, and right sides of my face, as well as a virtual scan of the front and back of my ID. This made me extremely nervous to be submitting this online, through an app, with absolutely no human to speak to on their end to assure me my identity wouldn't be stolen somehow by doing this. When I realized this supposedly reputable trading app has absolutely no customer service department to speak with, and their virtual "" customer support '' doesn't respond either ( you just type a message and send it, and no response comes back to you ), I knew I was in trouble. Regardless, I submitted the ID requested in an effort to have my remaining funds unlocked so I could transfer them back to my savings account.

PRIVACY Title 15 U.S. Code 6801 states, It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information, and that the financial institution shall protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Synchrony Bank is a financial institution by definition in this Title, and its failure to abide by privacy laws has both harmed and inconvenienced me ( Attachments 2 through 5 ). 

I provided opt out instructions to Synchrony Bank on XX/XX/year> via the online messaging center in my accounts portal. Attachment 1 shows the opt out instruction, though Synchrony 's print feature did not print the full instruction.

I. INACCURATE REPORTING Late Payments on Charged-Off Accounts : It is widely established that once an account is charged off, reporting additional late payments is not permissible. Despite this, the aforementioned creditors have continued to report late payments after charging off the accounts. This practice is both inaccurate and misleading. 

Violation : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), credit reporting agencies must ensure the maximum possible accuracy of information included in consumer reports.

Permissible Purpose : I do not give written consent for Equifax, XXXX, or XXXX to report these accounts or my personal information further. The reporting of these accounts without my consent constitutes an additional violation of the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681b, which restricts the circumstances under which consumer information may be disclosed.

II. FAILURE TO RESPOND TO DISPUTES I have previously disputed these accounts, and the credit reporting agencies failed to respond within the required 30-day period as stipulated by 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). This non-compliance places your agencies in direct violation of the FCRA.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Equifax XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Department YOU BROKE THE LAW After several attempts to resolve this very serious issue and concern with Equifax this correspondence serves as a formal demand for Equifax to comply with its legal obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., and other applicable federal laws. As a consumer, I assert my rights under these statutes and demand that Equifax immediately cease and desist from reporting any nonpublic personal information or adverse account information without my explicit written consent. 
Legal Basis for My Demand : 1. Right to Privacy and Fair Treatment Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602 ( a ), consumer reporting agencies, including Equifax, have a statutory obligation to exercise their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumers right to privacy. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of protecting privacy in TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190 ( 2021 ), ruling that consumers have standing to challenge violations of their rights under the FCRA when their private information is used improperly. 
2. Nonpublic Personal Information Disclosure Under 15 U.S.C. 6801, Congress has declared a continuing obligation for financial institutions to protect the privacy of their customers by safeguarding nonpublic personal information. As a financial institution providing information to credit reporting agencies, Equifax must comply with these obligations. Furthermore, Safeco Insurance Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47 ( 2007 ) clarifies that willful noncompliance with FCRA provisions may result in liability. 
3. Lack of Written Consent Under 15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ), consumer reporting agencies may furnish a consumer report only with the written consent of the consumer. No such written consent exists, and any prior consent is hereby expressly revoked. FTC v. Accusearch Inc., 570 F.3d 1187 ( 10th Cir. 2009 ) supports the principle that unauthorized dissemination of consumer information constitutes a violation of federal law. 
4. Right to Opt-Out The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ) - ( c ), prohibits financial institutions from disclosing nonpublic personal information to unaffiliated third parties without informing the consumer of their right to opt out. Equifax has failed to inform me of this right, a violation underscored by 12 CFR 1016.7, which allows consumers to opt out at any time. I hereby exercise my right to opt out of all reporting services. 
5. Adverse Information Reporting Per 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ), consumer reporting agencies are prohibited from reporting adverse items of information, other than records of convictions, that are more than seven years old. The inclusion of such information without my consent is unlawful and was addressed in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330 ( 2016 ), which held that violations of procedural requirements under the FCRA can harm consumers concrete interests. 
6. Accuracy of Information Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ), entities furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies must ensure its accuracy. Equifaxs failure to verify the accuracy of information constitutes noncompliance. Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) mandates that consumer reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information reported. The lack of adherence to these requirements is actionable under Dalton v. Capital Associated Industries , Inc., 257 F.3d 409 ( 4th Cir. 2001 ).

Demands : 1. Immediate Cessation of Reporting Equifax must cease reporting any nonpublic personal information or adverse account information concerning me without my written consent, in compliance with 15 U.S.C. 1681 and 15 U.S.C. 6802.

2. Verification of Compliance Provide written confirmation of your compliance with this demand within 30 days of receipt of this letter. Failure to comply will result in legal action, including but not limited to filing complaints with federal regulatory agencies and pursuing litigation under the FCRA. 
3. Correction of Inaccurate Information Immediately investigate and remove any inaccurate or unverifiable information in my credit report in accordance with your obligations under 15 U.S.C. 1681i.

The following inaccurate and unverified information MUST be removed : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This letter constitutes my final demand for compliance. Failure to adhere to these demands will leave me no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies.

Based on our review of your request and the information available to us, we have determined that either : your request to block was made in error, or, your request to block information was based on a material misrepresentation, or, you knowingly obtained or should have known that you obtained possession of goods, services, or moneys as a result of one or more of the transactions that you are seeking to block. '' This response is both baseless and illegal. I have complied with all legal requirements, including submitting a valid identity theft affidavit. XXXX refusal to block or remove these accounts violates several provisions of federal law : 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 Blocking Information Resulting from Identity Theft : Credit reporting agencies are legally required to block information stemming from identity theft upon receipt of appropriate documentation. XXXX 's failure to comply directly violates this statute. 

15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) Permissible Purposes for Reporting : Reporting fraudulent accounts for which I did not authorize the furnishing of data violates permissible purposes under federal law.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) Reinvestigation of Disputed Information : XXXX is required to perform a reasonable reinvestigation of disputes. Refusing to investigate and relying on automated responses demonstrates clear noncompliance. 

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports : XXXX is obligated to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the data they report. Allowing fraudulent accounts and inquiries to remain on my credit report violates this provision. 

15 U.S.C. 1681n Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : XXXX refusal to address valid disputes constitutes willful noncompliance, making them liable for civil damages. 

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information : The entities reporting these fraudulent accounts have also failed in their legal duty to provide accurate and verified information.

2024-12-15,Prepaid card,Government benefit card,Unexpected or other fees,,"I am filing a formal complaint against Bank of America for their mishandling of my claim involving fraudulent and unauthorized charges to my EDD benefits account. Despite providing all required documentation to verify that I am a victim of identity theft, Bank of America has repeatedly dismissed my claim without conducting a proper investigation, in violation of federal regulations and their own {$0.00} Liability Policy. 

The fraudulent charges occurred shortly after deposits were made to my account. I have submitted the following documentation to Bank of America to support my claim : Identity theft report from the FTC. 
Government-issued identification. 
Additional supporting documents verifying that I did not authorize or make the transactions in question. 

Despite this, Bank of America has denied my claims, citing the proximity of the withdrawals to the deposits as justification. Additionally, they provided me with documentation showing the dates and times of deposits and withdrawals to the account. However, this information does not validate or justify denying my claim. Simply providing transaction history does not constitute a proper investigation. For Bank of America to deny issuing a refund, they must provide evidence and proof that these charges were not fraudulent or unauthorized. 

Instead of fulfilling their obligation to investigate thoroughly, Bank of America has repeatedly sent me generic responses and advised me to contact EDD for a refund. This response is not only dismissive but also unethical, as EDD can not process refunds for funds already distributed to Bank of America. 

Key Concerns : 1. Violation of Regulation E ( Electronic Fund Transfers Act ) : Bank of America has failed to conduct a proper investigation as required under Regulation E, which mandates that financial institutions resolve claims of unauthorized transactions. 
2. Failure to Honor {$0.00} Liability Policy : Bank of Americas advertised {$0.00} Liability Policy for unauthorized charges has not been honored, leaving me unfairly responsible for fraudulent activity. 
3. Inadequate Investigation : Providing transaction history or dates and times of withdrawals does not prove the legitimacy of these charges. A proper investigation should include evidence and proof that the transactions were authorized by me. 
4. Harmful Financial Impact : This unresolved issue has caused me significant hardship, including eviction and denial of housing opportunities, directly resulting from Bank of Americas failure to address this fraudulent activity.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",CA,94509,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11164071

These errors, as furnished by the creditors listed below, violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am requesting the CFPBs assistance to ensure these matters are thoroughly investigated and that the information is corrected or removed if it can not be substantiated. 

Disputed Accounts and Issues 1. XXXX  XXXX ( Account No. XXXX ) Issue : The account is reported as a charge-off with {$460.00} written off and past due as of XX/XX/XXXX. These details appear inconsistent with my payment history and balance updates. 

Request : Verify the payment history, balance, and charge-off status. Remove or correct any discrepancies if substantiation is lacking. 

XXXX. XXXX ( Account No. XXXX ) Issue : The account is listed as repossessed with an {$8100.00} balance past due. However, the payment history and status updates are unclear and inconsistent with my records. 

On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I was involved in a severe car accident while completing a XXXX delivery. The vehicle was rear-ended, causing serious neck and back injuries that left me unable to work or generate income. The car remained at the repair facility for approximately 1.5 months while the at-fault partys insurance processed the claim and handled repairs. 

During this time, I contacted XXXX Customer Service to explain my situation and request assistance due to these extenuating circumstances. Despite my efforts to keep them informed, XXXX attempted to repossess the vehicle from the repair facility. I managed to make a payment to delay the repossession temporarily, but the vehicle was ultimately repossessed in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Request : 1. Validate the reported payment history, repossession status, and balance.

2. Provide documentation detailing the accounts payment history, repossession procedures, and any charges or balances resulting from the repossession. 

XXXX. Remove or correct any inaccuracies or unverifiable information in compliance with the FCRA. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account No. XXXX ) Issue : The account reflects a past due balance of {$80.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX, alongside delinquencies that do not align with my records. 

Request : Investigate and verify the reported payment history and past due amounts. Remove unverifiable information. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account No. XXXX ) Issue : The account is listed as charged-off with {$220.00} past due. However, prior dispute attempts have not resolved discrepancies in the payment history or charge-off details. 

Request : Reinvestigate and correct any errors in the charge-off or payment records. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account No. XXXX ) Issue : The account is inaccurately listed as a charge-off. Additionally, I have never signed an agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX. My original contract was with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and there is no documentation proving my obligation to XXXX. 

Request : 1. Confirm the accuracy of the charge-off status, payment history, and balance.

2. Remove unverifiable information, as required under : 15 USC 1666b : Billing error correction.

15 USC 1681i : Credit reporting dispute requirements.

15 USC 1681s-2 : Obligations of furnishers to report accurate data.

UCC 9, Part 6 : Repossession compliance.

Summary of Concerns Many of these accounts reference prior disputes that failed to produce conclusive evidence or rectifications. The inaccuracies harm my credit profile and fail to meet the FCRAs requirements for accurate, complete, and verifiable reporting.

Requested Actions 1. Ensure each disputed account is thoroughly reinvestigated.

2. Remove or correct any unverifiable or inaccurate information.

3. Require furnishers to provide documentation supporting their reporting or correct the records as necessary.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please keep me updated on the progress of your investigation and any actions taken to resolve these disputes.

The account was charged off, but the reported balance and other details vary across the three major credit bureaus ( XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX ). The inconsistencies between the credit bureaus may negatively affect my credit score and have caused me significant distress.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Section 1682e ( b ), credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the information they report is accurate and consistent. Despite my attempts to resolve this matter directly with XXXX, they have failed to correct the discrepancies, and the incorrect information remains on my credit report. 

I am requesting that XXXX be required to investigate and correct or remove this inaccurate charge-off report. I believe this issue violates my rights under the FCRA.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,30014,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11162633
2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally dispute several fraudulent accounts and inquiries appearing on my credit reports. These accounts were opened without my authorization or consent and remain reported in violation of federal laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Despite my valid identity theft report, XXXX has unlawfully refused to investigate and remove these accounts, further compounding their violations. 

The accounts in question are : Accounts XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, Equifax, XXXX XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, Equifax, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX  Account : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX, Equifax, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Account XXXX XXXX ( Equifax ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX Equifax, XXXX ) XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX  Account : XXXX ( XXXX, Equifax, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX XXXX XXXX, Equifax ) XXXX XXXX Account : XXXX ( XXXX, Equifax, XXXX ) Experians Unlawful Conduct XXXX has responded to my dispute with an automated email falsely claiming that my identity theft report and supporting evidence are invalid, stating : "" We are responding to your request that information in your personal credit report be blocked due to identity theft. Based on our review of your request and the information available to us, we have determined that either : your request to block was made in error, or, your request to block information was based on a material misrepresentation, or, you knowingly obtained or should have known that you obtained possession of goods, services, or moneys as a result of one or more of the transactions that you are seeking to block. '' This response is both baseless and illegal. I have complied with all legal requirements, including submitting a valid identity theft affidavit. XXXX refusal to block or remove these accounts violates several provisions of federal law : 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 Blocking Information Resulting from Identity Theft : Credit reporting agencies are legally required to block information stemming from identity theft upon receipt of appropriate documentation. XXXX 's failure to comply directly violates this statute. 

15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) Permissible Purposes for Reporting : Reporting fraudulent accounts for which I did not authorize the furnishing of data violates permissible purposes under federal law.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) Reinvestigation of Disputed Information : XXXX is required to perform a reasonable reinvestigation of disputes. Refusing to investigate and relying on automated responses demonstrates clear noncompliance. 

15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports : XXXX is obligated to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the data they report. Allowing fraudulent accounts to remain on my credit report violates this provision. 

15 U.S.C. 1681n Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance : XXXX refusal to address valid disputes constitutes willful noncompliance, making them liable for civil damages. 

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information : The entities reporting these fraudulent accounts have also failed in their legal duty to provide accurate and verified information. 

Conclusion Experians ongoing failure to comply with federal law and their reliance on automated denials are unacceptable and unlawful. I urge the CFPB to investigate Experians conduct and hold them accountable for their violations of the FCRA.

Subject : Request for Deletion of Credit Report Dear XXXX XXXX, Equifax, XXXX and all 3rd party unauthorized credit reporting agencies.

I am writing to formally request the deletion of my credit report due to multiple security breaches and the lack of any active lines of credit under my name. I have experienced five security breaches, including incidents involving Equifax, for which I have received settlements. Additionally, I was affected by a recent credit breach from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

According to the data breach website, my Social Security number and personal information have been compromised by these companies. Given this information, my credit report should have been locked, and there should be no listings or open lines of credit. I have not had any credit accounts for over five years, and due to health issues, I am no longer driving, further reducing my need for credit. 

Furthermore, I request the immediate detection of my credit report to prevent any unauthorized access and the removal of my information from all third-party pre-approval lists. I believe that all three credit bureaus ( Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX ) should have refrained from sharing my information without my consent. 

I also request the deletion of any and all unauthorized information on my report, including but not limited to addresses, phone numbers, income, and any charge-offs. It is essential that my credit report reflects only accurate and authorized information. 

Additionally, I want to bring to your attention the recent lawsuit settled in XX/XX/year>, which held credit reporting agencies accountable for mishandling consumer data. This settlement further underscores the need for the protection of consumers ' personal information and reinforces my request for the deletion of inaccurate information from my credit report. 

Please be advised that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to request the deletion of any inaccurate or unverifiable information. Failure to comply with my request may result in a fine of up to {$1000.00} as stipulated by relevant laws.

I kindly ask that you investigate this matter and provide written confirmation of the deletion of my credit report. Please let me know if you require any additional documentation to support my request. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Based on my investigation through the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not licensed to collect debts in the state of California. As such, the reporting of this account is both inaccurate and unlawful. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 USC 1681e ( b ), Equifax is required to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information contained in consumer reports. Reporting a collection account from an unlicensed entity that is prohibited from collecting debts in California fails to meet this standard. Furthermore, under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ), I have the right to dispute inaccurate or unverifiable information, which obligates Equifax to investigate and remove such information from my credit report if it can not be verified. 

Details of the Disputed Account Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Amount Alleged Owed : {$1400.00} Actions Requested Investigate License Status : Verify through the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not licensed to operate in California. 

Remove the Inaccurate Entry : Permanently delete this collection account from my credit report as the entity has no legal authority to collect debts in my state. 

Provide Written Confirmation : Send me a written response confirming the removal of this account and provide an updated copy of my credit report reflecting the correction. 
Enclosed are the following documents to support my dispute : A copy of my credit report highlighting the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account. 
Documentation from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not licensed to collect in California. 

Equifax must complete this investigation and respond within the 30-day timeframe required under the FCRA. Failure to comply with these obligations will leave me no choice but to escalate this matter by filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and the California Attorney Generals office.

2024-12-15,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I originally signed up for the credit card on XXXX XXXX website to receive free bags. On the site I saw no indication of an annual fee. I specifically avoid cards with anual fees. 

I used the card once and it was paid off, after that I haven't recieved statements in the mail for a {$0.00} balance card. It was my assumption that the card continued to be XXXX balance otherwise I would have received a statement. Citi started to call me and let me know that I owed them the annual fee, the late fee, and interest. I asked if it could be refunded and I was told I needed to be transferred. 

Citi transferred me to a phone line that was telling me that I won a promo and was eligible for a free medical alert device. I initially thought this was Citi and began speaking with XXXX who was telling me about the free medical alert device. During our conversation I realized it was a scam and hung up and called Citi back. 

Citi acknowledged I was on the line and that they did transfer me. The second time they tried to transfer me I was sent to an actual City agent and not a scam. They told me that the timeline is outside of when they can get rid of the annual fee. 

I believe that Citi intentionally waits to provide notice to their customers of an overdue balance for the late fee until they are outside of their policy refund section. Furthermore I believe that City is intentionally making it hard to identify that there is an annual fee. The supervisor I spoke to went so far as to state that nobody reads terms and disclosures acknowledging that if they are there that they are intended to be in a place they are missed. 

The annual fee is {$99.00}, I believe the late fee was already refunded, but I do not have the interest. They claim it was sent, but I did not receive any statements. They stated they do not have any tracking or any proof it was sent besides the system saying it was sent. I do not believe the statement was sent, maybe it fell on the floor in the mail room or something. 

I do not have any documents because I have not received anything. Citi should have the recordings and the transfer log where they transferred me to what seemed like an identity theft hotline. 

I am diligent when signing up for a new credit card to avoid annual fees. If it was easy to spot I wouldn't have signed up for this card, I am also disgusted that Citi would transfer a customer to a line that reeks of being a scam. If this happened to someone over the age of XXXX they likely would have had their identity stolen, because I called Citi I trusted that I was still talking to Citi.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MO,630XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,11162678

Subject : Request for Incorrect Late Payments under the FCRA, specifically 15 USC 1681.

I am writing to dispute an incorrect late payment report on my credit report, specifically in regards to the accounts referenced with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX. 
Upon thorough review of my credit report, I have identified discrepancies in the reporting of these accounts. To the best of my knowledge and records, I have consistently paid these accounts on time and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms.

Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ), my consumer report should not contain information solely as to transactions or experiences between myself and your company. Payment history, particularly late payments, negatively impacts my consumer report and constitutes a part of such transactions and experiences.

Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( b ), I request documentation of the reasonable procedures you have in place to ensure that periodic statements are mailed to me no later than 21 days before the payment due date. This documentation should include all information required by 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( b ) regarding the contents of such statements.

Reference to PAANL ( Paid As Agreed Never Late ) : The terms of our agreement have consistently been adhered to. Therefore, the account should be reported with a status of "" Paid As Agreed Never Late '' to accurately reflect my timely payments. Any deviation from this status misrepresents my financial responsibility and commitment to fulfilling my payment obligations.

Request for Proof : To validate the reporting of late payments on these accounts, I request the following : Documented proof supporting the claims of late payments, including dates, amounts, and any relevant communication.

In the absence of valid proof, I demand that these accounts be promptly updated to reflect their accurate status as "" Paid As Agreed Never Late. '' Request for Timely Investigation : In accordance with the ( FCRA ), I request a thorough investigation of this matter and a written response within 30 days of your receipt of this letter. Failure to adhere to this timeline will be considered a violation of the ( FCRA ).

Please treat this as a formal dispute under the ( FCRA ). If the inaccurate reporting is not corrected or a satisfactory resolution is not provided, I may escalate this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) or take legal action to ensure compliance.

Specifically, 1. Current Balance : XXXX does not report a balance, while XXXX and Equifax list {$0.00}. This inconsistency creates confusion, as all agencies should show the same balance. 
2. Date Last Active : Equifax reports the last active date as XX/XX/XXXX, which appears to be an error since it is a future date. 
XXXX shows XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX lists XX/XX/XXXX. This discrepancy should be investigated. 
3. Date of Last Payment : Equifax lists the date as XX/XX/XXXX, while XXXX and XXXX report XX/XX/XXXX. The difference of a few days could be an error if the payments were made simultaneously. 
4. Payment Status : XXXX states that the account was 60 days past due. 
XXXX mentions the account was past due 30 days two or three times. 
Equifax says "" not more than three payments past due ''. These descriptions do not match and should be consistent. 
5. Account Comments : Equifax specifies "" Account Closed by Credit Grantor '', while XXXX says "" Canceled by Credit Grantor ''. Although similar, the wording differs, which could create confusion. 
6. Last Reported Date : Equifax lists the reported date as XX/XX/XXXX, which appears incorrect since it is a future date. XXXX and XXXX show XX/XX/XXXX, which seems more accurate. 


Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 USC 16811 ( 7 ) credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. Additionally, under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 USC 1601, it is imperative that all credit information provided is accurate and transparent to protect consumer rights As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccuracies in my credit report. I request that you conduct a more thorough investigation into this matter, particularly considering the following points : 1. Inconsistencies : There are discrepancies among the three credit bureaus regarding this account, including.

2. Verification Issues : According to Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the FCRA, you are required to verify accounts through original documentation. I request that you provide the supporting documentation you relied upon to verify this account.

3. Consumer Rights : Under Section 611 of the FCRA, if you can not provide adequate documentation to support the validity of this account, you must remove it from my credit report. 
4. Accuracy Compliance : Additionally, under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), you are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information in my credit report. If the information can not be verified, per 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), I request that you delete any unverifiable information. 

I believe 100 % AND THE PROOF IS ATTACH TO THIS COMPLAINT THAN the bureau has failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) in their investigation process.

Specifically, I wish MORE POINT AND VIOLATION HAVE THE EQUIFAX TO MY RIGHT AFTER THE INVESTIGATION THE ACCOUNT HAVE DISCREPANCIES AND INACCURATE : 1. Failure to Investigate Accurately ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) : After submitting a dispute regarding inaccuracies on my credit report, I did not receive a thorough investigation within the mandated 30-day timeframe. The results of the investigation did not adequately address my concerns. 
2.

This misrepresentation creates an incorrect liability and violates consumer protection laws and tax guidelines. 

The account in question is a XXXX XXXX XXXX, issued for use by a separate legal entity. I, as an individual, am not personally liable for this account beyond its connection to the business entity. The card is explicitly a business credit card, not a personal credit card, as designed for business expenses. 

Furthermore, American Express is attempting to charge me {$28000.00}, an amount they have already written off for their tax benefit. Under federal tax law, including 26 U.S.C. 6050P, when a creditor writes off or cancels a debt over {$600.00} for tax purposes, they must issue a 1099-C form to the debtor. If American Express has benefited from writing off this debt, they can not continue to report or pursue it as a personal liability against me.

American Expresss misclassification of this account as an individual account on my personal credit report is inaccurate, misleading, and creates undue harm to my credit standing. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681.

Requested Resolution : XXXX. Ensure the account is correctly classified as a business account and not reported as my personal liability. 
XXXX. Investigate American Expresss attempt to charge {$28000.00} while they have already benefited from writing off the debt for tax purposes. 
XXXX. Confirm compliance with the FCRA and IRS reporting laws.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Dispute of Inaccurate Reporting Account # XXXX Dear Equifax Dispute Department , I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate reporting of the above-referenced account on my credit report. According to your records, this account reflects a balance of {$16000.00}. However, I have documentation ( attached for reference ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that the actual deficiency balance is {$5600.00} after the repossession and sale of the collateral. This discrepancy is not only significant but is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 1681i and related consumer protection laws.

Grounds for Dispute : 1. Inaccurate Reporting ( 1681e ( b ) ) : Under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies must ensure the accuracy and completeness of all information reported. The discrepancy between the actual deficiency balance provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX and the amount being reported by Equifax clearly demonstrates a failure to meet this requirement. 

2. Verification Requirement ( 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ) : I request that you immediately conduct an investigation into this matter and verify the accuracy of the reported balance. If the creditor can not substantiate the reported balance of {$16000.00}, this account must be corrected or deleted from my credit file. 

3. Unfair and Misleading Information : Reporting an inflated balance misrepresents the true state of this account, which negatively impacts my creditworthiness and violates consumer protection principles.

4. Potential Violations of FDCPA ( 807 ) : If this inaccurate balance is being communicated as an attempt to collect a debt, it may constitute a false or misleading representation under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ).

Action Demanded : - Immediately remove or correct the inaccurate reporting of this account within 30 days, as stipulated by the FCRA. 
- Provide written confirmation of the outcome of your investigation. 

Attached to this letter is documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX showing the correct deficiency balance, which unequivocally supports my claim.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",DE,19805,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11163264

Despite your removal of similar inquiries on XX/XX/XXXX, Equifax now refuses to remove the remaining inquiries, even though they are identical in nature and fully supported by 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). This deliberate refusal constitutes willful noncompliance and suggests fraudulent intent. 
Severe Violations and Legal Consequences 1. Violation of FCRA 605-C2 : By refusing to remove inquiries after receiving proper identification and an FTC report , Equifax is in direct violation of its obligations under FCRA 605-C2, which mandates the blocking of fraudulent information upon sufficient notice. 
2. Privacy and Constitutional Violations : The requirement for additional sensitive information, including my Social Security number, represents an unlawful intrusion on my privacy. This is excruciating and unnecessary given the documentation already provided and exposes Equifax to penalties under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for deprivation of rights under color of law. 
3. Potential RICO Violations : Equifaxs actionsremoving some inquiries while arbitrarily refusing othersreveal a pattern of fraudulent activity for financial gain. Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ), such intentional manipulation and misrepresentation of consumer data constitute racketeering Here is a list of all the inquiry dates with the first two letters removed : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Frivolous Conduct Regarding My Consumer Report : Equifaxs recent assertion that they can not locate my consumer report is blatantly false, given their prior actions to remove items from the same file. This raises serious questions about the accuracy, maintenance, and accounting of my report under Equifaxs purview. Such conduct justifies an IRS audit of your entire operation regarding my consumer file. As you are compensated for reporting consumer data, the inconsistencies and misrepresentations herein demand full transparency and investigation into your accounting practices. 
My Formal Demands 1. Immediate Removal of the following unauthorized hard inquiries ( list inquiries here ). 
2. A full investigation into Equifaxs back office team for mishandling my consumer report and committing acts of fraud. 
3. Assurance that my privacy will not be further compromised, including refraining from unnecessary requests for sensitive information. 
4. Written confirmation of compliance with FCRA 605-C2 and an explanation of the irregularities in your handling of my consumer report. 
Supporting Documentation FTC Identity Theft Report Valid proof of identification Prior Equifax correspondence confirming removal of similar inquiries Your continued negligence and inconsistent actions have caused irreparable harm to my creditworthiness and future financial opportunities. Failure to resolve this matter immediately will leave me no choice but to : File a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Pursue litigation for damages, including statutory penalties under the FCRA and RICO Act, Request an IRS audit of Equifaxs handling and accounting of my consumer report data. 
This is a final notice. I trust Equifax will act lawfully, equitably, and expeditiously to correct these egregious violations.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,32308,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11153218

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To Whom It May Concern, I recently visited myFICO.com and was astounded to find a fraudulent account being reported by several entities, including XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and EQUIFAX. This fraudulent account is accompanied by numerous fraudulent inquiries and false information. 

In response to this alarming discovery, Ive made numerous attempts to contact these entities to discuss and resolve the matter. However, Im deeply disappointed to see that the fraudulent account persists on myFICO.com, and the entities involved continue to report it and spread misinformation.

Ive repeatedly contacted these entities to address this issue and discourage the spread of fraudulent information and negative accounts. These accounts are a direct result of identity theft and multiple data breaches committed by XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, and EQUIFAX. 

The devastating impact of identity theft on my credit has made rebuilding my life an arduous task. During this challenging period, Ive thoroughly studied the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), uncovering numerous violations committed by entities such as XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I formally requested immediate action from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Texas State Attorney General, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) to address fraudulent issues perpetrated by XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and XXXX. This constitutes my final warning and a cease and desist order. 

Although I am not a credit repair company or consultant, I am well-informed about the applicable laws and have sworn statements, affidavits of truth, and notarized Federal Trade Commission complaints as evidence in my SOLIDIFYING MY STATEMENTS case. I have identified several violations. 

- 15 USC 1692c ( b ) - 15 U.S. code 1681s-2 - 15 U.S. code 1681a ( 2 ) ( 1 ) - 15 U.S. code 1681 ( 3 ) ( e ) - 15 U.S. code 16811 - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy - 15 U.S. code 1681b - Permissible purposes of consumer report - H.R. 3046 Social Security number privacy and identity Theft Prevention Act of 2007 - Section 326 of the XXXX XXXX XXXX - Gramm- leach-Bliley Act - 15 USC 1681B c-2 Furthermore, Im requesting that all information obtained through identity theft be completely blocked. This action constitutes a formal cease and desist from the fraudulent account number XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, Opening Date : XX/XX/XXXX, Account Status : Closed, Past Due Amount : {$160.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX, Credit Usage Percentage : 163 %, Current Balance : {$8100.00} ). 
- **Last Balance Update : ** XX/XX/XXXX **Recent Inquiries : ** - XXXX XXXX : Inquired on XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX : Inquired on XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX : Inquired XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX  : Inquired on XX/XX/XXXX, requesting an accounting report under 15 US Code 1605 ( a ). However, exceptions apply as per 15 US Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( I ).

The term consumer report doesnt encompass reports solely containing transaction or experience information between the consumer and the reporter, unless the reporter is subject to sections ( 1681s3 ) of this title.. 

I specifically denied authorization to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Equifax to obtain my personal identifying information through aggravated identity theft. The consumer credit contract alone isnt sufficient to validate the debt. Validation requires presenting the account and a signed and dated general ledger statement from the account holder. 

References : - XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Request for accounting XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Consumer Report clearly violates Metro2 compliance. Please provide the Metro2 compliance disclosure on reporting transactions to a consumer report. 

I understand that my Social Security Number ( SSN ) is registered with the Social Security Administration ( SSA ), and any purchases made using it are obligatory under 18 U.S.C. 8. However, XXXX, XXXX EQUIFAX, and XXXX XXXX continue to report fraudulent accounts, which constitutes a violation of the False Claims Act ( FCA ) 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733. Additionally, you are violating 18 U.S.C. 894 for using my consumer report in an extortionate manner to coerce me into paying for alleged debt that I do not owe. 

I am not consenting to these companies sharing my personal information with my consumer report. I did not authorize or permit you to obtain my personal identifying information through aggravated identity theft ( 18 U.S.C. 1028A ). This notice serves as a cease and desist order for any illegal activities, including reporting and collection. It also informs me of my rights to prevent XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX EQUIFAX, and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX from processing my personal data. 

Under 18 U.S.C. 1028A, aggravated identity theft requires more than just a copy of my consumer credit contract to validate a debt. Presenting the account and a signed and dated general ledger statement from the accounts responsible party is essential. Several court cases support this requirement, including XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Request for XXXX XXXX. ( F.R.E. ) XXXX, and 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) prohibit late payments if a finance charge is included. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), mandates verification of original signed consumer contracts for all accounts listed on credit reports to prevent fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I demand verifiable proof, such as an original signed consumer contract with my signature, from the account listed below. Failure to provide this verification will negatively impact my creditworthiness.

FCRA : FCRA : Delete unverified accounts. If you cant provide proof, delete the listed accounts. Block these transactions from your consumer report in four days. Reporting excluded info violates Metro2 compliance. Provide the compliance disclosure when reporting transactions. Title 1.81.5 of the California Consumer Privacy Act applies. Consumers can request inaccurate info corrections. Businesses must disclose this right and use reasonable efforts to correct it. 

Consumers can opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information, as per Section 1798.130 and regulations. Businesses must notify consumers that this info may be sold or shared and provide an opt-out option. ( Added XX/XX/XXXX, by XXXX XXXX, Sec. XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, pursuant to Sec. XXXX of XXXX XXXX. ) XXXX. 
Consumers can opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information at any time. Businesses must provide notice to consumers, as per Section 1798.135, that this information may be sold or shared and that consumers have the right to opt out. ( Added XX/XX/XXXX, by XXXX XXXX, Sec. XXXX. Effective XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, pursuant to Sec. XXXX of XXXX XXXX. ) XXXX. 

I look forward to your response.

Therefore, I demand the deletion of all personal identifiable information from my consumer credit report, except for the following : 1. My full legal name : First and Last Name 2. My address : Address, City, State Zip Code Please delete all other addresses. I can not receive mail or correspondence at these outdated addresses, and I lack access to them.

Additionally, I request the deletion of all other phone numbers. 

Furthermore, I demand that my Social Security Number and Date of Birth be removed from the credit file for privacy reasons. 

I also request the deletion of all information in the Employer section.

Identified Violations and Inaccuracies 1. **Reporting Incorrect Status with Past Due Balance and Charge-Off** : - The report reflects that the account has been charged off and closed. However, it simultaneously lists a **past due amount** of ** $ XXXX as of XXXX XXXX. - A charged-off account indicates that the creditor has written off the debt as uncollectible. Per FCRA guidelines, any charged-off balance can not remain reported as past due, as this misrepresents the current status of the debt. 2. **Future-Dated Entries** : - The report reflects contradictory **future dates** ( e.g., Status Updated : XX/XX/year>, Balance Updated : XX/XX/year> ). These dates are impossible because this report was generated in XXXX XXXX. Reporting future activity is inaccurate, misleading, and violates the FCRAs requirement for fair and accurate reporting. XXXX. **Credit Usage at 118 % ** : - The report states that my credit usage is XXXX % **, which is mathematically incorrect because the credit limit is reported as ** $ XXXX while the current balance is ** $ XXXX. This reflects inaccuracies in balance calculation or credit usage reporting. XXXX. **Ambiguity in Comments and Dispute Resolution** : - The comments indicate the account was previously in dispute investigation complete. However, no documentation or outcome of the investigation was provided to me, violating my right to a proper investigation under FCRA Section 611. 5. **Multiple Reporting Violations** : - **Incorrect Balance Reporting** : The balance and credit usage appear overstated. - **Duplicate Reporting** : The account balance and past due amount seem to be inconsistently reported across sections. Additional Violations in Payment History Reporting 1. **Future-Dated Late Payments** : - The payment history shows **late payments for XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and XXXX XXXX. As of todays date in XX/XX/year>, these months have not yet occurred, and future payments can not be accurately reported as late. This constitutes **false and inaccurate reporting** and is a clear violation of FCRA Section 607 ( b ), which mandates maximum possible accuracy. 2. **Inconsistent Reporting with Past Account Status** : - The account has already been charged off and closed as reflected earlier in the report. A charged-off account should not reflect **ongoing monthly late payments**, as the creditor is no longer expecting regular payments. Reporting multiple late payments after the charge-off date is both redundant and misleading. 3. **Adverse Impact on Creditworthiness** : - These inaccuracies in payment history significantly harm my creditworthiness by misrepresenting my financial behavior and account status. Legal Basis for Dispute Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : - **Section 611** requires that disputed information must be investigated and corrected within 30 days. - **Section 607 ( b ) ** requires maximum possible accuracy of information furnished. - **Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ** prohibits furnishers from reporting inaccurate or unverifiable information. - **Section 605 ( a ) ( 5 ) ** prohibits re-aging or reporting obsolete information. The inaccuracies on this report violate these provisions and misrepresent my creditworthiness, causing harm. Requested Action I demand the following : 1. **Immediate investigation** into the inaccurate reporting under FCRA guidelines . 2. **Removal of the account and of the following : - The past due status and amount, as the account is charged off. - Any future-dated entries, as they are impossible and misleading. - The overstated credit usage percentage and balance inconsistencies. - Inaccurate payment history reporting for future months and redundant late payments post-charge-off. 3. **Documentation** of the investigation results and verification of all corrected information. Failure to Comply If you fail to address these inaccuracies within the 30-day timeframe required by law, I will escalate this matter with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX CFPB ) and explore all available legal remedies under the FCRA.

2024-12-15,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Money was not available when promised,,"I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek your intervention and support with an issue involving Wise, an online financial service provider operating in USA. My funds have been frozen for over 20 days, allegedly due to "" international sanctions, '' which I find entirely unjustified and unacceptable. 
Background I hold a US account with XXXX and recently made a transfer to my Wise account in US nad my fouds have been blocked for investigation when the amount I did transfer was only XXXX. 
I do not understand why this transaction is under investigation. The transfer was initiated from a legitimate bank in the United States to Wise, which I understand operates legally in XXXX & US. As an online financial institution, Wise allows users to conduct transactions from anywhere in the world.

To clarify : The transaction originated from a legal financial institution in the U.S. and was intended for Wise. 
No transfers were made to or from embargoed countries such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. ( again, this was from the U.S. to Wise XXXX ). 
This transaction complies with all legal regulations and should not have been blocked. 
If Wise intends to analyze every transaction I make from the U.S. to Wise moving forward, I would prefer to close my account. I can not afford to have my funds frozen for more than 15 days each time. Therefore, I demand that my funds be immediately returned to my Wise account. While I am willing to close my account with Wise, holding my money for such a prolonged period is unacceptable and constitutes an act of theft. It is illegal for Wise to use my funds to generate interest or make investments without my explicit consent.

XXXX has violated my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and other applicable statutes by : 1. Failing to Provide Required Disclosures : XXXX did not provide me with any disclosures or notifications regarding my rights to opt out of the sharing of my personal information with third parties. 
2. Failure to Honor My Opt-Out Request : I recently sent XXXX a formal opt-out notice, as permitted under 12 CFR 1016.7 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( i ) and 15 USC 6802, requesting that they immediately cease the disclosure of my personal information. Despite this, XXXX has continued to share my information without my authorization, directly violating my federally protected consumer rights. 
Details of the Violations : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681, Section 602 ( a ), it is stated : There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. 
Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX are consumer reporting agencies, and I am the consumer. I have the right to ensure my private information is not shared without my consent. 
This right is further supported by 15 U.S.C. 6801, which declares : It is the policy of Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information. 
A furnisher of information to credit agencies qualifies as a financial institution under this definition. 
Per 15 U.S.C. 1681, Section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) : A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. 
Neither XXXX ( the furnisher of information ) nor the consumer reporting agenciesEquifax, XXXX, or XXXX my consent, written or otherwise, to furnish or report my information. Any prior consent, whether verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or otherwise, is hereby revoked. 
Additionally, 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ) - ( c ) states : A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise the nondisclosure option. 
I was never informed of my right to exercise this option, which constitutes a failure to comply with the law. 
Under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ), it is stated : A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

Moreover, 15 U.S.C. 1681e requires that consumer reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with 1681c and limit the furnishing of consumer reports to authorized purposes under 1681b. Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX have failed to meet this requirement in their handling of my information. 
Lastly, 12 C.F.R. 1016.7 explicitly states : A consumer may exercise the right to opt-out at any time.

I am exercising my right to opt out of all reporting services provided by Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX. 
Requested Resolution : 1. I request the immediate removal of all unauthorized and inaccurate information reported by XXXX from my credit files with Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX. 
2. I demand that XXXX cease all reporting of my personal information and comply fully with my opt-out request. 
3. I request compensation in the maximum allowable amount of {$1000.00} for these violations, as provided under the FCRA and Privacy Act of 1974. 
Impact on Me as a Consumer : XXXX actions have violated my trust, compromised my privacy, and caused undue stress. Their failure to comply with federal laws governing the accuracy, privacy, and proper handling of consumer information has further damaged my ability to ensure my credit file reflects accurate and lawful information. 
I trust the CFPB will investigate XXXX violations and hold them accountable for failing to respect my federally protected consumer rights.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",IL,60617,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11155619

These errors are a direct violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g. This blatant disregard for their legal obligations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), FCRA, and FDCPA reflects systemic failures that perpetuate inequities and reinforces the racial biases that disproportionately harm XXXXXXXX XXXX like myself. By failing to uphold these statutes, these agencies are not only threatening my financial future but are also undermining the very principles of fairness and equality that these laws were designed to protect. 
The accounts and inquiries listed below are unauthorized, fraudulent, or inaccurately reported. Their continued presence on my credit reports has caused significant financial harm, including limiting my access to credit and opportunities to support my growing family. Despite providing the required documentationincluding proof of identity, an FTC fraud report, and a statement identifying these items as fraudulentthese agencies have failed to comply with their obligations to block or remove this information under 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2 within the four days mandated by law. 

Please remove unauthorized/fraudulent inquiries and accounts : XXXXAccounts : XXXX XXXXAccount : XXXX Opened : XXXX : {$98.00} XXXX XXXXAccount : XXXX Opened : XXXX : {$270.00} XXXX XXXXAccount : XXXX Opened : XXXX : {$360.00} XXXX XXXXAccount : XXXX Opened : XXXX : {$230.00} XXXX XXXX XXXXAccount : XXXX Opened : XXXX : {$250.00} Inquiries : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX EquifaxAccounts : XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX Opened : XXXX : {$4700.00} XXXX XXXX XXXXAccount : XXXX Opened : XXXX : {$1000.00} Inquiries : XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX XXXXAccounts : XXXX XXXX : XXXX Opened : XXXX : {$5000.00} XXXX XXXXAccount : XXXX Opened : XXXX : {$3400.00} Inquiries XXXX XXXX CARD - XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX I demand the immediate removal of these accounts and inquiries from my credit reports within the four days required by 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2.

15 U.S. Code 1681c2 - Block of information resulting from identity theft Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.

Failure to comply will result in legal action. By willfully violating the FCRA, I am willing to settle your civil liability damages I have suffered as a result of your violation for {$1000.00} pursuant to FCRA 616 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) [ 15 U.S.C. 1681n ]. Should you fail or refuse to settle the matter by tendering payment in the amount of {$1000.00} within ten ( 10 ) calendar days of receipt of this notice and demand, I will seek actual damages, which are greater than {$1000.00}.

Your failure to act not only harms me but perpetuates systemic injustices that disproportionately affect XXXX XXXX.

As part of the process, they stated they strive for a 24-hour turnaround time for approval or denial. As part of the process, I linked my bank account through the "" Plaid '' service. Within 24 hours, they requested my two most recent pay stubs, which I uploaded. 

On XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, they sent me an email asking to call them. When I spoke with their rep, they said they could not proceed with my application unless I change my bank account to the account where I get the majority of my paycheck direct deposited. My understanding is that no company is allowed to require direct deposit as a condition of credit, much less are they allowed to force you to use a specific direct deposit account. 

I called again later that day to check status and ask them about the direct deposit issue, but they said they had moved the process forward and now needed me to sign my contract. I stated I already signed XXXX at the beginning of the process, and the phone rep said this was just final paperwork. However, when I reviewed the document compared to what I originally signed on XX/XX/XXXX the terms differed : the loan terms which were clearly stated in the original document were a payment of {$220.00} per month, and APR of 30 %, and an interest rate of 22.05 %. The new terms which they told me were just "" final paperork '' were the same documents, except the payment was now {$230.00}, the APR was 33.17 %, and the interest rate was $ 25.07 %.

Upon further investiation online, I see Avant was fined in the past for issues regarding auto pay. I also feel this was a "" bait and switch '' - it's one thing to tell me I can't be approved for what I applid for, it's another to tell me I'm just signing "" final paperwork '', but that paperwork doens't honor the terms of the original application. Had I not looked closely, I'd have been fooled.

This situation feels predatory, dishonest, intended to deceive, and is shady. Their process also has only led me in circles for 5 days when a 24-hour turnaround time was promised - I'm right back at the start, only they tried to trick me and switch the terms without informing me.

I called today and told them I wanted my application to be withdrawn, and I am not interested. Their rep did not do so. She also said I would receive an email confirmation that my application was closed and that I had declined to proceed.

However, this claim is perplexing for several reasons. 

First, I only became a customer of XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/year> when my mortgage servicing was transferred from Bank of America. If XXXX XXXX is attributing these 15 months of alleged late payments to the period before the transfer, this claim must logically originate from Bank of America. However, my Bank of America account does not show any record of missed payments, late fees, or delinquent statements during the period in question. 

This raises serious concerns about the accuracy of XXXX XXXX 's records and the validity of their claim. Furthermore, I have previously been assured verbally by Bank of America that my payment history was in good standing, with no reported delinquencies or missed payments. 

Given the absence of evidence supporting the claim of 15 months of missed payments and the contradictory records from Bank of America, I am left questioning how XXXX XXXX arrived at this conclusion. I have requested clarification and documentation from XXXX XXXX to substantiate their position, but they have yet to provide a satisfactory response. 

This issue further underscores the broader pattern of miscommunication and mishandling that has characterized my experience with XXXX XXXX. I request that XXXX XXXX investigate this matter thoroughly and provide : Documentation explicitly detailing how the 15 months of missed payments were calculated. 
A reconciliation of their records with Bank of Americas, including evidence to justify the transfer of alleged delinquencies.

2024-12-15,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding fraudulent transactions that were debited from my Citibank account ending in XXXX. I am a victim of identity theft, and these unauthorized transactions resulted from this crime. Despite my efforts to resolve this matter, Citibank has not taken appropriate action to investigate the fraudulent charges or recover the funds stolen from my account.

I previously submitted a dispute to Citibank and spoke with several representatives who initially seemed willing to assist in resolving this issue. However, Citibank later denied the claim without providing any update or reason for the denial. The funds stolen from my account were never returned, and I have been left without any clear resolution. This situation has been extremely frustrating, stressful, and difficult, especially given that I need the funds in my account to cover essential medical bills.

Moreover, when I called Citibank to inquire about the status of my dispute, the representative became rude and was unable to provide any meaningful information regarding my claim. I believe Citibank has failed to take the necessary steps to properly investigate this matter and recover the stolen funds. As part of my efforts to resolve this, I have filed an official FTC Report with the Federal Trade Commission for identity theft, which includes the fraudulent transactions.

Below are the items in question that were fraudulently charged to my Citibank account : XX/XX/year> XXXX : {$74.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX  : {$380.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX : {$220.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX : {$57.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX : {$250.00} XX/XX/year>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$250.00} XX/XX/year> XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : {$50.00} XX/XX/year>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$270.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX : {$56.00} The total amount of fraudulent charges is {$1600.00}, which has caused a significant financial burden, especially as I need these funds to cover my medical bills. I request that Citibank immediately re-investigate these transactions as fraudulent and recover the stolen funds from my account. This entire ordeal has added unnecessary financial strain and stress to an already difficult situation.

It is unacceptable that Citibank has not taken proper measures to address this issue. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will assist in ensuring Citibank complies with all necessary regulations to resolve this matter fairly and promptly.

I have been very transparent and forthcoming regarding my hardship and dealing with the illness and passing of my mother and was given a song and dance by their staff about how they were willing to work with me when I got back on my feet. Unfortunately when I got back on my feet and contacted their agents to try and work towards a resolution to get caught back up I was told that there are no options and that I needed to reinstate the entire past due amount. I did not believe this information was correct and when the VA contacted me about the past due payments they told me that the bank should be working with me and allowing me access to the government programs that are available to distressed borrowers with VA loans. This has not happened. My hardship is resolved and I have had a significant change in financial circumstances but Veterans United turns a blind eye and starts the foreclosure process against me. I believe that Veterans United is engaging in unethical servicing practices.

I had contacted the bank during this process to let them know what was going on and explain why I had fallen behind on the payments. As I stated, their agents were initially supportive.

In similar question would be the curiosity if or not such a violating entity has acted in willful even unlawful disregard of consumer rights and their own regulatory responsibilities. 

Did the reporting party ( ies ) act in willful negligence?

I found several credit inquiries on my credit report that I have NO knowledge of. I followed the exact letter of the law and contacted the Credit Bureaus ( XXXX XXXX ) and disputed the validity of these Inquiries. I ALSO contacted the creditors directly.

They declined to substantiate the claim and informed me I could file a fraud report if I WISHED, but they could not help me ANY further!

I submitted IN WRITING a Validation request under the FCRA title 611. This request was ignored by the creditors in question.

While I appreciate that Jefferson Capital Systems has terminated collection efforts and requested deletion of the tradeline, this error has caused me quantifiable financial and emotional harm.

Basis for My Claim for Monetary Damages : 1. Reporting Inaccurate Information : Jefferson Capital Systems , LLC unlawfully reported a debt that they have now admitted to be invalid, as evidenced by their response stating they terminated collection and requested deletion.

2. Impact on My Credit Report : The inaccurate tradeline caused a significant decrease in my credit score, leading to : Denial of credit opportunities. 
Higher interest rates on existing or new financial obligations. 
Emotional distress and time spent disputing this inaccurate information.

3. Negligence and FCRA Violation : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), creditors and collection agencies are required to ensure accurate reporting. The failure to validate the debt before reporting it constitutes negligence, and I believe I am entitled to monetary compensation for damages resulting from this unlawful action.

Relief Sought : I am requesting Jefferson Capital Systems , LLC compensate me for the financial and emotional damages caused by this inaccurate reporting, in the amount of {$10000.00}. This amount reflects the harm to my creditworthiness, my financial opportunities, and the emotional stress incurred. 

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter further and assist me in securing fair compensation from Jefferson Capital Systems , LLC for their error and negligence.

2024-12-15,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Repossession,Account reinstatement or redemption after repossession,"I searched for an answer to my question but the results provide no clear answer. I am needing to know what the TEXAS state law or policy is for the LENGTH OF TIME a finance company must sell a car after they have repossessed it. Its been 5 months and Hyundai Motor Finance has not received the duplicate title and they have not sold the car.

Account No. : XXXX Due to the unexpected employment gap after a mass layoff, Hyundai Motor Finance repossessed my vehicle XXXX months ago but has yet to obtain a duplicate title or sell the car at a private auction. This delay prevents me from purchasing another vehicle unless I add the remaining {$18000.00} balance to the cost of the next car, with the potential of still owing a balance to Hyundai Motor Finance if the sale price falls short of the debt. XXXX has stated they can not provide a timeline for obtaining the title or completing the sale, leaving me with no clear resolution. If timely payment was required to avoid repossession, why is there no urgency to sell the repossessed vehicle? 

Vehicle : ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). 

Since the repossession, Hyundai Motor Finance stated there is no clear date for the vehicle 's sale. The "" Notice of Our Plan to Sell Property '' stated only that the vehicle would be sold "" at a private sale sometime after XX/XX/XXXX, '' leaving the timeline indefinite. I have been told multiple times that the duplicate title was requested but it has never been received and no attempt to escalate and resolve the issue in a timely manner has been made. 

Hyundai Motor Finance did not offer assistance to accommodate my financial situation and would only accept full payment for the vehicle 's return. However, despite repossessing the vehicle, they have not sold it in a timely manner, which undermines the intended purpose of repossession. Per legal requirements, a sale must be "" commercially reasonable, '' which is generally understood to mean within 90 days of repossession. As of XX/XX/XXXX, nothing has been done since XX/XX/XXXX. Per Hyundai Capital Americas company policy, and the contract with stakeholders and investors, Is 130 days without the car being sold and no ETA or sense of urgency, the standard way to business? 

This delay impacts my ability to obtain another vehicle. As long as the full balance on the repossessed XXXX XXXX remains unresolved, it will likely lead to rejection from lienholders if I attempt to finance a new or used car, effectively placing me in a position where I can not move forward without being financially disadvantaged. Additionally, I am working again. I could have resumed monthly payments during this time if Hyundai Motor Finance had permitted it, instead of declining partial payments.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,HYUNDAI CAPITAL AMERICA,TX,78729,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11152731

I signed all the paperwork, made my down payment, secured insurance, and drove off in the car. However, when they submitted my application to the bank, the process became unusually lengthy. During this time, I repeatedly asked if the transaction was legitimate, as it began to feel like a scam. To make matters worse, they charged me more than we had originally agreed upon. 

When the bank did not approve the loan, the dealership ran my credit multiple times without my consent. They then pressured me into signing a new contract but refused to provide me with a copy. Meanwhile, they put me in a rental vehicle, claiming they needed to "" fix '' the XXXX. When I returned, they demanded a larger deposit and instructed me to provide inaccurate information to the bank. I refused to lie or engage in fraudulent practices. 

I repeatedly asked for a refund or to return the vehicle, but they refused, stating I was already the registered owner with the XXXX and owed them {$10000.00}. At that point, I was unclear about what I was being charged for. I constantly felt uneasy, worried they might repossess the car over this mysterious debt. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after consulting with the new bank and correcting the inaccurate information, I ultimately decided to return the vehicle.

However, this claim is perplexing for several reasons. 

First, I only became a customer of Selene Finance in XX/XX/year> when my mortgage servicing was transferred from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. If Selene Finance is attributing these 15 months of alleged late payments to the period before the transfer, this claim must logically originate from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. However, my XXXX  XXXX XXXX account does not show any record of missed payments, late fees, or delinquent statements during the period in question. 

This raises serious concerns about the accuracy of Selene Finance 's records and the validity of their claim. Furthermore, I have previously been assured verbally by XXXX  XXXX XXXX that my payment history was in good standing, with no reported delinquencies or missed payments. 

Given the absence of evidence supporting the claim of 15 months of missed payments and the contradictory records from XXXX  XXXX XXXX, I am left questioning how Selene Finance arrived at this conclusion. I have requested clarification and documentation from Selene Finance to substantiate their position, but they have yet to provide a satisfactory response.

I provided full payment and was met with my minimum payment amount increasing from {$100.00} in XXXX to {$250.00} in XXXX. I did not use the card for any payments. I have also been issued credit cards for the past XXXX decades without such actions being taken despite a late payment. I understand being charged a late fee, but not having my payment doubled for no reason. When I inquired about this issue with Wells Fargo, I was met with confusing logic regarding APR calculations. I explained to Wells Fargo that no other credit card company has applied this practice before. I last spoke with a Wells Fargo representative in XXXX as to why, with no additional activity, my minimum payment was still high. I also mentioned the CFPB as an outlet for additional conversation. Wells Fargo immediately interrogated me and directly asked if I felt I was being discriminated against. I said I was looking for information and a conversation. At no time did I state any form of the word "" discrimination. '' I was left with the impression that someone would contact me. I received an email from Wells Fargo that I would only receive a {$50.00} credit. The next statement was issued days after. Again, I had not used my card and was waiting for additional dialogue from the company. My minimum payment jumped from {$230.00} to {$490.00}, I find this to be in bad faith, discriminatory, and retaliatory for expressing my rights as a consumer to speak with the CFPB. I can not make a {$500.00} payment, and now this amount is {$770.00}. I am happy to make payments, but when I mentioned the CFPB, this company 's response is to punish me.

On the XXXX, after I had checked out of the first stay and checked in for the second stay that I had booked and paid for separately, the {$150.00} hold fell off. I received a push notification from Cash App stating that it was released. However, after clicking on the notification my account balance was not reflecting that the funds had been returned to my available balance. It was still reading at something like {$8.00}. I brought this issue up with Cash App immediately in their chat support. I was basically told that I am crazy and that the amount had credited back despite my total amount not reflecting such. That customer service agent got tired of dealing with me and kept telling me that they have done everything that they can do for me and sent me back to the beginning of the line for the support chats. I was connected with another representative and they told me that I needed to get a hold of XXXX and get an invoice stating that there is a XXXX balance owed by me to the XXXX. Once that is received then they would be able to look into the matter farther. I have supplied the XXXX balance invoice as requested. As far as I am aware nothing has been done to further investigate this matter and it is being swept up under the rug as if it never happened. The XXXX {$150.00} hold from the XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX is still currently in pending status on my checking account with Cash App. I have questioned this in their Chat Support part of the app on several different occasions. Each time I have tried to address this as an issue I have been told that there is nothing they can do to investigate the matter farther until they receive a XXXX balance invoice from the XXXX. I get the invoice and submit it to Cash App through the chat support. At first I am told that the invoice I supplied that was emailed to me from the XXXX ( supplied screen shots to Cash App via chat support ) and at first they tried telling me that the invoice could not be accepted for this matter. After debating that with the support team on Cash App I was finally told that I must wait the entirety of 30 days before the {$150.00} is released. Once the 30 days have come and gone then they will, I guess, look into it more. This is after they had told me that it is not on them but the XXXX and that XXXX has to release the funds first. I explained to Cash App that the XXXX has assured me that both of the holds for {$150.00} were released a month ago and that there is nothing else that the XXXX can do.

Initially, I was told the payment could not be completed because I had **exceeded the number of transactions permitted on my account**. I requested the following information multiple times : 1. **What are the specific transaction limits? ** 2. **When do these limits reset? ** 3. **How are these limits determined ( number of transactions or monetary amounts )? ** Despite my repeated efforts, Cash App Support refused to provide answers. They stated that they do not have access to this information and could not give me a **timeline** for when I would be able to receive payments again.

Adding to the confusion, I used Cash App **for the same event last year** with far more transactions and experienced **no issues** at that time. This raises questions about why limits are now being applied to my account without explanation.

The companys responses have been inconsistent. At one point, they suggested the issue might be with the **senders account**, despite earlier blaming my accounts limits. When I asked for clarification, I was told **no further details could be provided** and **no further action would be taken**.

-- - **Why This Is a Larger Issue : ** This is not just about the ** {$2.00} payment** ; its about our ability to continue using **Cash App as a trusted platform** to accept payments. If Cash App can withhold funds indefinitely without clear rules, limits, or timelines, it prevents us from using the service effectively for future transactions.

As a business, we rely on Cash App to process payments seamlessly for our customers. If this continues, we will be forced to stop using the platform and inform our customers that Cash App is unreliable for handling payments. 

-- - **Dates and Actions Taken : ** - XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX : ** {$2.00} payment failed. I contacted Cash App Support.

- Support stated the failure was due to transaction limits but refused to clarify what those limits are or when they reset.

- I repeatedly asked for transparency, resolution, or escalation to someone who could provide answers.

- Support gave conflicting information, suggesting the issue might be with the sender, without providing proof or guidance. 

**Amount Involved : ** {$2.00}. 

-- - **Actions Taken by Me : ** - Contacted Cash App Support through their in-app chat multiple times.

- Asked for clear details about the transaction limits and how they apply.

- Requested escalation to a manager, which led to no actionable resolution. 

-- - **Actions Taken by the Company : ** - Failed to provide transparency regarding limits on my account. 
- Gave inconsistent responses, initially blaming my account and later suggesting the sender was the issue. 
- Refused to provide a timeline for resolution or steps to avoid this issue in the future. 

This lack of transparency has made it impossible to rely on Cash App for payments. As a widely used platform, Cash App must provide clear and consistent rules so businesses and individuals can trust their service. Without this, we can not confidently use or recommend Cash App to our customers.",,"Block, Inc.",TX,76513,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11161038

A previous time, the hotel put a hold on my account which reflected in my account as a negative debt ( a charge ). I was paid by my job shortly after that so the account was brought to positive. About a week later, I was making separate purchases and transferred funds from my savings to my checking in the exact amount I needed for the purchases. Two days later, the bank charges me XXXX overdraft fees for those XXXX purchases because the hotel fee was somehow removed and charges again between the time that it was already charged and the time I made my next purchase. This also caused every future automatic payment to generate an overdraft fee. I called in at XXXX fees to which degree they said they would reverse only XXXX. I paid for my charges minus the fees they said would reverse. The next day I get another overdraft fee for another negative charge because they did not reverse their fees as promised.

I did a balance transfer from XXXX XXXX to Citi Bank in the amount of {$2400.00} to reduce my credit card so I could pay the remaining balance off and increase my credit rating for financial needs. After several months I noticed that the payment did not reflect on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called Citi Bank and they insisted and confirmed my account number with XXXX XXXX XXXX that they sent an electronic payment in the amount of {$2400.00} in XXXX. When I called XXXX XXXX XXXX they insisted they never received a payment. I submitted official inquires to both companies. Citi insist they sent the balance transfer via electronic transfer, however, a customer service agent revealed that they sent it to a physical address. This is consistent with XXXX XXXX claims that a check was sent to the wrong address. If this is the case, this could have been resolved back in XXXX. It is possible that XXXX XXXX was only going off the information reported by myself or customer service. With that in mind Neither Card holding company would provide me any proof regardless of multiple request. I also asked that I be allowed to do a three way call with the two companies to try and get this resolved. They both explained they were unable to do this. I did communicate that I was considering hiring an attorney and would be seeking damages and asked kindly to please help me resolve this. Neither company could refer me to a anyone to provide me with information to get this resolved. XXXX XXXX XXXX said in a call on XX/XX/XXXX that Citi bank sent the payment to po box XXXX XXXX, AZ and that is not their address. Citi Bank insist that they sent the payment electronically and 'Now ' denies sending it to po box XXXX. I reported this inaccuracy back in XXXX. Neither credit card company will accept liability. During this time I paid interest an payments on both credit cards. Citi bank continues to charge me for the XXXX and processing fees with interest. XXXX XXXX continues to charge me the XXXX plus significant interest. I was unable to pay my credit card off and this has damaged my credit and kept me from being able to find housing for my family based on my lowered credit rating.

Here is my summary for the attenpts to receive my card : After the XXXX business days was well over for the initial receipt of card, I call customer service mid XXXX and was informed my card was never mailed out. The rep informed me they have no record of the mailing being sent out. They canceled the card and re-issued a new one, standard mail. End of XXXX, well after the standard timeframe that was provided for the replacement, the card did not arrive, I called customer service again and told the same thing, card was never shipped out, this time I was able to get the representative to expedite the card. They stated XXXX business days via XXXX. I waited XXXX or XXXX business days and still no card. Called customer service again and rep told me the same thing, requested to escalate and speak with their XXXX. Managers name was XXXX or XXXX and she informed me there was a note on my account for customer clarification but was unable to contact the mailing associate that noted my account for clarification and told me they were gone for the day. XXXX requested another expedited delivery of my card ( XXXX days via XXXX  ) and told me she would call me XXXX days later to inform me of the status of my card ( whether mailed or not ) and what customer clarification was needed. The interaction with XXXX was held on XX/XX/XXXX. No phone call as I was promised and no card still! I was planning on using this credit card for my familys vacation and the balance used would have been enough to receive the XXXX XXXX XXXX promo. The vacation payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX and because I have not received my card that I was approved for since XX/XX/XXXX, another form of payment was used to fund the vacation.

2024-12-15,Prepaid card,Government benefit card,Problem with a purchase or transfer,Card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase or transfer,"I am filing this complaint regarding Bank of Americas handling of my dispute involving unauthorized transactions on my account. Upon discovering multiple consecutive unauthorized transactions that ultimately drained my account to a XXXX balance, I promptly called the bank to dispute them. The representative informed me that the system required the disputes to be filed as separate claims. As a result, four claims were submitted for review.

Three of the claims were ruled in my favor, and the bank confirmed those transactions were unauthorized. However, the fourth claim was denied based on reasoning that is inconsistent with the findings of the other claims and unsupported by substantial evidence. The banks denial letter stated : No evidence of inconsistent or aggressive spending or high-velocity transactions associated with a compromised card. 
A pattern of transactions following card funding loads, pausing once the balance was used, and restarting after new funds were loadaed. 
The spending pattern appeared consistent between valid and disputed transactions. 
No failed PIN attempts were detected. 
These points fail to address the most critical and obvious inconsistency : three of the four claims found all the transactions in those claims to be fraudulent. The disputed transactions all occurred consecutively as part of the same fraudulent activity, draining my account to XXXX. If Bank of America determined those transactions were fraudulent, it is unreasonable to conclude that one was authorized without providing specific evidence to support that determination.XXXXAdditionally, the banks reliance on a lack of failed PIN attempts or "" consistent spending patterns '' is flawed, particularly given the high levels of fraud during the XXXX pandemic, including unemployment-related fraud through XXXX. Criminals have become adept at accessing stolen personal informationsuch as mine, which has been compromised in previous data breaches, including the XXXX breachand using it to bypass traditional fraud detection methods. A lack of failed PIN attempts is not a strong argument when unemployment insurance fraud was rampant at that time. 

Despite my request for all investigation details, Bank of America only provided a generic list of transactions, including the date, time, merchant name, location, and amount, which is identical to what is available in my online banking statement. This does not meet the requirements of a thorough investigation under Regulation E.

Bank of America has failed to conduct a reasonable and thorough investigation into my claim, as required by federal law. Their basis for denying the fourth claim is fundamentally flawed, particularly given that three of the four claimsrepresenting parts of the same fraudulent activity involving consecutive transactionswere already found to be fraudulent. I respectfully request that the CFPB require Bank of America to : Reevaluate the denied claim based on a proper and transparent investigation. 
Provide all evidence and documentation used in their investigation, including any merchant logs or records, and a detailed explanation of their reasoning for deny this claim.

I have never had an account with this company nor any record of any type of first notice of debt including rights to dispute from this company. And if I, by chance, even though I have no recollection nor tangible record, naively spoke with a representative of this company over the phone about this debt, I was not informed by that representative that I had a right to dispute this debt nor a specific timeframe to do so.

15 USC 1692g 809. Validation of debts ( a ) Notice of debt ; contents states that within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector. Https : //www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/receipt definition of the word receipt is- a writing acknowledging the receiving of goods or money ; proof, evidence. I have never signed nor received any type of acknowledgement receipt from a mailing service for any mail from this company. I am familiar with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Had I signed a receipt of notice for the proper and legal documentation from this company, I wouldve immediately responded asking for lawful verification of debt or copy of court ordered judgement well within the lawful 30 days allotted. After receiving my response letter with receipt, this company would have to legally cease from collection attempts and remove the account from my credit reports until their proof of verification is sent back to me. This company has reported to my credit reports without observing the FDCPA laws. My credit has been impacted adversely because of this companys irresponsibility. 

My credit reports also show that LVNV FUNDING has provided this alleged account with inaccurate information. The FCRA requires that all data reported from the credit reporting agencies, creditors, or furnishers on a consumer 's report be 100 % ACCURATE, 100 % VERIFIABLE, and 100 % TIMELY. This means no data can be reported that can't be legally PROVEN to be 100 % accurate. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. My XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX credit reports all show different open dates, balances, first date of delinquency, balance due, and/or last date of activities for this same exact account. Therefore making this alleged account full of inaccuracies. 

This is erroneous and flawed reporting that is listed on my credit reports. Not only did LVNV FUNDING not follow lawful FDCPA communications protocol, but it has also broken FDCPA False or Misleading Representations protocol as well. A debt collector, in collecting a debt, may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation. Specifically, a debt collector may not falsely represent the character, amount, or legal status of the debt, or of any services rendered, or compensation he or she may receive for collecting the debt. A debt collector may not communicate, or threaten to communicate, false credit information or information that should be known to be false, including not identifying disputed debts as such. Each of my XXXX credit reports show different information instead of them all showing the exact same information. This is considered a false and misleading representation that this company has submitted to the credit reporting agencies. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has begun to aggressively litigate companies who continuously violate consumer laws. According to consumerfinance.gov, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) took action against the nations two largest debt buyers and collectors for using deceptive tactics to collect bad debts. The Bureau found that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX bought debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacking documentation, or unenforceable. Without verifying the debt, the companies collected payments by pressuring consumers with false statements and churning out lawsuits using robo-signed court documents. The CFPB has ordered the companies to overhaul their debt collection and litigation practices and to stop reselling debts to third parties. 
The CFPB found that XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect debts that they knew, or should have known, were inaccurate or could not legally be enforced based on contractual disclaimers, past practices of debt sellers, or consumer disputes. The companies also filed lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves. These practices violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the XXXX XXXX XXXX Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

The website also stated that Encore and XXXX XXXX XXXX threatened and deceived consumers to collect on debts they should have known were inaccurate or had other problems, said CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX. Now, the XXXX biggest debt buyers in the market must refund millions and overhaul their practices. We will continue to take action to protect consumers from illegal and obnoxious debt collection practices. 

Just as the CFPB took action against the above companies, I am asking the CFPB to take action against this company as well. Please help me get this account removed immediately and conduct an investigation on this company. As a consumer, Im publicly publishing this descriptive complaint on consumerfinance.gov so that others can learn from my experience and so that this government agency can use this information to help work with other violations and complaints from consumers regarding this company. It is not my duty to provide evidence that this alleged debt is not mine. It is the legal obligation of the debt collector to first prove or provide proof of evidence that they can lawfully collect on any alleged debt before a consumer challenges it, accurately report to the credit agencies, and follow all FCRA and FDCPA laws. As of today, they have been very unsuccessful to do so.

2024-12-15,Debt collection,I do not know,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"My credit report shows a reputed collection account XXXX at {$1900.00} with JEFFERSON CAPITAL with different opening dates, balances, first date of delinquency, balance due, and/or last date of activities. I have never had an account with this company nor any record of any type of first notice of debt including rights to dispute from this company. And if I, by chance, even though I have no recollection nor tangible record, naively spoke with a representative of this company over the phone about this debt, I was not informed by that representative that I had a right to dispute this debt nor a specific timeframe to do so. 

15 USC 1692g 809. Validation of debts ( a ) Notice of debt ; contents states that within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector. XXXX XXXX XXXX definition of the word receipt is- a writing acknowledging the receiving of goods or money ; proof, evidence. I have never signed nor received any type of acknowledgement receipt from a mailing service for any mail from this company. I am familiar with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Had I signed a receipt of notice for the proper and legal documentation from this company, XXXX wouldve immediately responded asking for lawful verification of debt or copy of court ordered judgement well within the lawful 30 days allotted. After receiving my response letter with receipt, this company would have to legally cease from collection attempts and remove the account from my credit reports until their proof of verification is sent back to me. This company has reported to my credit reports without observing the FDCPA laws. My credit has been impacted adversely because of this companys irresponsibility. 

My credit reports also show that JEFFERSON CAPITAL has provided this alleged account with inaccurate information. The FCRA requires that all data reported from the credit reporting agencies, creditors, or furnishers on a consumer 's report be 100 % ACCURATE, 100 % VERIFIABLE, and 100 % TIMELY. This means no data can be reported that can't be legally PROVEN to be 100 % accurate. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. My XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX credit reports all show different open dates, balances, first date of delinquency, balance due, and/or last date of activities for this same exact account. Therefore making this alleged account full of inaccuracies. 

This is erroneous and flawed reporting that is listed on my credit reports. Not only did JEFFERSON CAPITAL not follow lawful FDCPA communications protocol, but it has also broken FDCPA False or Misleading Representations protocol as well. A debt collector, in collecting a debt, may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation. Specifically, a debt collector may not falsely represent the character, amount, or legal status of the debt, or of any services rendered, or compensation he or she may receive for collecting the debt. A debt collector may not communicate, or threaten to communicate, false credit information or information that should be known to be false, including not identifying disputed debts as such. Each of my 3 credit reports show different information instead of them all showing the exact same information. This is considered a false and misleading representation that this company has submitted to the credit reporting agencies. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has begun to aggressively litigate companies who continuously violate consumer laws. According to consumerfinance.gov, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) took action against the nations two largest debt buyers and collectors for using deceptive tactics to collect bad debts. The Bureau found that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX bought debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacking documentation, or unenforceable. Without verifying the debt, the companies collected payments by pressuring consumers with false statements and churning out lawsuits using robo-signed court documents. The CFPB has ordered the companies to overhaul their debt collection and litigation practices and to stop reselling debts to third parties. 
The CFPB found that XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to collect debts that they knew, or should have known, were inaccurate or could not legally be enforced based on contractual disclaimers, past practices of debt sellers, or consumer disputes. The companies also filed lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves. These practices violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

The website also stated that XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX threatened and deceived consumers to collect on debts they should have known were inaccurate or had other problems, said CFPB Director XXXX XXXX. Now, the two biggest debt buyers in the market must refund millions and overhaul their practices. We will continue to take action to protect consumers from illegal and obnoxious debt collection practices. 

Just as the CFPB took action against the above companies, I am asking the CFPB to take action against this company as well. Please help me get this account removed immediately and conduct an investigation on this company. As a consumer, Im publicly publishing this descriptive complaint on consumerfinance.gov so that others can learn from my experience and so that this government agency can use this information to help work with other violations and complaints from consumers regarding this company. It is not my duty to provide evidence that this alleged debt is not mine. It is the legal obligation of the debt collector to first prove or provide proof of evidence that they can lawfully collect on any alleged debt before a consumer challenges it, accurately report to the credit agencies, and follow all FCRA and FDCPA laws. As of today, they have been very unsuccessful to do so.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Unable to get your credit report or credit score,Other problem getting your report or credit score,"I am filing this complaint because I have been unable to access my free annual credit report through TransUnions website and mobile app, as well as being unable to file disputes on their platform. This has been an ongoing issue, and despite several attempts to log in and resolve the matter, I have been denied access to my account. 

XXXX XXXX : Attempts to Log In : I have tried multiple times to log in using my credentials, but I repeatedly receive error messages that prevent me from accessing my account. 
Customer Service : I have contacted TransUnions customer service, but no resolution was provided. [ Include specific dates, times, and the names of representatives if possible. ] Dispute Access Blocked : In addition to the login issue, I am unable to file disputes online, which is a violation of my rights under multiple consumer protection laws. 

Laws Potentially Violated : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : TransUnion is violating my right to access my free annual credit report ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ) and my right to dispute inaccurate information on my report ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ). Their failure to allow me to dispute errors online also contradicts their obligation to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure accuracy ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ).

2. Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) : Under the CFPA, TransUnions actions could be considered unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 ). They are failing to provide me with the access I am entitled to under the law.

3. Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTC Act ) : By not providing access to my credit report and blocking my ability to dispute errors, TransUnion is engaging in potentially unfair or deceptive practices, which is prohibited under the FTC Act ( 15 U.S.C. 45 ).

4. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act : TransUnions practices may violate UDAAP provisions ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 & 5536 ) by unfairly restricting access to credit report information and dispute processes.

5. Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ( E-Sign Act ) : If TransUnion is providing electronic access to credit reports and disputes but not making them accessible to me, they may be violating the E-Sign Act ( 15 U.S.C. 7001 ).

6. Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) : By limiting my ability to access my credit report and dispute errors, TransUnion may be violating the ECOA ( 15 U.S.C. 1691 ) by potentially preventing me from accessing my credit history.

7. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) : TransUnions actions may hinder my ability to monitor my credit for identity theft, violating my rights under FACTA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681m ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NC,28658,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,11161350

Subject : Request for Deletion of Credit Report Dear XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TransUnion and all 3rd party unauthorized credit reporting agencies.

I am writing to formally request the deletion of my credit report due to multiple security breaches and the lack of any active lines of credit under my name. I have experienced five security breaches, including incidents involving XXXX, for which I have received settlements. Additionally, I was affected by a recent credit breach from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

According to the data breach website, my Social Security number and personal information have been compromised by these companies. Given this information, my credit report should have been locked, and there should be no listings or open lines of credit. I have not had any credit accounts for over five years, and due to health issues, I am no longer driving, further reducing my need for credit. 

Furthermore, I request the immediate detection of my credit report to prevent any unauthorized access and the removal of my information from all third-party pre-approval lists. I believe that all three credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion ) should have refrained from sharing my information without my consent. 

I also request the deletion of any and all unauthorized information on my report, including but not limited to addresses, phone numbers, income, and any charge-offs. It is essential that my credit report reflects only accurate and authorized information. 

Additionally, I want to bring to your attention the recent lawsuit settled in XX/XX/year>, which held credit reporting agencies accountable for mishandling consumer data. This settlement further underscores the need for the protection of consumers ' personal information and reinforces my request for the deletion of inaccurate information from my credit report. 

Please be advised that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to request the deletion of any inaccurate or unverifiable information. Failure to comply with my request may result in a fine of up to {$1000.00} as stipulated by relevant laws.

I kindly ask that you investigate this matter and provide written confirmation of the deletion of my credit report. Please let me know if you require any additional documentation to support my request. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

2024-12-15,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to dispute the reporting of a charge-off on my credit report for a JPMCB CARD account, which Chase Bank has reported as charged off with {$13000.00} written off. Their reporting is inaccurate and includes multiple misrepresentations regarding my payment history and the accounts status. 

Chase claims that I missed payments during XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. However, this is factually incorrect, as Chase closed my account in XX/XX/XXXX. Despite this closure, Chase has continued to report alleged missed payments for months following the closure, which is a clear misrepresentation. Nowhere in their reporting do they acknowledge that they were the ones who unilaterally closed the account. This deliberate omission further undermines the accuracy and legitimacy of the reported information. 

Prior to XX/XX/XXXX, I made all my payments on time. My bank statements clearly show that all payments throughout XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were made in full and on time. The absence of a payment for XX/XX/XXXX occurred only because Chase abruptly closed the account without providing me with any notice, documentation, or explanation for their actions. 

Chase has reported this debt as a charge-off and claimed a write-off for their tax purposes. However, they have not issued me a Form 1099-C, as required under 26 U.S.C. 6050P of the Internal Revenue Code for canceled debts exceeding {$600.00}. Their failure to issue this form calls into question whether the debt has truly been canceled and whether the charge-off was properly reported in compliance with the law. 

Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act The continued reporting of alleged missed payments from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, despite the account being closed in XX/XX/XXXX, constitutes a serious violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ), which mandates that all furnished information must be accurate, complete, and verifiable. Chases actions have resulted in inaccurate and incomplete reporting, damaging my credit standing and requiring correction. 

Requested Actions I respectfully request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and take the following actions : XXXX. Verify Chases Reporting of Missed Payments : Require Chase to provide verifiable evidence of missed payments for XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, given that the account was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX. Investigate the Account XXXX : Confirm that the account was closed by Chase in XX/XX/XXXX, and review their failure to disclose this closure in their reporting. 
XXXX Review the XXXX XXXX : Determine whether Chase has issued XXXX Form XXXX for the {$13000.00} charge-off. If not, this calls into question the legitimacy of the charge-off, and the notation should be removed from my credit report as unsubstantiated. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this case. It is highly appreciated as it is deeply disturbing.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,92620,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11161869

This account has been reported as charged off with {$13000.00} written off, as reflected on my credit report. JPMCB ( contact information : XXXX, DE XXXX, phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX ) has reported this charge-off despite significant irregularities in their handling of my account. 

First, JPMCB closed my account abruptly and without notice in XX/XX/XXXX. This closure came as a complete surprise, as I had consistently maintained my account in good standing. A review of my payment history will show that I had no missed payments, and I had always paid my account responsibly. Despite this, JPMCB randomly decided to close my account without providing me any reasoning or documentation to explain their decision. 

Second, JPMCB has reported this account as a charge-off and appears to have claimed it as a write-off for their tax purposes, yet they have failed to issue me a Form 1099-C as required under 26 U.S.C. 6050P of the Internal Revenue Code. Creditors are obligated to issue a Form 1099-C when debts of {$600.00} or more are canceled, but JPMCB has not done so in this case. Additionally, in In re Reed, 492 B.R. 261 ( Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 2013 ), the court noted that the issuance of a Form 1099-C serves as evidence of a creditors intent to cancel a debt. The absence of this form raises questions about whether this debt was truly canceled or if the reporting is inaccurate.

This inconsistent reporting violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ), which mandates that all information furnished to credit bureaus be accurate, complete, and verifiable. Without a Form 1099-C or proper explanation of the account closure and subsequent charge-off, the reporting from JPMCB can not be considered accurate or verifiable.

I respectfully request that you investigate this matter and take the following actions : 1. Verify whether JPMCB has issued a Form 1099-C in connection with this charge-off.

2. Investigate the account closure and confirm the accuracy of the charge-off reporting, given my history of timely payments.

3. If JPMCB has not issued a Form 1099-C or can not provide documentation justifying the account closure when payments were in good standing and no missed payments were on the account and charge-off, remove the charge-off notation from my credit report as it lacks proper verification and compliance with applicable laws.

Specifically, I am referring to the provisions outlined under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which addresses civil liability for willful noncompliance. 

It has come to my attention that Equifax has willfully failed to comply with requirements imposed under the FCRA, resulting in damages to me as a consumer. As per the statute, I am entitled to seek damages for any actual harm sustained as a result of such failures, or statutory damages ranging from {$100.00} to {$1000.00}. 

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will be compelled to pursue further action, including filing a claim in small claims court or seeking arbitration. I hope to resolve this matter amicably and urge you to take this letter seriously. 

Please respond to this letter within 15 days, providing a detailed explanation of how you intend to rectify these violations.

I understand that I didnt have perfect payment history and struggled towards the end but Bridgecrest billing wasnt 100 % perfect themself with problems with the ACH autopayments that I didnt set up and I wasnt getting alerts or notification that would explain that even though I made payment on time there was another system or platform ( XXXX  ) managing my loan so while I was using Bridgecrest app to monitor my payments the other system ( XXXX XXXX ) was using ACH autopay caused a return payment on these ACH. Brightcreat app showed no autopay or alerts of return payment while XXXX app had it own system processing auto ACH that I didnt realize or wasnt alerted. I got charges a return payment fees even months I paid on time. I asked Bridgecrest to please not report my account in a negative way because the fact is I did pay off the loan early extra fees and all which means that Im not late on payments if the loan was paid early. Bridgecrest has no reason to report anything negative as the account was paid in full. I repeat. The account was paid in full early. 

False information is the documentation of the last payment that shows the account was paid closed followed by 60 days past due. I respect if Bridgrcreat feels the need to report the negative but they need to highlight and document my file accurately and fair. This is causing harm. The slight unnoticed remarks and missing information is what causing this to read as unsettled incomplete or negative. The missing information is 1. Last monthly payment. 2. Paid in full 3. Correct order of events with the last transaction and file payment paid in full. Period Thats it. No remarks after closed.

Since I did not make the disputed transaction, who did? Because of FISERVs resistance to transparency, I suspect the transaction was committed by someone inside Money Network.

2024-12-15,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"PennyMac Loan Services , LLC Subject : **Dispute of Foreclosure Threat and Violation of Securities Fraud** Violation of SEC ACT OF 1934 SECURITIES FRAUD, VIOLATION OF INDENTURE TRUSTEE ACT AND EFT ACT I am writing to formally dispute the actions and threats of foreclosure associated with the above-referenced loan. I assert that you are in violation of the **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**, **Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) **, and the **Indenture Trustee Act**. Additionally, your actions may constitute **securities fraud**, as I am the sole owner of the property in question as both the assignor, assignee, mortgagor, and holder of the promissory note. Furthermore, I contend that the actions of your institution, including threats of foreclosure, are not legally supported by a valid lien or judgment as required under the law.

**Legal Violations and Claims : ** 1. **Securities Fraud under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934** : According to the **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**, securities fraud occurs when false or misleading representations are made in relation to the sale or transfer of securities. As the original holder and sole owner of the property in question, I dispute any claims that PennyMac Loan Services has a valid lien or ownership over my property. No lien has been recorded in the **UCC-11 system**, and under **UCC law**, any property not listed in the system has no established lien over it. Therefore, any attempt by your institution to claim ownership or threaten foreclosure on the grounds of an invalid or unrecorded lien is a clear violation of the law and constitutes securities fraud.

2. **Lack of Valid Lien** : As the holder of the promissory note and the sole owner of the property, I assert that **no lien** has been filed with the **UCC-11 system**. According to **UCC 9-312** and related statutes, a lien can only be perfected and enforceable if it is properly filed and recorded. Since there is no such lien, PennyMac Loan Services has no legal right to take any action against the property, including the initiation of foreclosure proceedings.

3. **Foreclosure Can not Be Reported or Threatened Without a Judgment** : As per established case law, foreclosure proceedings can not be initiated or threatened without a valid judgment. This principle is supported by several rulings, including **XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), which held that foreclosure threats must be based on a court judgment and not merely on the assertion of an unsubstantiated debt. Moreover, the **Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) **, specifically **15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 5 ) **, prohibits any representation or threat to take actions that can not legally be taken, such as foreclosure without a valid judgment.

4. **Indenture Trustee Act Breach of Fiduciary Duty** : Under the **Indenture Trustee Act**, the trustee for any debt-servicing institution, including PennyMac Loan Services, has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the borrower and to discharge all debts appropriately. By threatening foreclosure without the appropriate legal documentation, PennyMac Loan Services and their trustee have abandoned their fiduciary duty to ensure that the debt is properly managed and discharged.

5. **Fraudulent Banking Practices** : It is well-established under **12 U.S.C. 83** that banks are prohibited from lending money that does not actually exist, and it is illegal to record a deposit from the borrower as a loan extension, only to return the funds to the borrower under the guise of a loan. This practice is fraud, as it misrepresents the transaction and constitutes a false statement of credit extension. 

**Request for remedy** Given the legal violations outlined above, I am requesting the following actions from PennyMac Loan Services : 1. **Immediate Cease of All Foreclosure Threats** : PennyMac Loan Services must immediately stop any actions or threats related to foreclosure on the property until proper documentation of a valid lien is provided, or until a court judgment is entered in support of the claim.

2. **Removal of Any Foreclosure-Related Information from My Credit Report** : Any foreclosure-related information should be immediately removed from my credit report, as no legal basis for such actions exists.

2024-12-15,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"This complaint is a continuum of complaint ID : XXXX. 

On XX/XX/year>, I conducted a transfer from an external account ( credit union ) to Chase, via my Chase checking account, in the amount of {$600.00}. I received a notice that the transfer would be remitted and available on XX/XX/year>. However, when viewing my balance on XX/XX/year>, I noticed that there was no hold pending or funds in my account from the transfer. 

I waited until XX/XX/year> and contacted Chase and was routed to their fraud department. The fraud department informed me that they were unable to verify the name on the external account. In addition, Chase Bank decided to delete the account from my list of external accounts, again. Lastly, Chase failed to inform me, in any manner, that the transaction of {$600.00} was in question by the bank. I asked for a reason why Chase did not contact me to at least verify any information or send me a letter, in addition to deleting the account from my list of external accounts. The representative informed me that the algorithm automatically deletes the account if it is unable to verify the account holder on the remittal side. I informed the representative that Chase 's failure to notify me of the transfer in question resulted in monetary consumer harm, as a credit card bill that I was anticipating paying was to be paid by all the funds from the transfer. As a result, I incurred a delinquent payment and interest fees due to the negligence of Chase. 

While informing the bank of their practice and how it monetarily affected me, I was told that the bank is allowed to do this per the disclosed terms and conditions. I informed the representative that while the bank may be abiding by the terms and conditions, it does not mean the bank 's practice is legal. I stated that the act of the bank is unfair, deceptive, and abusive, and has resulted, at least in my case, monetary harm.

However, since the bank referred me to the account disclosures and digital services agreement, I took a look at both documents. In reviewing the account disclosures, the bank states the following : "" You acknowledge and agree that we may decline or prevent any or all transactions to or from your account, including refusing, freezing, reversing, delaying or returning any specific withdrawal, payment or transfer of funds to or from your account, or removing funds from your account to hold them pending investigation, including in one or more of the following circumstances : Your account is involved in any legal or administrative proceeding ; We receive conflicting information or instructions regarding account ownership, control, funds or activity ; We suspect that you may be the victim of a fraud, scam or nancial exploitation, even though you have authorized the transaction ( s ) ; We suspect that any transaction may involve illegal activity or may be fraudulent ; We are complying in our sole discretion with any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation, including federal asset control and sanction rules and anti-moneylaundering rules, or with our policies adopted to ensure that we comply with those laws, rules or regulations ; or We reasonably believe that doing so is necessary to avoid a loss or reduce risk to us. '' While the bank does state that it may decline any transaction, account disclosures fail to inform a reasonable consumer that if the bank is unable to verify a transaction, or must decline it, that the bank will completely delete the account from the consumer 's records, forcing them to go through the trial deposit and verification process again. The practice of Chase bank in continuously deleting my external account, at least twice, without notice of doing so or reason as to why, has resulted in an unfair, deceptive, and abuse practice to consumers, and presents unjust enrichment to the bank.

As a result, I have requested the bank contact me within two business days or face litigation, due to weakness in disclosures and the abusive, deceptive, and unfair practice done upon me. However, I will give the bank until close of business XXXX, XX/XX/year>, to properly rectify this issue by responding with a reason for the denial, a course of action to prevent this going forward, and the reimbursement of the fees I incurred from the negligence of Chase.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,91016,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11155723

I was blocked from the account. In XXXX my attorney sent a letter to give me full access to the account. 

Selene rejected all negotiations and wer eready to foreclose. 

I found out in XXXX that I qualified for XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I asked the lawyer to get my mortgage statment reinstated with my name and address. He said he still could not figure out why Selene had done that.

I called Selene no less than 30 times trying to get my name restored on the account. I finally get a manager who told me that the issue would be resolved and in fact he told me in all his years he had never seen the actual mortagee replaced with the lawyers name. The mailing address yes, but to have the names placed on the mortgage statement that he had never seen. 

The lawyer sent a cease and desist, Selene responded that it was dated XXXX and not vlaid, obviously the lawyer had a typo. He corrected it. Resent it and I confirmed it was recieved. 

I contimued to call until XXXX and each time I called I referenced the fact that the manager told me it would be resolved and when each rep checked they XXXX you are right and we are going to update notes and get this fixed. 

Finally on XX/XX/XXXX, the rep explained to me that they need a letter from the attorney. I said this is absolutely bonkers, a manager confirmed the letter was sent MONTHS ago and now you are only informing me.

I called my attorney who no longer represents me and he wa
s extremely agitated at Selene. He told me in all his years he had never seen such complete incompetence.

He sent the letter once again.

I again followed up with phones calls and and email and finally resorted to fiiling a complaint.

The first and only response I recieved essentailly made it look like I had a frvilous complaint and that I had been answered. It was completely comical because if you read the letter they are staing we responded to you on the same date as the letter dated as a repsonse to XXXX. 

It gets more comical. I think it was ABUNDANTLY clear my lawyer stopped representing me and with more than XXXX phones ( being conservative ). Since at least XX/XX/XXXX I have been attemtping to take over MY mortgage and have my name replaced on my account. 

Today, Saturday XX/XX/XXXX, I get a letter from Selene stating that I did not provide them with my lawyer contact information as I indicated I am representated by XXXX. They are stating that I did not provide them with suffficient information to contact him, meanwhile all the correpsondence ( monthly statements ) continue to be addresssed and sent to him as recent as XX/XX/XXXX. 

Further, XXXX XXXX, XXXX for a THIRD time my lawyer send a letter stating that he was no longer representing me. I have sent emails stating I am no longer represented by a lawyer.

I have been a customer of Chase and held a personal checking account at the time. I opened the account without problems spurred on by a bonus of {$300.00} to be awarded if I fulfilled certain requirements within 90 days. I was to be paid the bonus within 15 days of completion of the requirements.

Most importantly, the email offer provided a link within the email to take advantage of the offer. This is how I applied for the new small business account and qualified for the offer. The promotion code was included with the email and this was used in conjunction with the offer. I am a sole proprietor.

After I completed the requirements, I expected the {$300.00} bonus to be credited to my account as promised on XX/XX/scrub> 2024. It was not so I called on XX/XX/scrub> 2024, and sent along an email to correct the problem. At first I was told that I did not include the promo code and therefore was not eligible. I reiterated that I responded directly thru the email ad and that the promo code was used. I received a call on XX/XX/year>2024, from someone purporting to be from the executive division telling me that I would get my bonus and that a letter would follow. I never received any letter regarding this matter.

Worse, instead of getting {$300.00} as indicated in the offer, I only received {$220.00}. I called and emailed yet again to determine the problem and was told that since I was subject to backup withholding the money was taken out and sent to the IRS and that I should file for a refund.

I never stated that I was subject to backup withholding and Chase had no right to assume this. It seems that Chase lost the entire application and is making up facts as time goes on. First Chase states I did not use the promo code when I did use the promo code and now it tells me that I am subject to backup withholding when I am not.

Now fast forward, Having the jeep a year payments weren't made towards the car note payment, but paid to have my jeep fixed. I have been reaching out to the dealership to schedule appointments, regarding concerns i was having with the vehicle, to my prevail I was and continually getting the run around. Now the jeep has been repossessed. 

When i went into the dealership, XXXX as I was advised, i was told If i can find my own mechanic, then i can continue to go to my own mechanic and long as i produced reciepts of what I have fixed, then what Stellantis Financial would deduct from that, and then send me the title. 

That hasn't happened, I still don't have the title, the vehicle is currently At XXXX XXXX and Stellantis is giving me until XX/XX/XXXX to pay XXXX. Now when I log into my credit reports, what Stellantis is saying I owe and behind on to retrieve the vehicle, does not say that on my credit report. 

All I want is my title at this point. On my credit report it shows 60 days past due, of only XXXX dollars. I have an appointment scheduled to have the radar replaced, but not my vehicle to have it replaced. Everytime I catch Stellantis in a lie, they do something to my account, now I can't even login to view my statement for XXXX. Last i did check it only showed past due of XXXX. 

I have had it with this company from not receiving any help from dealership on fixing the vehicle, from the issues I have with the vehicle, to just everything. 

As a consumer, I rather put my car note payment towards having a working vehicle, rather than paying a car note on a vehicle that was going out on me and at that time only had it 7 months. now its been a year, 1 year XX/XX/XXXX and im going through XXXX and back getting my title. I present reciepts, no money taken off. Now its like their trying to charge me quadriple what I owe without deducting anything, and witholding my title, now their possible trying to sell the vehicle. 

I'm a XXXX XXXX, that goes to treatment 3x a week. I also work, go to school and take care of my mother who has progressive ms. Im not looking for sympathy or empathy, Im looking for my title to be sent to me. Getting the car fixed cost more, than what the car note payments were. 

I am still wanting to fix the jeep, long as I own it, i will no longer pay Stellantis another car note payment.

I really need my title. I even went as far as contacting a attorney to send a demand letter, Haven't been able to pay that, because of how high getting my jeep fixed costs. I really need some help on retrieval of my vehicle title and having my vehicle towed back to me.

They replaced it and nothing changed. The engine still couldn't start. The problem was not in the starter, but after payment they left and took my WORKING starter. I had to pay them by invoice, otherwise I would have had problems with them.

I took pictures of their starter just in case and the pictures helped me later.

I ordered the towing to the other shop, they fixed the electronic issue and I left the shop on my truck.

In the next 1-2 days, the starter started getting worse and worse. And I came to another shop to check the starter, I was already in other location.

I received one for a whopping {$7.00}. I went to the website and registered/verified my card information. A virtual prepaid debit card for such a low amount is next to useless, so I tried to add to my XXXX gift balance, as that is something you can usually do with prepaid debit cards. XXXX tried to process this but said it was declined. I was shocked that XXXX wouldn't accept a XXXX so I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX number and asked why it was declined by the largest online company in the world. I was told that this particular card is only accepted by select merchants, something that was not made clear in the card information ; he emailed me the list of merchants and it's true, XXXX was not included. It is a very narrow list of merchants that will accept this debit card. Also, if XXXX wanted to request this card be converted into a physical card - something that would be much easier to use - there is a {$3.00} fee. So a {$3.00} fee taken away from {$7.00} would make this worth {$4.00} if you got a physical card. So essentially, Equifax chose the most inconvenient method to XXXX out these payments. They purposefully chose to do this as prepaid debit cards to make it harder for people to actually use this money. That is a whole other scam onto itself and deserves its own lawsuit. Plenty of other companies involved in settlements like this very easily issue their payments via things like XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, even mailing physical checks. Those are all easy to use and they are very clearly options for these companies as it happens ALL THE TIME. I've gotten payments from multiple settlements before and all were easily done via those methods I mentioned before. Equifax very clearly chose to do it in this insidious manner because they know the vast majority of people receiving these "" payments '' thru prepaid cards won't even use them because it's so inconvenient to do so. It is almost laughable the lengths to which Equifax will go to make sure people do not use this money. The fact that this is connected a lawsuit about a data breach that probably caused a lot of people grief and money is insane. It's an insult to everyone, and it is sickening that it's allowed to use these scam tactics to pretend to right any wrongs.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NY,11238,,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11164394

One hiring agent reached out to me about a position, and agreed that we speak through their communication channel known as 'XXXX  '. This company had a website and all the inner workings as a legit company. It was a position where I'd work from home and they would provide all related equipment ( computer/headphones/mouse/etc ). Through dialogue thru the XXXX app, the company started sending checks to purchase required equipment on my own. Once deposit attempts were made, my bank, USAA, immediately shut down my account, and cut ties with me just as quickly. Any remaining funds in the account were immediately seized, as this account was linked to some bill payments. 

Several attempts were made to reach out to USAA reps ( who provided no information or reasoning ) to get some reconciliation on the matter. When I tried to open another checking account with another bank, they kept the deposit and froze the account citing there is a fraud alert on my name from another bank ( USAA ). A couple letters were written as well with little to no response. 

I reached out to the USAA CEO 's office and an rep called back in about a week saying that the matter was resolved, agreed that I had been frauded, and that there is no more issues with the matter. USAA, however, continues to refuse to bank with me ( to which i'm not concerned ) and the fraud alert still remains on my name and SSN.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,GA,30519,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-12-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11161532

Wells Fargo is holding on to my security collateral and not processing it per my request. Which is in violation of the security agreement with Security Exchange Commission. Also, I have remove any Power of Attorney that I may have been given to Wells Fargo directly or indirectly, due to Wells Fargo not upholding their fiduciary duties, so they must honor my request and run my application & tender through the Federal Reserve.
